Show the mechanism of the reaction and explain why this type of reaction is called an elimination reaction.\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\nAlright, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It asks about the major product formed when 1-bromo-2-methylbutane is treated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol. I need to show the mechanism and explain why it's called an elimination reaction. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reactants. 1-bromo-2-methylbutane is an alkyl bromide, specifically a tertiary alkyl bromide because the bromine atom is attached to a carbon that's connected to three other carbons. Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, and it's in ethanol, which is a common solvent for these types of reactions.\n\nI recall that when a strong base like sodium ethoxide is used with an alkyl halide, it can abstract a halogen atom, leading to the formation of alkenes through an elimination reaction. But I should make sure I understand what elimination means in this context.\n\nElimination reactions involve the removal of two atoms or groups from adjacent carbon atoms, resulting in the formation of a double bond. In this case, the bromine atom and a hydrogen atom would be removed, forming a double bond between two carbon atoms.\n\nSo, for 1-bromo-2-methylbutane, the structure is:\n\nCH3\n\n|\n\nCH3-C-CH2-Br\n\nWith the carbon attached to the bromine being the first carbon.\n\nWhen sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, abstracts the bromine, it should follow the E2 mechanism, which is a bimolecular elimination where the base abstracts the halogen while a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon is removed simultaneously, forming a double bond.\n\nIn this case, since the bromine is on the first carbon, and there's a methyl group on the second carbon, the base can abstract the bromine, and a hydrogen from the second carbon can be removed, leading to the formation of 2-methylbut-1-ene.\n\nBut wait, is that the only product? I should consider if there are any other possible elimination pathways.\n\nAlso, I need to consider Zaitsev's rule, which states that the more substituted alkene is generally the major product because it's more stable. In this case, forming 2-methylbut-1-ene would give a more substituted alkene compared to any other possible product.\n\nLet me draw the structures to visualize this better.\n\n1-bromo-2-methylbutane:\n\nCH3-C(CH3)-CH2-Br\n\nWhen the bromine is abstracted, and a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon is removed, it forms a double bond between the first and second carbons, resulting in 2-methylbut-1-ene.\n\nIs there any other hydrogen that could be abstracted to form a different alkene? If I look at the first carbon, it's attached to three methyl groups and a bromine. The adjacent carbons are the second carbon, which has a methyl group and a hydrogen.\n\nWait, actually, in 1-bromo-2-methylbutane, the carbon attached to the bromine is the first carbon, which is connected to three methyl groups. The second carbon is connected to the first carbon and has a methyl group and a hydrogen.\n\nSo, in this case, the elimination would occur between the first and second carbons, removing the bromine and a hydrogen from the second carbon to form the double bond between C1 and C2, resulting in 2-methylbut-1-ene.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of forming 3-methylbut-1-ene, but in this structure, that doesn't seem possible because the third carbon doesn't have a hydrogen adjacent to the second carbon.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's look at the structure again.\n\n1-bromo-2-methylbutane:\n\nCH3-C(CH3)-CH2-Br\n\nCarbon 1: attached to three methyl groups and a bromine.\n\nCarbon 2: attached to the first carbon, a methyl group, and a hydrogen.\n\nSo, elimination would occur between carbon 1 and carbon 2, removing the bromine and a hydrogen from carbon 2, forming a double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 2, resulting in 2-methylbut-1-ene.\n\nIs there any other possible elimination here? It doesn't seem like it because there's no hydrogen on carbon 1 to remove to form a different double bond.\n\nI should also think about the mechanism. In an E2 mechanism, the base abstracts the halogen while a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon is removed, and the electrons from the C-H bond form the double bond with the adjacent carbon.\n\nIn this case, sodium ethoxide, being a strong base, would abstract the bromine from carbon 1, and a hydrogen from carbon 2 would be removed, forming the double bond between carbon 1 and carbon 2.\n\nWhy is this called an elimination reaction? Because two groups are being eliminated from the molecule: the bromine and the hydrogen, and they are being removed from adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond.\n\nI should also consider if there are any rearrangements possible, but in this case, since it's a tertiary alkyl bromide, there might be some rearrangements, but I think the major product would still be 2-methylbut-1-ene.\n\nWait, actually, in tertiary alkyl halides, sometimes Wagner-Meerwein rearrangements can occur, leading to more stable carbocation intermediates. But since this is an E2 mechanism, which is a one-step process without the formation of a carbocation intermediate, rearrangements are less likely.\n\nSo, in this case, the elimination should proceed directly to form 2-methylbut-1-ene as the major product.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of forming 1-butene or other isomers, but given the structure, 2-methylbut-1-ene seems to be the only plausible product.\n\nTo summarize, the major product is 2-methylbut-1-ene, formed via an E2 elimination mechanism, where the bromine and a hydrogen are eliminated from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond.",
