The molar enthalpy of dissolution of NaOH is -44 kJ/mol. Assume that the density of the solution is equal to that of water.\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to calculate the enthalpy change for dissolving 10 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in excess water. The final temperature of the solution is 25\u00b0C, and I'm given the specific heat capacity of the solution as 4.184 J/(g\u00b0C). Also, the molar enthalpy of dissolution of NaOH is -44 kJ/mol. They also mention that the density of the solution is equal to that of water.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what enthalpy change means in this context. Enthalpy change (\u0394H) is the heat absorbed or released during a chemical reaction at constant pressure. In this case, it's the heat change when NaOH dissolves in water.\n\nI know that NaOH is a strong base and it dissociates completely in water. The dissolution process can be exothermic or endothermic. Here, it's given that the molar enthalpy of dissolution is -44 kJ/mol, which means it's exothermic because the negative sign indicates heat is released.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives me the final temperature of the solution as 25\u00b0C. I'm assuming this is the ambient temperature, meaning the solution has reached thermal equilibrium with the surroundings. If the process is exothermic, the solution should have been warmer than the surroundings initially, and then it cools down to 25\u00b0C by releasing heat.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because typically, when calculating enthalpy change for dissolution, we consider the heat absorbed by the solution, using the mass of the solution, specific heat capacity, and temperature change. But here, the final temperature is given as 25\u00b0C, which might be the same as the initial temperature if it's in equilibrium, but that doesn't make sense because dissolving NaOH should change the temperature.\n\nMaybe I need to interpret this differently. Perhaps the 25\u00b0C is the temperature at which the dissolution occurs,  and I need to calculate the enthalpy change based on the amount of NaOH dissolved.\n\nGiven that, I should start by calculating the number of moles of NaOH in 10 grams. The molar mass of NaOH is approximately 40 g/mol (Na: 23, O: 16, H: 1).\n\nSo, moles of NaOH = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol) = 10 g / 40 g/mol = 0.25 mol.\n\nNow, if the molar enthalpy of dissolution is -44 kJ/mol, then for 0.25 mol, the enthalpy change should be:\n\n\u0394H = moles \u00d7 \u0394H_per_mol = 0.25 mol \u00d7 (-44 kJ/mol) = -11 kJ.\n\nBut I feel like I'm missing something here because the problem provides specific heat capacity and mentions the density of the solution is equal to water. Maybe I need to consider the heat absorbed by the solution.\n\nLet me think again. If the dissolution is exothermic, the solution should release heat, but if it reaches 25\u00b0C, which is the same as the ambient temperature, perhaps no net heat is absorbed or released in the process? That doesn't make sense because dissolving NaOH should release heat.\n\nWait, maybe the temperature change of the solution is zero because it's equilibrated with the surroundings, but in reality, during the dissolution, the temperature would change before reaching equilibrium. I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nPerhaps I should use the given molar enthalpy of dissolution directly since it already accounts for the heat change per mole. In that case, my initial calculation of -11 kJ seems straightforward.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the heat absorbed by the solution. The formula is q = m \u00d7 c \u00d7 \u0394T.\n\nI have the specific heat capacity (c) as 4.184 J/(g\u00b0C), but I need the mass of the solution and the temperature change.\n\nAssuming the density of the solution is the same as water (1 g/mL), and assuming I'm adding 10 g of NaOH to excess water,  the mass of the solution would be approximately the mass of water plus the mass of NaOH. But since it's excess water, the mass of water is much larger, and for simplicity, maybe I can approximate the mass of the solution as the mass of water, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, if the density is equal to water, and assuming volume is additive, but since it's excess water, the volume change due to adding 10 g of NaOH is negligible. So, perhaps the mass of the solution is approximately the mass of water plus 10 g of NaOH.\n\nBut without knowing the exact mass of water, I can't calculate the temperature change directly. This is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the molar enthalpy method since it gives a direct way to calculate the enthalpy change based on the amount of NaOH dissolved.\n\nSo, final answer is \u0394H = -11 kJ for dissolving 10 grams of NaOH.",
