Let $D$, $E$, and $F$ be the reflections of $A$, $B$, and $C$ with respect to the sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively. Assume that $D$, $E$, and $F$ are collinear. Show that $\\mathrm{OH}=2 \\mathrm{R}$.\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\nLet's dive into this problem. We have a triangle \\( ABC \\) with its circumcenter \\( O \\), orthocenter \\( H \\), and circumradius \\( R \\). Points \\( D, E, F \\) are the reflections of \\( A, B, C \\) over the sides \\( BC, CA, AB \\) respectively, and we're told that \\( D, E, F \\) are collinear. We need to show that \\( OH = 2R \\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall some properties of triangle centers and reflections. The circumcenter \\( O \\) is the center of the circumscribed circle, the orthocenter \\( H \\) is the point where the altitudes intersect, and the circumradius \\( R \\) is the radius of that circle.\n\nReflecting a point over a line is a transformation that maps the point to another point such that the line is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining the point to its image. So, \\( D \\) is the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\), \\( E \\) is the reflection of \\( B \\) over \\( CA \\), and \\( F \\) is the reflection of \\( C \\) over \\( AB \\).\n\nThe fact that \\( D, E, F \\) are collinear seems like a key condition. Maybe this line has some special properties related to the triangle. I wonder if this line is related to the orthic triangle or the reflection triangle.\n\nLet me think about the properties of reflections over the sides of a triangle. I recall that reflecting a point over a line is equivalent to rotating it by \\( 180^\\circ \\) around the foot of the perpendicular from the point to the line.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the properties of the reflections in terms of vectors. Let's try to express the coordinates of \\( D, E, F \\) in terms of the coordinates of \\( A, B, C \\) and the sides.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the foot of the perpendicular from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\) as \\( D' \\). Then, \\( D \\) is the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\), so \\( D' \\) is the midpoint of \\( A \\) and \\( D \\). Similarly for \\( E \\) and \\( F \\).\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. I recall that reflecting a point over a line can be expressed using vector projections. But that might get too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use properties of isogonal conjugates or other triangle center relationships.\n\nAnother thought: in triangle geometry, there's a concept called the orthic axis, which is the line connecting the orthocenters of the component triangles formed by the orthocenter and the vertices of the main triangle. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nLet me consider the Euler line. I know that in any triangle, the orthocenter \\( H \\), centroid \\( G \\), and circumcenter \\( O \\) are collinear, and this line is called the Euler line. Moreover, the distances satisfy \\( HG = 2GO \\), or equivalently, \\( OG = \\frac{1}{3} OH \\).\n\nBut the problem is about \\( OH = 2R \\), which seems related but not directly connected to the Euler line properties I know.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that in some specific types of triangles, like right-angled triangles, the orthocenter is at the vertex of the right angle, and the circumcenter is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse. But I need a general approach.\n\nMaybe I should look for a relationship between the collinearity of \\( D, E, F \\) and the position of the orthocenter relative to the circumcenter.\n\nLet me try to find a connection between the reflections and the orthocenter.\n\nSuppose I consider the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\) to be \\( D \\). Then, the vector from \\( A \\) to \\( D \\) is twice the projection of \\( A \\) onto \\( BC \\), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of isogonal conjugates or properties related to the circumcircle.\n\nWait, I remember that reflecting the orthocenter over the sides of the triangle gives points that lie on the circumcircle. Specifically, the reflections of \\( H \\) over \\( BC, CA, AB \\) lie on the circumcircle.\n\nIs there a relationship between these reflections and the points \\( D, E, F \\)?\n\nLet me think about it. If \\( D \\) is the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\), and reflecting \\( H \\) over \\( BC \\) gives a point on the circumcircle, perhaps there's a link there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the properties of the nine-point circle, which passes through the midpoints of the sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments from the orthocenter to the vertices.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that directly helps here.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently. Since \\( D, E, F \\) are collinear, maybe I can use properties of perspectivity or collinearity conditions like Menelaus' theorem.\n\nBut that seems too vague without more specific points to work with.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the properties of reflections in terms of similitudes or inversions, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of the Simson line. The Simson line of a point with respect to a triangle is the line containing the projections of the point onto the sides of the triangle. Moreover, the Simson line exists if and only if the point lies on the circumcircle.\n\nBut in this problem, \\( D, E, F \\) are reflections, not projections, so that might not apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the properties of the reflections in terms of the circumcircle.\n\nLet me try to consider the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\) as \\( D \\). Since \\( D \\) is the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\), then \\( D \\) lies on the circumcircle if and only if \\( \\angle BAC = 90^\\circ \\), but I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, actually, in general, the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\) does not necessarily lie on the circumcircle.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the positions of \\( D, E, F \\) relative to the circumcircle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or properties of distances in the triangle to relate \\( OH \\) and \\( R \\).\n\nI recall Euler's formula in geometry, which relates \\( OH^2 = 9R^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 \\), but I think I have the formula wrong. Let me recall properly.\n\nActually, Euler's formula in a triangle states that \\( OH^2 = 9R^2 - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 \\), but I'm not sure about the signs. Maybe I need to look that up, but in the interest of time, I'll try to proceed.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the best approach here.\n\nLet me consider the condition that \\( D, E, F \\) are collinear. Maybe this imposes some specific condition on the triangle, such as it being a right-angled triangle or an isosceles triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this condition holds only when the orthocenter has a specific position relative to the circumcenter.\n\nWait, maybe I can search for known results or theorems related to reflections of vertices over the sides and their collinearity.\n\nAfter a quick search in my mind, I recall that in a triangle, the reflections of the orthocenter over the sides lie on the circumcircle. But in this problem, we are reflecting the vertices over the sides.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the properties of the isotomic conjugate or other triangle center conjugations.\n\nThis is getting a bit too speculative. Maybe I need to try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider coordinate geometry. Perhaps assigning coordinates to the points could help me establish the relationship between the collinearity of \\( D, E, F \\) and the distance \\( OH \\).\n\nLet's place triangle \\( ABC \\) in a coordinate plane. Let me assume that \\( A \\) is at \\( (0,0) \\), \\( B \\) is at \\( (c,0) \\), and \\( C \\) is at \\( (b_x, b_y) \\), with \\( c > 0 \\) and \\( b_y > 0 \\).\n\nThen, side \\( BC \\) has endpoints at \\( B(c,0) \\) and \\( C(b_x, b_y) \\). The equation of line \\( BC \\) can be determined as follows:\n\nThe slope of \\( BC \\) is \\( m_{bc} = \\frac{b_y - 0}{b_x - c} = \\frac{b_y}{b_x - c} \\).\n\nThe equation of line \\( BC \\) is \\( y - 0 = m_{bc}(x - c) \\), which simplifies to \\( y = \\frac{b_y}{b_x - c}(x - c) \\).\n\nNow, to find the reflection of point \\( A(0,0) \\) over line \\( BC \\), I need to find point \\( D \\) such that the line \\( BC \\) is the perpendicular bisector of segment \\( AD \\).\n\nThe formula for the reflection of a point \\( (x_0, y_0) \\) over a line \\( ax + by + c = 0 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\n\\left( \\frac{x_0(a^2 - b^2) - 2y_0 ab - 2a(c + ax_0 + by_0)}{a^2 + b^2}, \\frac{y_0(b^2 - a^2) - 2x_0 ab - 2b(c + ax_0 + by_0)}{a^2 + b^2} \\right)\n\n\\]\n\nBut this seems too cumbersome. Maybe there's a better way to find the reflection.\n\nAlternatively, I can find the foot of the perpendicular from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\), say \\( D' \\), and then \\( D \\) is such that \\( D' \\) is the midpoint of \\( A \\) and \\( D \\).\n\nSo, first, find \\( D' \\), the foot of the perpendicular from \\( A \\) to \\( BC \\).\n\nThe coordinates of \\( D' \\) can be found by solving the system of equations consisting of the line \\( BC \\) and the line perpendicular to \\( BC \\) passing through \\( A \\).\n\nThe slope of the line perpendicular to \\( BC \\) is \\( -\\frac{1}{m_{bc}} = -\\frac{b_x - c}{b_y} \\).\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular line is \\( y - 0 = -\\frac{b_x - c}{b_y}(x - 0) \\), which simplifies to \\( y = -\\frac{b_x - c}{b_y}x \\).\n\nNow, find the intersection point \\( D' \\) of this line with \\( BC \\):\n\nSet \\( \\frac{b_y}{b_x - c}(x - c) = -\\frac{b_x - c}{b_y}x \\).\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( b_y(b_x - c) \\) to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\( b_y^2 (x - c) = -(b_x - c)^2 x \\)\n\nExpand:\n\n\\( b_y^2 x - b_y^2 c = -(b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2) x \\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\( b_y^2 x - b_y^2 c + (b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2) x = 0 \\)\n\nFactor \\( x \\):\n\n\\( x(b_y^2 + b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2) = b_y^2 c \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( x = \\frac{b_y^2 c}{b_y^2 + b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2} \\)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\( y = -\\frac{b_x - c}{b_y}x = -\\frac{b_x - c}{b_y} \\cdot \\frac{b_y^2 c}{b_y^2 + b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2} = -\\frac{(b_x - c) b_y c}{b_y^2 + b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2} \\)\n\nNow, since \\( D' \\) is the midpoint of \\( A \\) and \\( D \\), we can find \\( D \\) as follows:\n\nLet \\( D = (x_d, y_d) \\). Then,\n\n\\( D' = \\left( \\frac{0 + x_d}{2}, \\frac{0 + y_d}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{x_d}{2}, \\frac{y_d}{2} \\right) \\)\n\nBut we already have \\( D' \\)'s coordinates:\n\n\\( \\frac{x_d}{2} = \\frac{b_y^2 c}{b_y^2 + b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2} \\) \u21d2 \\( x_d = 2 \\cdot \\frac{b_y^2 c}{b_y^2 + b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2} \\)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\( \\frac{y_d}{2} = -\\frac{(b_x - c) b_y c}{b_y^2 + b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2} \\) \u21d2 \\( y_d = -2 \\cdot \\frac{(b_x - c) b_y c}{b_y^2 + b_x^2 - 2b_x c + c^2} \\)\n\nThis is getting quite messy. I think coordinate geometry might not be the best approach here due to the complexity of the expressions.\n\nPerhaps there's a better way using properties of triangles and their centers.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the orthocenter and circumcenter again.\n\nI recall that in any triangle, the reflection of the orthocenter over a side lies on the circumcircle. Specifically, the reflection of \\( H \\) over \\( BC \\) is the point \\( H_a \\) on the circumcircle such that \\( H_a \\) is the diametrically opposite point to \\( A \\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nActually, in a triangle, the reflection of the orthocenter over a side lies on the circumcircle, but not necessarily at the diametrically opposite point.\n\nLet me recall: if \\( H \\) is the orthocenter, and \\( H_a \\) is the reflection of \\( H \\) over \\( BC \\), then \\( H_a \\) lies on the circumcircle.\n\nSimilarly, reflections over \\( CA \\) and \\( AB \\) give points \\( H_b \\) and \\( H_c \\) on the circumcircle.\n\nNow, perhaps there's a relationship between these points and the reflections of the vertices over the sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\) is related to the reflection of \\( H \\) over \\( BC \\).\n\nLet\u2019s see: if \\( H_a \\) is the reflection of \\( H \\) over \\( BC \\), and \\( D \\) is the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\), then perhaps \\( D \\) is related to \\( H_a \\) by a translation or rotation.\n\nLet me try to express \\( D \\) in terms of \\( A \\) and \\( H_a \\).\n\nSince \\( H_a \\) is the reflection of \\( H \\) over \\( BC \\), and \\( D \\) is the reflection of \\( A \\) over \\( BC \\), perhaps \\( D \\) is related to \\( H_a \\) by a translation or rotation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the points \\( D, E, F \\) are related to the orthocenter and the circumcenter in a specific way that forces \\( OH = 2R \\).\n\nWait, maybe I can recall that in some special triangles, like isosceles triangles, the angles satisfy certain conditions that lead to the collinearity of \\( D, E, F \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that when \\( OH = 2R \\), the orthocenter lies at a specific position relative to the circumcircle.\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe I need to consider specific properties of the reflections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the reflections \\( D, E, F \\) are related to the angles of the triangle in a specific way.\n\nLet me consider that if \\( OH = 2R \\), then perhaps the triangle is isosceles or has some symmetry that forces the reflections to be collinear.\n\nThis seems too speculative. Maybe I need to consider specific properties of the angles or sides.\n\nUltimately, I think I need to find a general relationship that connects the condition of collinearity of \\( D, E, F \\) with the distance \\( OH \\).\n\nLet me try to prove that if \\( D, E, F \\) are collinear, then \\( OH = 2R \\), and if \\( OH = 2R \\), then \\( D, E, F \\) are collinear, establishing the biconditional relationship.\n\nThis seems like a promising approach, and now I need to find those connections explicitly.",
