        "question": "Calculate the enthalpy change for the following chemical reaction: \n\n2H2 (g) + O2 (g) \u2192 2H2O (l) \n\nGiven the following enthalpy changes: \n\n2H2 (g) + O2 (g) \u2192 2H2O (g) \u0394H = -483.6 kJ/mol \n\n2H2O (g) \u2192 2H2O (l) \u0394H = -40.7 kJ/mol",
        "response": "Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It asks me to calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction where hydrogen gas reacts with oxygen gas to form water in liquid form. The reaction is 2H\u2082 (g) + O\u2082 (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (l).\n\nThey've given me two reactions with their enthalpy changes. The first one is 2H\u2082 (g) + O\u2082 (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (g) with \u0394H = -483.6 kJ/mol. The second one is 2H\u2082O (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (l) with \u0394H = -40.7 kJ/mol.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the enthalpy change for forming liquid water directly from hydrogen and oxygen gases. But the first reaction gives me water in the gas phase, and the second reaction shows the conversion from water gas to liquid water.\n\nI think I can use Hess's Law here, which says that the total enthalpy change of a reaction is the same whether the reaction takes place in one step or several steps. So, if I can manipulate these two given reactions to get the overall reaction I need, I can add up their enthalpy changes to find the total \u0394H.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first reaction: 2H\u2082 (g) + O\u2082 (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (g), \u0394H = -483.6 kJ/mol. This gives me water in the gas phase.\n\nBut I need water in the liquid phase. The second reaction is 2H\u2082O (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (l), \u0394H = -40.7 kJ/mol. This is the condensation of water vapor to liquid water, which releases heat, hence the negative sign.\n\nSo, if I take the first reaction and then add the second reaction, I should be able to get the overall reaction I need.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n1\\. 2H\u2082 (g) + O\u2082 (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (g) \u0394H = -483.6 kJ/mol\n\n2\\. 2H\u2082O (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (l) \u0394H = -40.7 kJ/mol\n\nIf I add these two reactions together:\n\n2H\u2082 (g) + O\u2082 (g) + 2H\u2082O (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (g) + 2H\u2082O (l)\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. The 2H\u2082O (g) on both sides should cancel out.\n\nSo, simplifying:\n\n2H\u2082 (g) + O\u2082 (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (l)\n\nAnd the total \u0394H would be the sum of the \u0394H values of the two reactions:\n\n\u0394H_total = \u0394H1 + \u0394H2 = -483.6 kJ/mol + (-40.7 kJ/mol) = -524.3 kJ/mol\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction 2H\u2082 (g) + O\u2082 (g) \u2192 2H\u2082O (l) is -524.3 kJ/mol.\n\nI think that's it. It makes sense because forming liquid water would release even more heat than forming water vapor since condensation releases additional heat."
