        "question": "Determine whether there exists an infinite sequence of strictly positive integers $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ that satisfies the following two properties:\n\n- Every strictly positive integer appears exactly once in the sequence $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$.\n\n- For every integer $n \\geq 1$, the product $\\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}$ can be written as the $n$-th power of an integer.",
        "response": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out if there's an infinite sequence of strictly positive integers where every positive integer appears exactly once, and for every n greater than or equal to 1, the product of the first n terms of the sequence is a perfect n-th power. That sounds pretty tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the product of the first n terms to be an n-th power. For example, if n=1, then a1 itself should be a perfect 1st power, which is just itself, so that's straightforward. For n=2, a1 * a2 should be a perfect square. For n=3, a1 * a2 * a3 should be a perfect cube, and so on.\n\nNow, the sequence has to include every positive integer exactly once. So it's a permutation of the positive integers. That means that all numbers are used, and none are repeated.\n\nI need to find out if such a sequence exists. Maybe I can try to construct such a sequence or prove that it can't exist.\n\nLet me try to think about the properties that such a sequence must have. Let's consider the prime factorizations of the terms in the sequence. For the product of the first n terms to be an n-th power, the exponents of all primes in the prime factorization of the product must be multiples of n.\n\nSo, for each n, the exponents in the prime factorization of a1 * a2 * ... * an must all be multiples of n.\n\nThis seems like a strong condition. Maybe I can look at small values of n to see if I can find a pattern or find a contradiction.\n\nLet's start with n=1. As I said, a1 is just a positive integer, and since it has to be part of the sequence that includes every positive integer exactly once, let's not worry about it too much yet.\n\nNow, for n=2, a1 * a2 must be a perfect square. Since a1 and a2 are both positive integers and part of the sequence, and every positive integer appears exactly once, a2 must be chosen such that when multiplied by a1, the product is a perfect square.\n\nLet's assume a1 is 1. Then a2 would have to be a perfect square itself because 1 * a2 = a2 needs to be a perfect square. So a2 could be 4, for example (2^2).\n\nBut then, for n=3, a1 * a2 * a3 must be a perfect cube. So 1 * 4 * a3 must be a perfect cube. That means 4 * a3 is a perfect cube. So a3 must be such that 4 * a3 is a perfect cube.\n\nLet's think about what a3 could be. 4 is 2^2, so 2^2 * a3 must be a perfect cube. That means a3 must include at least 2^1 to make the exponent of 2 in the product 3, which is a multiple of 3. So a3 must be at least 2, but 2 is already used because a1 is 1 and a2 is 4, and we need to use each positive integer only once. Wait, is 2 already used? Not necessarily, because a2 is 4, which is 2^2, but 2 itself hasn't been used yet.\n\nSo, if a3 is 2, then 4 * 2 = 8, which is 2^3, a perfect cube. Good, that works.\n\nNow, for n=4, a1 * a2 * a3 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power. So 1 * 4 * 2 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power. That's 8 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power.\n\n8 is 2^3, so 2^3 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power. That means a4 must include 2^1 to make it 2^4, which is 16. So a4 = 2^1 = 2, but 2 is already used as a3. Wait, a3 is 2, so we can't use 2 again.\n\nHmm, maybe choosing a3 as 2 wasn't the best idea. Alternatively, a4 could include other primes to make the exponents work out.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to choose a4 such that 8 * a4 is a perfect fourth power. Since 8 is 2^3, a4 must provide 2^1 to make it 2^4, which is 16. So a4 = 2^1 = 2, but 2 is already used as a3. So that doesn't work.\n\nThis seems problematic. Maybe I need to choose a different value for a2.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Suppose a1 is 1, and a2 is 9 (which is 3^2). Then a1 * a2 = 1 * 9 = 9, which is a perfect square (3^2). Now, for n=3, a1 * a2 * a3 = 1 * 9 * a3 must be a perfect cube. So 9 * a3 must be a perfect cube.\n\n9 is 3^2, so a3 must include 3^1 to make it 3^3, which is 27. So a3 = 3. Now, for n=4, a1 * a2 * a3 * a4 = 1 * 9 * 3 * a4 = 27 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power.\n\n27 is 3^3, so a4 must include 3^1 to make it 3^4, which is 81. So a4 = 3^1 = 3, but 3 is already used as a3. So again, a conflict.\n\nThis suggests that choosing a2 as 9 doesn't work either.\n\nMaybe I need to choose a2 as a number that, when multiplied by a1, gives a perfect square, and also allows a3 to be different from a2.\n\nLet's try a1 = 1 and a2 = 4 (which is 2^2), as I did before. Then a3 must be 2 to make the product a perfect cube, but then a4 can't be 2, which is needed to make the product a perfect fourth power.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to choose a2 such that a1 * a2 is a perfect square, and a3 such that a1 * a2 * a3 is a perfect cube, and so on, ensuring that no number is repeated.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me consider the prime factorizations more carefully. Suppose I have the first n terms of the sequence, a1 through an. The product a1 * a2 * ... * an must be equal to some integer k^n.\n\nNow, consider the exponents of each prime in the sequence terms.\n\nFor each prime p, let's consider the exponent of p in the prime factorization of ai, denoted as ei,p.\n\nThen, for the product a1 * a2 * ... * an to be a perfect n-th power, the sum of the exponents e1,p + e2,p + ... + en,p must be a multiple of n, for all primes p and for all n.\n\nThis seems like a very strict condition. Perhaps I can look for a contradiction by considering specific primes and their exponents.\n\nLet's consider the smallest prime, 2. Suppose a1 = 1, which has no prime factors, so e1,2 = 0.\n\nNow, for n=1, the sum is e1,2 = 0, which is a multiple of 1.\n\nFor n=2, e1,2 + e2,2 must be a multiple of 2.\n\nSince e1,2 = 0, e2,2 must be even.\n\nSo a2 must have an even exponent of 2 in its prime factorization. That means a2 could be 1 (2^0), 4 (2^2), 9 (2^0 * 3^2), etc.\n\nBut a1 is already 1, so a2 can't be 1. So a2 could be 4, 9, 25, etc.\n\nWait, 9 is 3^2, which has e2,2 = 0, which is even. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried a2 = 4 or a2 = 9, I ran into issues with a3 and a4.\n\nMaybe I need to consider more terms to see if a pattern emerges or if there's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps such a sequence cannot exist because of these conflicts in choosing the terms without repeating numbers.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Suppose that such a sequence exists. Then, for each n, the product a1 * a2 * ... * an = k^n for some integer k.\n\nNow, consider n and n+1. We have:\n\na1 * a2 * ... * an = k^n\n\na1 * a2 * ... * an * a_{n+1} = m^{n+1}\n\nDividing the second equation by the first, we get:\n\na_{n+1} = (m^{n+1}) / (k^n)\n\nThis suggests that a_{n+1} is equal to m^{n+1} / k^n.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can find a relationship between k and m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of consecutive products.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of exponents modulo n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sequence in terms of the exponents of each prime separately.\n\nLet me think about the exponents of prime p in the sequence terms.\n\nFor each prime p, the sum of exponents from a1 to an must be a multiple of n, for all n.\n\nThis seems very restrictive. Maybe I can consider the exponents modulo n.\n\nWait, perhaps I can fix a prime p and consider the sequence of exponents of p in the sequence terms.\n\nBut n is varying, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the minimal exponents required to make the product a perfect n-th power.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to consider a finite case first and see if I can generalize it to an infinite sequence.\n\nLet's try to construct a sequence for the first few terms and see if it can be extended.\n\nLet\u2019s set a1 = 1. Then, for n=1, the product is 1, which is 1^1, so that works.\n\nNow, choose a2. a1 * a2 = 1 * a2 must be a perfect square. So a2 must be a perfect square.\n\nChoose a2 = 4 (2^2). Then, for n=2, the product is 1 * 4 = 4, which is 2^2, a perfect square.\n\nNow, choose a3. a1 * a2 * a3 = 1 * 4 * a3 must be a perfect cube. So 4 * a3 must be a perfect cube.\n\n4 is 2^2, so 2^2 * a3 must be a perfect cube. Therefore, a3 must include 2^1 to make it a perfect cube.\n\nSo a3 = 2.\n\nNow, for n=3, the product is 1 * 4 * 2 = 8, which is 2^3, a perfect cube.\n\nNext, choose a4. a1 * a2 * a3 * a4 = 1 * 4 * 2 * a4 = 8 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power.\n\n8 is 2^3, so 2^3 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power. Therefore, a4 must include 2^1 to make it a perfect fourth power.\n\nBut a3 is already 2, and 2 is already used. So a4 can't be 2.\n\nWait, 32 is not yet used, so a4=32.\n\nNow, for n=4, the product is 1 * 4 * 2 * 32 = 256, which is (2^2)^4, a perfect fourth power.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, proceed to n=5.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5=1 * 4 * 2 * 32 * a5 must be a perfect fifth power.\n\n256 is 2^8, so to make it a perfect fifth power, a5 must be 2^{12}, because 8+12=20, which is a multiple of 5.\n\nNow, check if 4096 is already used. So far, a1=1, a2=4, a3=2, a4=32, a5=4096.\n\nAll distinct. Good.\n\nNow, check if the product up to n=5 is indeed a perfect fifth power.\n\nProduct = 256 * 4096 = 1,048,576, which is 2^{20}, which is a perfect fifth power.\n\nSo, it works.\n\nNow, proceed to n=6.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5 * a6 = 1 * 4 * 2 * 32 * 4096 * a6 must be a perfect sixth power.\n\nThe product up to a5 is 2^{20}. Therefore, a6 must be 2^{4}, because 20+4=24, which is a multiple of 6.\n\nSo a6=16.\n\nNow, check if 16 is already used. So far, the sequence is 1,4,2,32,4096,16.\n\nAll distinct.\n\nNow, check if the product up to n=6 is indeed a perfect sixth power.\n\nProduct = 2^{20} * 16 = 2^{24}, which is (2^4)^6, a perfect sixth power.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, proceed to n=7.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5 * a6 * a7 = 2^{24} * a7 must be a perfect seventh power.\n\nTherefore, a7 must be 2^{10}, because 24+10=34, which is not a multiple of 7.\n\nWait, 34 is not a multiple of 7. The closest multiple is 35, which is 7*5.\n\nSo, to make the exponent a multiple of 7, a7 must be 2^{10}, because 24+10=34, which is not a multiple of 7.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, to make 2^{24} * a7 a perfect seventh power, the exponent of 2 in a7 must satisfy 24 + e7,2 \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, e7,2 can be 4, 11, 18, etc.\n\nSo, a7 could be 2^4=16, but 16 is already used as a6.\n\nAlternatively, a7 could be 2^{11}=2048.\n\nCheck if 2048 is already used. The sequence so far is 1,4,2,32,4096,16,2048.\n\nAll distinct.\n\nNow, the product up to n=7 is 2^{24} * 2048=2^{24} *2^{11}=2^{35}, which is (2^5)^7, a perfect seventh power.\n\nGood.\n\nProceeding to n=8.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5 * a6 * a7 * a8 = 2^{35} * a8 must be a perfect eighth power.\n\nTherefore, a8 must be 2^{7}, because 35+7=42, which is a multiple of 8? Wait, 42 is not a multiple of 8.\n\nWait, I need to find e8,2 such that 35 + e8,2 is a multiple of 8.\n\n35 divided by 8 is 4 with a remainder of 3, so 35 \u2261 3 mod 8.\n\nTherefore, e8,2 \u2261 5 mod 8.\n\nSo a8 must be 2^{5}, but 2^5=32 is already used as a4.\n\nAlternatively, a8 could be 2^{13}=8192.\n\nCheck if 8192 is already used. The sequence so far is 1,4,2,32,4096,16,2048,8192.\n\nAll distinct.\n\nNow, the product up to n=8 is 2^{35}*8192=2^{35}*2^{13}=2^{48}, which is (2^6)^8, a perfect eighth power.\n\nGood.\n\nContinuing this way, it seems possible to extend the sequence further by choosing a_n to be 2^{e_n}, where e_n is chosen such that the sum of exponents up to n is a multiple of n.\n\nHowever, this approach relies on using powers of 2, which might not include all positive integers, as required by the problem.\n\nThe problem states that every positive integer must appear exactly once in the sequence.\n\nBut in this construction, I'm only using powers of 2, and many integers like 3,5,6,7, etc., are not included.\n\nTherefore, this approach doesn't satisfy the condition that every positive integer appears exactly once in the sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to include other primes in the sequence.\n\nLet me try to incorporate another prime.\n\nSuppose a1 = 1, a2 = 4 (2^2), a3 = 3 (3^1), a4 = ?\n\nNow, for n=2, a1 * a2 = 1 * 4 = 4, which is 2^2, a perfect square.\n\nFor n=3, a1 * a2 * a3 = 1 * 4 * 3 = 12, which is not a perfect cube.\n\nWait, 12 is 2^2 * 3^1, which is not a perfect cube.\n\nI must have miscalculated.\n\nWait, to make a1 * a2 * a3 a perfect cube, the exponents must be multiples of 3.\n\nGiven a1 = 1 and a2 = 4 (2^2), a3 needs to supply exponents such that the total exponents are multiples of 3.\n\nSo, for 2, we have e1,2 = 0, e2,2 = 2, e3,2 = x. Then, 0 + 2 + x \u2261 0 mod 3 \u21d2 x \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nFor 3, e1,3 = 0, e2,3 = 0, e3,3 = y. Then, 0 + 0 + y \u2261 0 mod 3 \u21d2 y \u2261 0 mod 3.\n\nTherefore, a3 must be 2^1 * 3^{multiple of 3}.\n\nSo, a3 could be 2 * 3^0 = 2, but then a1 * a2 * a3 = 1 * 4 * 2 = 8 = 2^3, which is a perfect cube.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, proceed to a4.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 = 1 * 4 * 2 * a4 = 8 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power.\n\n8 is 2^3, so 2^3 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power.\n\nTherefore, a4 must include 2^1 * k^4, where k is an integer not dividing previous terms.\n\nBut 2 is already used as a3 = 2, so a4 cannot be 2.\n\nPerhaps a4 can be 2^5 = 32, since 2^3 * 32 = 2^8, which is (2^2)^4, a perfect fourth power.\n\nBut in this case, a4 = 32.\n\nNow, for n=4, the product is 1 * 4 * 2 * 32 = 256 = (2^2)^4, a perfect fourth power.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, proceed to n=5.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5 = 1 * 4 * 2 * 32 * a5 = 256 * a5 must be a perfect fifth power.\n\n256 is 2^8, so to make it a perfect fifth power, a5 must be 2^{12}, because 8 + 12 = 20, which is a multiple of 5.\n\nNow, check if 4096 is already used. So far, a1 = 1, a2 = 4, a3 = 2, a4 = 32, a5 = 4096.\n\nAll distinct.\n\nThe product up to n=5 is 256 * 4096 = 1,048,576 = 2^{20}, which is (2^{20/5}), but wait, 2^{20} is not a perfect fifth power.\n\nWait, 2^{20} is a perfect fifth power, since 20 is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo, it works.\n\nNow, proceed to n=6.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5 * a6 = 1 * 4 * 2 * 32 * 4096 * a6 = 2^{20} * a6 must be a perfect sixth power.\n\nTherefore, a6 must be 2^{4}, because 20 + 4 = 24, which is a multiple of 6.\n\nSo a6 = 16.\n\nNow, check if 16 is already used. So far, the sequence is 1, 4, 2, 32, 4096, 16.\n\nAll distinct.\n\nThe product up to n=6 is 2^{20} * 16 = 2^{24}, which is (2^4)^6, a perfect sixth power.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, proceed to n=7.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5 * a6 * a7 = 2^{24} * a7 must be a perfect seventh power.\n\nTherefore, a7 must be 2^{10}, because 24 + 10 = 34, which is not a multiple of 7.\n\nWait, 34 is not a multiple of 7. The closest multiple is 35, which is 7 * 5.\n\nTo make 2^{24} * a7 a perfect seventh power, the exponent of 2 in a7 must satisfy 24 + e7,2 \u2261 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, e7,2 can be 4, 11, 18, etc.\n\nSo, a7 could be 2^4 = 16, but 16 is already used as a6.\n\nAlternatively, a7 could be 2^{11} = 2048.\n\nCheck if 2048 is already used. The sequence so far is 1, 4, 2, 32, 4096, 16, 2048.\n\nAll distinct.\n\nNow, the product up to n=7 is 2^{24} * 2048 = 2^{24} * 2^{11} = 2^{35}, which is (2^5)^7, a perfect seventh power.\n\nGood.\n\nProceeding to n=8.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5 * a6 * a7 * a8 = 2^{35} * a8 must be a perfect eighth power.\n\nTherefore, a8 must be 2^{7}, because 35 + 7 = 42, which is a multiple of 8? Wait, 42 is not a multiple of 8.\n\nWait, I need to find e8,2 such that 35 + e8,2 is a multiple of 8.\n\n35 divided by 8 is 4 with a remainder of 3, so 35 \u2261 3 mod 8.\n\nTherefore, e8,2 \u2261 5 mod 8.\n\nSo a8 must be 2^{5}, but 2^5 = 32 is already used as a4.\n\nAlternatively, a8 could be 2^{13} = 8192.\n\nCheck if 8192 is already used. The sequence so far is 1, 4, 2, 32, 4096, 16, 2048, 8192.\n\nAll distinct.\n\nNow, the product up to n=8 is 2^{35} * 8192 = 2^{35} * 2^{13} = 2^{48}, which is (2^6)^8, a perfect eighth power.\n\nGood.\n\nContinuing this way, it seems possible to extend the sequence further by choosing a_n to be 2^{e_n}, where e_n is chosen such that the sum of exponents up to n is a multiple of n.\n\nHowever, this approach relies on using powers of 2, which might not include all positive integers, as required by the problem.\n\nThe problem states that every positive integer must appear exactly once in the sequence.\n\nBut in this construction, I'm only using powers of 2, and many integers like 3, 5, 6, 7, etc., are not included.\n\nTherefore, this approach doesn't satisfy the condition that every positive integer appears exactly once in the sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to include other primes in the sequence.\n\nLet me try to incorporate the prime 3 into the sequence.\n\nSuppose a1 = 1, a2 = 4 (2^2), a3 = 3 (3^1), a4 = ?\n\nFor n=2, a1 * a2 = 1 * 4 = 4 = 2^2, which is a perfect square.\n\nFor n=3, a1 * a2 * a3 = 1 * 4 * 3 = 12 = 2^2 * 3^1, which is not a perfect cube.\n\nTo make it a perfect cube, the exponents must be multiples of 3.\n\nSo, 2^2 * 3^1 needs to be multiplied by 2^1 * 3^2 = 2 * 9 = 18.\n\nTherefore, a3 should be 18.\n\nWait, but earlier I set a3 = 3.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nSet a1 = 1, a2 = 4, a3 = 18.\n\nThen, a1 * a2 * a3 = 1 * 4 * 18 = 72 = 6^3, which is a perfect cube.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, proceed to a4.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 = 1 * 4 * 18 * a4 = 72 * a4 must be a perfect fourth power.\n\n72 is 2^3 * 3^2, so to make it a perfect fourth power, a4 must be 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nBut 6 is not yet used, so a4 = 6.\n\nNow, check the product: 72 * 6 = 432 = 2^4 * 3^3, which is a perfect fourth power.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, proceed to a5.\n\na1 * a2 * a3 * a4 * a5 = 1 * 4 * 18 * 6 * a5 = 432 * a5 must be a perfect fifth power.\n\n432 is 2^4 * 3^3, so to make it a perfect fifth power, a5 must be 2^1 * 3^1 = 6, but 6 is already used as a4.\n\nAlternatively, a5 could be 2^9 * 3^9, but that's a very large number.\n\nBut in any case, 6 is already used, so this approach doesn't work.\n\nThis suggests that incorporating other primes in this manner leads to conflicts in choosing a5 without repeating numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to include higher powers of primes to make the exponents align properly.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose I fix a set of exponents for each prime such that the sum up to n is a multiple of n for all n.\n\nThis seems challenging, but maybe I can consider the exponents modulo n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a general property that makes such a sequence impossible.\n\nLet me consider the concept of unique factorization and the requirements on the exponents.\n\nFor each prime p, the sum of exponents from a1 to an must be a multiple of n for all n.\n\nThis must hold for all primes p.\n\nThis seems highly restrictive.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the exponents of a prime p in the sequence terms as a sequence of integers, and the partial sums must be multiples of n.\n\nThis seems similar to requiring that the partial sums satisfy s_n \u2261 0 mod n for all n.\n\nThis is a strong condition.\n\nIn number theory, sequences where partial sums satisfy certain congruence conditions have been studied.\n\nI wonder if such sequences can exist for exponents of primes in the factorization of the sequence terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the exponents in terms of arithmetic sequences.\n\nWait, suppose for a prime p, the exponents in the sequence terms form a sequence e1, e2, e3, ... such that the partial sums s_n = e1 + e2 + ... + en \u2261 0 mod n for all n.\n\nThis seems difficult to satisfy for all n.\n\nPerhaps I can consider specific examples.\n\nLet's take p=2.\n\nSuppose e1=0 (since a1=1 has no factor of 2), e2=2 (a2=4=2^2), e3=1 (a3=2=2^1), e4=5 (a4=32=2^5), e5=12 (a5=4096=2^{12}), etc.\n\nThen, the partial sums are:\n\ns1=0 \u2261 0 mod 1\n\ns2=0+2=2 \u2261 0 mod 2\n\ns3=0+2+1=3 \u2261 0 mod 3\n\ns4=0+2+1+5=8 \u2261 0 mod 4\n\ns5=0+2+1+5+12=20 \u2261 0 mod 5\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems to work for the exponents of 2 in the sequence I constructed earlier.\n\nHowever, in that construction, I only used powers of 2, which doesn't include all positive integers.\n\nIf I try to include other primes, it gets complicated, as seen in earlier attempts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe such a sequence cannot exist because it's impossible to arrange the exponents of all primes in such a way that the partial sums are multiples of n for all n and for all primes, while also ensuring that every positive integer appears exactly once.\n\nPerhaps there's a fundamental obstruction based on the properties of integers and their prime factorizations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe such a sequence does exist, and I just haven't found it yet.\n\nLet me consider the properties that such a sequence must satisfy.\n\nGiven that the product of the first n terms is an n-th power, and the sequence is a permutation of the positive integers, perhaps there's a way to arrange the numbers such that their prime exponents align appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the sequence in terms of the exponents of each prime separately is the right approach.\n\nFor each prime p, the sum of exponents in the first n terms must be a multiple of n.\n\nThis must hold for all primes p and for all n.\n\nNow, consider two different primes, say p and q.\n\nTheir exponents in the sequence terms are independent, except for the condition that the sum up to n must be a multiple of n for each prime separately.\n\nThis seems difficult to satisfy simultaneously for all primes and all n.\n\nPerhaps there's a way to show that this is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to construct such a sequence by carefully choosing the exponents for each prime.\n\nBut given the complexity of ensuring that every positive integer appears exactly once without repeating and satisfying the product conditions, it seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that I've tried several constructions and ran into conflicts where numbers needed to be repeated or excluded, I suspect that such a sequence does not exist.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that there does not exist an infinite sequence of strictly positive integers where every positive integer appears exactly once, and for every n \u2265 1, the product of the first n terms is a perfect n-th power."
