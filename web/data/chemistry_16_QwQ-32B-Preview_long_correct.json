        "question": "Calculate the reaction quotient (Qc) for the following reaction at 298 K and 1 atm: \n\n2 NO2(g) + F2(g) \u21cc 2 NO2F(g)\n\nGiven the molar concentrations of reactants and products are [NO2] = 0.25 M, [F2] = 0.15 M, and [NO2F] = 0.10 M at equilibrium.",
        "response": "Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the reaction quotient, Qc, for a given reaction at equilibrium.  The reaction is 2 NO2(g) + F2(g) \u21cc 2 NO2F(g), and I'm given the concentrations of NO2, F2, and NO2F at equilibrium: [NO2] = 0.25 M, [F2] = 0.15 M, and [NO2F] = 0.10 M. The temperature is 298 K and the pressure is 1 atm.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the reaction quotient, Qc, is. From what I recall, Qc is calculated using the same expression as the equilibrium constant, Kc, but it's calculated using the initial concentrations of the reactants and products, not necessarily the equilibrium concentrations. However, in this case, it seems like the concentrations provided are at equilibrium. So, if I calculate Qc using these concentrations, and since the system is at equilibrium, Qc should equal Kc.\n\nBut wait, the problem specifically asks for Qc, not Kc, even though it provides equilibrium concentrations. Maybe it's just a way to test if I understand that at equilibrium, Qc = Kc.\n\nAnyway, to calculate Qc for this reaction, I need to write the expression for Qc based on the balanced equation. The general form for Qc is:\n\nQc = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients\n\nSo, for the reaction 2 NO2(g) + F2(g) \u21cc 2 NO2F(g), the expression for Qc would be:\n\nQc = [NO2F]^2 / ([NO2]^2 [F2])\n\nNow, plugging in the given concentrations:\n\n[NO2F] = 0.10 M\n\n[NO2] = 0.25 M\n\n[F2] = 0.15 M\n\nSo, Qc = (0.10)^2 / ((0.25)^2 * 0.15)\n\nLet me calculate the numerator and the denominator separately to avoid mistakes.\n\nNumerator: (0.10)^2 = 0.01\n\nDenominator: (0.25)^2 = 0.0625, and then 0.0625 * 0.15 = 0.009375\n\nSo, Qc = 0.01 / 0.009375\n\nNow, dividing 0.01 by 0.009375.\n\nLet me see, 0.01 divided by 0.009375.\n\nI can think of this as 1 divided by 0.9375, since both numerator and denominator are multiplied by 1000.\n\nSo, 1 / 0.9375.\n\n0.9375 is 15/16, so 1 / (15/16) = 16/15, which is approximately 1.0667.\n\nSo, Qc \u2248 1.0667\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's 1.07.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the significant figures. The concentrations are given to two decimal places, so maybe I should keep two decimal places for Qc.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? The temperature is given as 298 K and pressure as 1 atm, but since Qc is calculated using concentrations and not partial pressures, and it's at equilibrium, I think that's all I need.\n\nJust to double-check, is there a reason why the problem specifies 298 K and 1 atm? Maybe to ensure I'm using the correct units, but since concentrations are given in molarity, and Qc is based on concentrations, I don't think temperature and pressure directly affect the calculation of Qc in this context.\n\nUnless there's a temperature dependence on the activities or something, but for this level, I think it's safe to proceed as above.\n\nSo, my final answer for Qc is approximately 1.07."
