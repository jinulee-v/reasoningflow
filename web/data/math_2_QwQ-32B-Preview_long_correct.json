Let me recall what floor and fractional parts are. The floor of a number, denoted by \u230ax\u230b, is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, and the fractional part, denoted by {x}, is x - \u230ax\u230b, which is the part of x after the decimal point.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n1. \u230ax\u230b + {y} = 2.4\n\n2. {x} + \u230ay\u230b = 5.1\n\nI need to find |x - y|.\n\nFirst, I should remember that for any real number, x = \u230ax\u230b + {x}, where \u230ax\u230b is an integer and {x} is between 0 and 1 (not inclusive of 1).\n\nSimilarly, y = \u230ay\u230b + {y}.\n\nGiven that, let's look at equation 1: \u230ax\u230b + {y} = 2.4.\n\nSince \u230ax\u230b is an integer and {y} is a fractional part less than 1, their sum is 2.4. That means \u230ax\u230b must be 2, because if it were 3, then even if {y} is less than 1, their sum would be at least 3, which is greater than 2.4. Similarly, if \u230ax\u230b were 1, the maximum sum would be 1 + 0.999... which is less than 2.4. So, \u230ax\u230b = 2.\n\nNow, plugging that back into equation 1: 2 + {y} = 2.4, so {y} = 0.4.\n\nSimilarly, look at equation 2: {x} + \u230ay\u230b = 5.1.\n\nHere, {x} is a fractional part less than 1, and \u230ay\u230b is an integer. Their sum is 5.1, which is between 5 and 6. Therefore, \u230ay\u230b must be 5, because if it were 4, the maximum sum would be 4 + 0.999... which is less than 5.1, and if it were 6, even with {x} being close to 0, the sum would be at least 6, which is greater than 5.1.\n\nSo, \u230ay\u230b = 5.\n\nPlugging that back into equation 2: {x} + 5 = 5.1, so {x} = 0.1.\n\nNow, since x = \u230ax\u230b + {x} = 2 + 0.1 = 2.1,\n\nand y = \u230ay\u230b + {y} = 5 + 0.4 = 5.4.\n\nTherefore, |x - y| = |2.1 - 5.4| = | -3.3 | = 3.3.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nGiven x = 2.1 and y = 5.4,\n\nThen, \u230ax\u230b = 2, {y} = 0.4, so \u230ax\u230b + {y} = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4, which matches equation 1.\n\nSimilarly, {x} = 0.1, \u230ay\u230b = 5, so {x} + \u230ay\u230b = 0.1 + 5 = 5.1, which matches equation 2.\n\nLooks good.\n\nSo, |x - y| = 3.3.",
