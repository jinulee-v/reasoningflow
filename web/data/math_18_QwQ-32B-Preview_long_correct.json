I know that the formula for this sum is \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\). So, I need \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) to be a multiple of 200.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means for this expression to be a multiple of 200. Basically, \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) should be divisible by 200. In other words, \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{200} \\).\n\nBut dealing with modulo 200 directly might be complicated, so maybe I can break it down into smaller parts. I know that 200 factors into \\( 2^3 \\times 5^2 \\), so if I can ensure that \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) is divisible by both \\( 8 \\) (which is \\( 2^3 \\)) and \\( 25 \\) (which is \\( 5^2 \\)), then it will be divisible by 200.\n\nSo, my goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) is divisible by both 8 and 25.\n\nFirst, let's consider divisibility by 8.\n\n### Divisibility by 8\n\nI need \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) to be divisible by 8. But since \\( k \\), \\( k+1 \\), and \\( 2k+1 \\) are consecutive in some sense, I should look at their properties modulo 8.\n\nFirst, note that among any two consecutive integers, one is even. Since \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are consecutive, one of them is even. Moreover, among any three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3. But here, the three terms are \\( k \\), \\( k+1 \\), and \\( 2k+1 \\), which aren't necessarily consecutive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the product \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) and see what it's divisible by.\n\nLet me recall that \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is always divisible by 6 because \\( k(k+1) \\) is divisible by 2 (since one of them is even) and by 3 (since every two consecutive integers include a multiple of 2 and every three include a multiple of 3). But here, we are dividing by 6, so \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) should be an integer, which it is, as it represents the sum of squares.\n\nNow, for \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) to be divisible by 8, \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) must be divisible by \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\). But since \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is already divisible by 6, I need the additional factor to make it divisible by 48, meaning it must be divisible by 8.\n\nWait, actually, since \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is divisible by 6, \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) is an integer. For this integer to be divisible by 8, \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) must be divisible by \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\). But \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is divisible by 6, so I need it to be divisible by 48, which means it must be divisible by \\( 48 / \\gcd(6, 48) = 48 / 6 = 8 \\). Wait, that's not quite right.\n\nLet me think differently. If \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) is to be divisible by 8, then \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) must be divisible by \\( 6 \\times 8 = 48 \\). But since \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is already divisible by 6, I need \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) to be divisible by 48.\n\nNow, 48 factors into \\( 16 \\times 3 \\), but 16 is \\( 2^4 \\), and 3 is already in the 6. Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the prime factors.\n\n6 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\), and 48 is \\( 16 \\times 3 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\). So, \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) needs to be divisible by \\( 2^4 \\times 3 \\). But since it's already divisible by 2 and 3, I need to ensure it's divisible by \\( 2^4 = 16 \\).\n\nSo, essentially, for \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) to be divisible by 8, \\( k \\) must be such that either \\( k \\) or \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 16.\n\nWait, but is that necessarily true? Let's check with some examples.\n\nLet\u2019s take \\( k = 15 \\):\n\n\\( k = 15 \\), \\( k+1 = 16 \\), which is divisible by 16. So, \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 16.\n\nNow, \\( \\frac{15 \\times 16 \\times 31}{6} = \\frac{7440}{6} = 1240 \\). Is 1240 divisible by 8? Let's see: \\( 1240 \\div 8 = 155 \\), which is an integer. So, yes.\n\nAnother example: \\( k = 16 \\):\n\n\\( k = 16 \\), \\( k+1 = 17 \\), \\( \\frac{16 \\times 17 \\times 33}{6} = \\frac{8976}{6} = 1496 \\). Is 1496 divisible by 8? \\( 1496 \\div 8 = 187 \\), which is an integer. So, yes.\n\nAnd \\( k = 14 \\):\n\n\\( k = 14 \\), \\( k+1 = 15 \\), neither is divisible by 16. \\( \\frac{14 \\times 15 \\times 29}{6} = \\frac{6090}{6} = 1015 \\). Is 1015 divisible by 8? \\( 1015 \\div 8 = 126.875 \\), which is not an integer. So, no.\n\nSeems like when either \\( k \\) or \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 16, \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) is divisible by 8.\n\nTherefore, for divisibility by 8, \\( k \\) must be such that either \\( k \\) or \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 16.\n\n### Divisibility by 25\n\nNow, I need \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) to be divisible by 25. Similarly, I can say that \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) must be divisible by \\( 6 \\times 25 = 150 \\). But since \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is divisible by 6, I need it to be divisible by 150.\n\nAlternatively, since 150 is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\), and \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is divisible by 2 and 3, I need to ensure it's divisible by \\( 5^2 = 25 \\).\n\nSo, I need \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) to be divisible by 25.\n\nSince \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are consecutive, one of them is divisible by 5, but for the product to be divisible by 25, I need either:\n\n1. One of them is divisible by 25, or\n\n2. One of them is divisible by 5 and \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 5.\n\nLet me consider these cases.\n\n**Case 1:** \\( k \\) is divisible by 25.\n\nThen \\( k \\) is divisible by 25, so \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is divisible by 25.\n\n**Case 2:** \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 25.\n\nThen \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 25, so \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) is divisible by 25.\n\n**Case 3:** Neither \\( k \\) nor \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 25, but \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 5.\n\nIn this case, since \\( k \\) and \\( k+1 \\) are both not divisible by 5, but \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 5, then the product \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) would have \\( k(k+1) \\) contributing one factor of 5 (since neither is divisible by 5, but their product might be divisible by 5 if one of them is divisible by 5), wait no, if neither \\( k \\) nor \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 5, then their product isn't divisible by 5. But if \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 5, then the product is divisible by 5 from \\( 2k+1 \\), but I need it to be divisible by 25.\n\nSo, in this case, if \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 5, but not by 25, and neither \\( k \\) nor \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 5, then the product is divisible by 5 but not by 25.\n\nTherefore, for the product to be divisible by 25, either \\( k \\) or \\( k+1 \\) must be divisible by 25, or \\( 2k+1 \\) must be divisible by 25.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure that \\( 2k+1 \\) being divisible by 25 helps make the entire product divisible by 25.\n\nLet me think about this differently. I need \\( k(k+1)(2k+1) \\) to be divisible by 25, which is \\( 5^2 \\).\n\nIf \\( k \\) is divisible by 5, then \\( k \\) contributes at least one factor of 5. If \\( k \\) is divisible by 25, it contributes two factors of 5, making the product divisible by 25.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 5, it contributes at least one factor of 5. If \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 25, it contributes two factors of 5, making the product divisible by 25.\n\nIf neither \\( k \\) nor \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 5, then \\( 2k+1 \\) must be divisible by 25 to make the product divisible by 25.\n\nWait, but \\( 2k+1 \\) being divisible by 5 doesn't necessarily mean it's divisible by 25. So, if \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 5 but not by 25, and neither \\( k \\) nor \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 5, then the product is divisible by 5 but not by 25.\n\nTherefore, to have the product divisible by 25, either \\( k \\) or \\( k+1 \\) must be divisible by 25, or \\( 2k+1 \\) must be divisible by 25.\n\nBut I need to find the smallest \\( k \\) where both conditions are satisfied: divisibility by 8 and by 25.\n\n### Combining Conditions\n\nSo, for \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) to be divisible by 200, it must be divisible by both 8 and 25.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n- For divisibility by 8: \\( k \\) or \\( k+1 \\) must be divisible by 16.\n\n- For divisibility by 25: \\( k \\), \\( k+1 \\), or \\( 2k+1 \\) must be divisible by 25.\n\nI need to find the smallest \\( k \\) where both conditions hold.\n\nLet me consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. \\( k \\) is divisible by both 16 and 25.\n\n2. \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by both 16 and 25.\n\n3. \\( k \\) is divisible by 16, and \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 25.\n\n4. \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 16, and \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 25.\n\nI need to find the smallest \\( k \\) that satisfies any of these conditions.\n\nLet's consider each case separately.\n\n**Case 1:** \\( k \\) is divisible by both 16 and 25.\n\nThat is, \\( k \\) is a multiple of \\( \\text{lcm}(16, 25) = 400 \\). So, \\( k = 400m \\) for some positive integer \\( m \\).\n\nThe smallest \\( k \\) in this case is 400.\n\n**Case 2:** \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by both 16 and 25.\n\nThat is, \\( k+1 \\) is a multiple of \\( \\text{lcm}(16, 25) = 400 \\). So, \\( k = 400m - 1 \\) for some positive integer \\( m \\).\n\nThe smallest \\( k \\) in this case is 399.\n\n**Case 3:** \\( k \\) is divisible by 16, and \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 25.\n\nHere, \\( k = 16n \\) for some integer \\( n \\), and \\( 2(16n) + 1 = 32n + 1 \\) is divisible by 25.\n\nSo, \\( 32n + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25} \\), which simplifies to \\( 32n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nSince \\( 32 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25} \\), this becomes \\( 7n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25} \\), or \\( 7n \\equiv 24 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nTo solve for \\( n \\), I can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 7 modulo 25.\n\nThe inverse of 7 modulo 25 is a number \\( x \\) such that \\( 7x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} \\). By testing, \\( x = 18 \\) because \\( 7 \\times 18 = 126 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nSo, \\( n \\equiv 24 \\times 18 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nCalculate \\( 24 \\times 18 = 432 \\). Now, \\( 432 \\div 25 = 17 \\times 25 = 425 \\), so \\( 432 - 425 = 7 \\). Thus, \\( n \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( n = 25p + 7 \\) for some integer \\( p \\), and \\( k = 16n = 16(25p + 7) = 400p + 112 \\).\n\nThe smallest \\( k \\) in this case is 112.\n\n**Case 4:** \\( k+1 \\) is divisible by 16, and \\( 2k+1 \\) is divisible by 25.\n\nHere, \\( k+1 = 16m \\), so \\( k = 16m - 1 \\), and \\( 2k + 1 = 2(16m - 1) + 1 = 32m - 1 \\) is divisible by 25.\n\nSo, \\( 32m - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25} \\), which simplifies to \\( 32m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nSince \\( 32 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{25} \\), this becomes \\( 7m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nAgain, multiply both sides by the inverse of 7 modulo 25, which is 18: \\( m \\equiv 1 \\times 18 \\pmod{25} \\), so \\( m \\equiv 18 \\pmod{25} \\).\n\nThus, \\( m = 25q + 18 \\) for some integer \\( q \\), and \\( k = 16m - 1 = 16(25q + 18) - 1 = 400q + 288 - 1 = 400q + 287 \\).\n\nThe smallest \\( k \\) in this case is 287.\n\n### Finding the Smallest \\( k \\)\n\nNow, comparing the smallest \\( k \\) from each case:\n\n- Case 1: 400\n\n- Case 2: 399\n\n- Case 3: 112\n\n- Case 4: 287\n\nThe smallest among these is 112.\n\nBut wait, I need to verify if \\( k = 112 \\) indeed makes \\( \\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6} \\) divisible by 200.\n\nLet's calculate \\( \\frac{112 \\times 113 \\times 225}{6} \\).\n\nFirst, compute the numerator: \\( 112 \\times 113 = 12656 \\), then \\( 12656 \\times 225 = 2847600 \\).\n\nNow, divide by 6: \\( 2847600 / 6 = 474600 \\).\n\nNow, check if 474600 is divisible by 200. Divide 474600 by 200: \\( 474600 / 200 = 2373 \\), which is an integer. So, yes, it is divisible by 200.\n\nTherefore, \\( k = 112 \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nBut just to make sure there isn't a smaller \\( k \\), let's check the other cases.\n\nFrom Case 3, \\( k = 112 \\) is the smallest.\n\nFrom Case 4, \\( k = 287 \\), which is larger than 112.\n\nFrom Case 1 and 2, \\( k = 399 \\) and \\( k = 400 \\), both larger than 112.\n\nTherefore, the smallest \\( k \\) is 112.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]",
