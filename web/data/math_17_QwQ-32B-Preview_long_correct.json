First, no two consecutive digits are equal, and second, the last digit is a prime number. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an \\( n \\)-digit positive integer is. It's any number from \\( 10^{n-1} \\) to \\( 10^n - 1 \\), right? For example, if \\( n = 1 \\), it's from 1 to 9; if \\( n = 2 \\), from 10 to 99, and so on. But wait, actually, for \\( n = 1 \\), it's from 1 to 9, but for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), it's from \\( 10^{n-1} \\) to \\( 10^n - 1 \\), and the first digit can't be zero.\n\nNow, the two conditions:\n\n1. No two consecutive digits are equal.\n\n2. The last digit is a prime number.\n\nLet me consider the second condition first. What are the possible last digits? Prime digits between 0 and 9 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, the last digit must be one of these four numbers.\n\nOkay, so for any \\( n \\)-digit number satisfying both conditions, the last digit is either 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nNow, for the first condition, no two consecutive digits are equal. That means, in the entire number, no two adjacent digits are the same.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to think about building the number digit by digit, from left to right, and keeping track of the restrictions.\n\nLet's start with the first digit. Since it's an \\( n \\)-digit number, the first digit can't be zero. So, it can be from 1 to 9. But, there's no restriction from previous digits because it's the first one. However, I need to make sure that the first digit isn't equal to the second digit, and so on, but I'm building it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use recursion or some form of combinatorial counting.\n\nLet me consider the general case for any \\( n \\).\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n- The number is a single digit from 1 to 9.\n\n- The last digit must be prime: 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n- So, there are 4 such numbers.\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nFor \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n- The first digit can be from 1 to 9 (can't be 0).\n\n- The second digit can be from 0 to 9, but not equal to the first digit, and must be prime: 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nSo, for the first digit, 9 choices (1-9).\n\nFor the second digit, it must be one of 2, 3, 5, 7, and not equal to the first digit.\n\nWait, but the first digit could be one of these primes, so I need to consider if the first digit is a prime or not.\n\nActually, the first digit can be any from 1 to 9, and the second digit must be one of 2, 3, 5, 7, and not equal to the first digit.\n\nSo, number of choices for the first digit: 9.\n\nNumber of choices for the second digit: if the first digit is not a prime, then 4 choices (since it can't be equal to the first digit, but the first digit isn't prime, so all primes are possible except if it matches the first digit, but it doesn't).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nTotal number of 2-digit numbers where the last digit is prime and no two consecutive digits are equal.\n\nFirst digit: 1-9 (9 choices).\n\nSecond digit: must be one of 2, 3, 5, 7 (4 choices), and not equal to the first digit.\n\nSo, for each first digit, if it's not one of the primes, then all 4 primes are possible for the second digit, as long as it's not equal to the first digit. But since the first digit isn't prime, and the second digit is prime, they can't be equal anyway, because the first digit isn't prime. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if the first digit is 2, which is prime, then the second digit can't be 2. But wait, 2 is prime, so if the first digit is 2, the second digit can't be 2. If the first digit is 1, which isn't prime, the second digit can be 2, 3, 5, or 7, and none of them equal to 1, so all 4 are allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to split into cases based on whether the first digit is prime or not.\n\nCase 1: First digit is prime (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n- Number of choices for first digit: 4.\n\n- Second digit must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7) and not equal to the first digit.\n\n- So, for each of these, second digit has 3 choices (since it can't be equal to the first digit).\n\n- Therefore, for this case: 4 (first digit) * 3 (second digit) = 12 numbers.\n\nCase 2: First digit is not prime (1, 4, 6, 8, 9).\n\n- Number of choices for first digit: 5.\n\n- Second digit must be prime (2, 3, 5, 7) and not equal to the first digit.\n\n- Since the first digit isn't prime, it can't be equal to the second digit, which is prime.\n\n- Therefore, all 4 primes are allowed for the second digit.\n\n- So, for this case: 5 (first digit) * 4 (second digit) = 20 numbers.\n\nTotal for \\( n = 2 \\): 12 + 20 = 32 numbers.\n\nWait, but is there a better way to generalize this for any \\( n \\)?\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\): 4 numbers (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\nFor \\( n = 2 \\): 32 numbers.\n\nWait, 32 is 8 times 4. Wait, 8 is 10 (possible digits for second digit) minus 2 (since it can't be equal to the first digit, and the first digit can be from 1-9).\n\nWait, no, in the second digit, it can be from 0-9, but must be one of 2, 3, 5, 7, and not equal to the first digit.\n\nSo, it's not directly 10 minus 1.\n\nAnyway, perhaps thinking recursively is the way to go.\n\nLet me define \\( a_n \\) as the number of \\( n \\)-digit numbers satisfying both conditions.\n\nI need to find a recursive relation for \\( a_n \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of permutations with restrictions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the number of choices for each digit, given the previous digit.\n\nLet me try to generalize for any \\( n \\).\n\nFor an \\( n \\)-digit number:\n\n- The first digit can be from 1 to 9.\n\n- Each subsequent digit can be from 0 to 9, but not equal to the previous digit.\n\n- The last digit must be one of 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nSo, the number of such \\( n \\)-digit numbers can be found by considering the number of ways to choose the first \\( n-1 \\) digits with no two consecutive digits equal, and the last digit is one of the four primes.\n\nWait, but the last digit has to be a prime, and not equal to the second-to-last digit.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\n- The first \\( n-1 \\) digits form an \\( (n-1) \\)-digit number where no two consecutive digits are equal.\n\n- The last digit is one of 2, 3, 5, 7, and not equal to the second-to-last digit.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I can think in terms of recursive sequences.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- Let \\( b_n \\) be the number of \\( n \\)-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal.\n\n- Then, \\( a_n \\) is the number of such \\( n \\)-digit numbers where the last digit is a prime.\n\nBut actually, in \\( b_n \\), the last digit can be anything from 0 to 9, as long as it's not equal to the second-to-last digit.\n\nBut in \\( a_n \\), the last digit must be one of 2, 3, 5, 7, and not equal to the second-to-last digit.\n\nSo, perhaps \\( a_n \\) is a subset of \\( b_n \\) where the last digit is a prime.\n\nBut I need to find \\( a_n \\) directly.\n\nLet me try to find a recursive relation for \\( a_n \\).\n\nSuppose I know \\( a_{n-1} \\), the number of \\( (n-1) \\)-digit numbers satisfying the conditions.\n\nThen, to form an \\( n \\)-digit number, I need to add a new digit at the end, which must be a prime and not equal to the second-to-last digit.\n\nWait, but the second-to-last digit is the last digit of the \\( (n-1) \\)-digit number, which is a prime.\n\nSo, for \\( a_n \\), I need to consider the last digit of the \\( (n-1) \\)-digit number, which is a prime, and then choose the \\( n \\)-th digit as a prime different from the \\( (n-1) \\)-th digit.\n\nTherefore, for each \\( (n-1) \\)-digit number in \\( a_{n-1} \\), there are 3 choices for the \\( n \\)-th digit (since it must be a prime different from the previous digit).\n\nTherefore, \\( a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\).\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, but for \\( n = 2 \\), if \\( a_1 = 4 \\), then \\( a_2 = 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\), but earlier I calculated \\( a_2 = 32 \\) using a different approach. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the number of ways to choose the first digit more carefully.\n\nLet me re-examine this.\n\nIn the case where \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n- First digit: 1-9 (9 choices).\n\n- Second digit: must be one of 2, 3, 5, 7, and not equal to the first digit.\n\nSo, total \\( a_2 = 9 \\times 4 - x \\), where \\( x \\) is the number of cases where the first digit is equal to the second digit.\n\nWait, but the second digit is restricted to be one of 2, 3, 5, 7, and not equal to the first digit.\n\nSo, if the first digit is not a prime, then all 4 primes are allowed for the second digit.\n\nIf the first digit is a prime, then only 3 primes are allowed for the second digit (since it can't be equal to the first digit).\n\nSo, number of valid \\( n = 2 \\) numbers is:\n\n- If first digit is not prime (1, 4, 6, 8, 9): 5 choices, each with 4 options for second digit: 5 * 4 = 20.\n\n- If first digit is prime (2, 3, 5, 7): 4 choices, each with 3 options for second digit: 4 * 3 = 12.\n\n- Total: 20 + 12 = 32.\n\nSo, \\( a_2 = 32 \\).\n\nBut according to the recursive relation \\( a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), \\( a_2 \\) would be 12, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the recursive relation \\( a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\) is incorrect.\n\nWhere did I go wrong?\n\nI think the mistake is in assuming that for each \\( (n-1) \\)-digit number in \\( a_{n-1} \\), there are 3 choices for the \\( n \\)-th digit.\n\nBut actually, in \\( a_{n-1} \\), the last digit is a prime.\n\nSo, when appending the \\( n \\)-th digit, which must be a prime different from the \\( (n-1) \\)-th digit, there are indeed 3 choices.\n\nBut this only accounts for the sequences where the \\( (n-1) \\)-th digit is a prime, which it is, since \\( a_{n-1} \\) requires the last digit to be a prime.\n\nHowever, in the \\( n = 2 \\) case, \\( a_1 = 4 \\), and \\( a_2 = 12 \\) from the recursive relation, but earlier calculation gives \\( a_2 = 32 \\).\n\nWait, there must be something missing in this recursive approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the total number of \\( n \\)-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal, and last digit a prime.\n\nSo, first, the total number of \\( n \\)-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal.\n\nLet me denote \\( b_n \\) as the number of \\( n \\)-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal.\n\nThen, \\( b_n \\) can be calculated as follows:\n\n- First digit: 9 choices (1-9).\n\n- Each subsequent digit: 9 choices (0-9, except the previous digit).\n\nWait, no. Actually, for each subsequent digit, it can be from 0-9, except the previous digit, so 9 choices.\n\nTherefore, \\( b_n = 9 \\times 9^{n-1} = 9^n \\).\n\nWait, but this includes numbers where the last digit is any digit from 0-9, not necessarily a prime.\n\nBut I need the last digit to be a prime: 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find the total number of \\( n \\)-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal, and last digit is a prime.\n\nSo, let's think about constructing such a number.\n\n- The first digit is from 1-9.\n\n- Each subsequent digit is from 0-9, not equal to the previous digit.\n\n- The last digit is one of 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\nSo, to count this, I can consider the following:\n\n- For n = 1: only the digits 2, 3, 5, 7: 4 possibilities.\n\n- For n >= 2:\n\n- The first digit is from 1-9: 9 choices.\n\n- The second digit is from 0-9, not equal to the first: 9 choices.\n\n- The third digit is from 0-9, not equal to the second: 9 choices.\n\n- ...\n\n- The (n-1)-th digit is from 0-9, not equal to the (n-2)-th digit: 9 choices.\n\n- The n-th digit is from 2, 3, 5, 7, not equal to the (n-1)-th digit.\n\nWait, but the n-th digit must be one of 2, 3, 5, 7, and not equal to the (n-1)-th digit.\n\nSo, the number of choices for the n-th digit depends on what the (n-1)-th digit is.\n\nIf the (n-1)-th digit is not a prime, then the n-th digit can be any of the 4 primes.\n\nIf the (n-1)-th digit is a prime, then the n-th digit can be any of the 3 other primes.\n\nTherefore, to find \\( a_n \\), I need to consider the distribution of the (n-1)-th digit being a prime or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of states.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- \\( a_n \\): number of n-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal and last digit is a prime.\n\n- \\( b_n \\): number of n-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal and last digit is not a prime.\n\nThen, the total number of n-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal is \\( a_n + b_n \\).\n\nNow, for \\( n \\geq 2 \\):\n\n- To form an n-digit number with no two consecutive digits equal and last digit a prime, the (n-1)-th digit can be either a prime or not.\n\n- If the (n-1)-th digit is a prime, then the n-th digit must be a prime different from the (n-1)-th digit: 3 choices.\n\n- If the (n-1)-th digit is not a prime, then the n-th digit must be one of the 4 primes, and not equal to the (n-1)-th digit. Since the (n-1)-th digit is not a prime, it can't be equal to the n-th digit, which is a prime. Therefore, all 4 primes are allowed.\n\nTherefore, the recursion for \\( a_n \\) is:\n\n\\( a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1} + 4 \\times b_{n-1} \\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\( b_n \\):\n\n- The n-th digit is not a prime (0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9): 6 choices, but not equal to the (n-1)-th digit.\n\n- If the (n-1)-th digit is a prime, then the n-th digit can be any of the 6 non-primes, as long as it's not equal to the (n-1)-th digit. Since the (n-1)-th digit is a prime, and the n-th digit is not a prime, they can't be equal anyway. So, all 6 choices are allowed.\n\n- If the (n-1)-th digit is not a prime, then the n-th digit can be any of the 6 non-primes, except the (n-1)-th digit itself: 5 choices.\n\nWait, but in \\( b_n \\), the n-th digit is not a prime, and not equal to the (n-1)-th digit.\n\nSo, the recursion for \\( b_n \\) is:\n\n\\( b_n = 5 \\times b_{n-1} + 6 \\times a_{n-1} \\)\n\nWait, why 6 times \\( a_{n-1} \\)?\n\nBecause if the (n-1)-th digit is a prime (which is the case in \\( a_{n-1} \\)), then the n-th digit can be any of the 6 non-primes, and since the (n-1)-th digit is a prime, it's different from the n-th digit, which is a non-prime.\n\nTherefore, \\( b_n = 5 \\times b_{n-1} + 6 \\times a_{n-1} \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( a_n = 3 \\times a_{n-1} + 4 \\times b_{n-1} \\)\n\nNow, I need initial conditions.\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n- \\( a_1 = 4 \\) (digits 2, 3, 5, 7)\n\n- \\( b_1 = 5 \\) (digits 1, 4, 6, 8, 9)\n\nNow, I can use these recursions to find \\( a_n \\) for any \\( n \\).\n\nFor example, for \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\( a_2 = 3 \\times 4 + 4 \\times 5 = 12 + 20 = 32 \\)\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation.\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\( a_3 = 3 \\times a_2 + 4 \\times b_2 \\)\n\nBut I need \\( b_2 \\):\n\n\\( b_2 = 5 \\times b_1 + 6 \\times a_1 = 5 \\times 5 + 6 \\times 4 = 25 + 24 = 49 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( a_3 = 3 \\times 32 + 4 \\times 49 = 96 + 196 = 292 \\)\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n = 4 \\):\n\n\\( b_3 = 5 \\times b_2 + 6 \\times a_2 = 5 \\times 49 + 6 \\times 32 = 245 + 192 = 437 \\)\n\n\\( a_4 = 3 \\times a_3 + 4 \\times b_3 = 3 \\times 292 + 4 \\times 437 = 876 + 1748 = 2624 \\)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems to be a valid recursive approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for \\( a_n \\).\n\nTo find a closed-form formula, I can solve the recurrence relations.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\( a_n = 3 a_{n-1} + 4 b_{n-1} \\)\n\n\\( b_n = 6 a_{n-1} + 5 b_{n-1} \\)\n\nWith initial conditions \\( a_1 = 4 \\), \\( b_1 = 5 \\)\n\nAlternatively, since \\( a_n + b_n = \\) total number of n-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal, which is \\( 9 \\times 9^{n-1} = 9^n \\), for \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\nWait, no. Actually, for n-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal:\n\n- First digit: 9 choices (1-9)\n\n- Each subsequent digit: 9 choices (0-9 except the previous digit)\n\n- Therefore, total number is \\( 9 \\times 9^{n-1} = 9^n \\)\n\nBut in our case, \\( a_n + b_n \\) should equal this, because \\( a_n \\) and \\( b_n \\) are partitions of all n-digit numbers with no two consecutive digits equal.\n\nSo, \\( a_n + b_n = 9^n \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( b_n = 9^n - a_n \\)\n\nSubstituting into the recursion for \\( a_n \\):\n\n\\( a_n = 3 a_{n-1} + 4 b_{n-1} = 3 a_{n-1} + 4 (9^{n-1} - a_{n-1}) = 3 a_{n-1} + 4 \\times 9^{n-1} - 4 a_{n-1} = -a_{n-1} + 4 \\times 9^{n-1} \\)\n\nSo, \\( a_n = -a_{n-1} + 4 \\times 9^{n-1} \\)\n\nHmm, that's an interesting recursion.\n\nNow, I have a linear nonhomogeneous recursion:\n\n\\( a_n + a_{n-1} = 4 \\times 9^{n-1} \\)\n\nWith initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n\nI can solve this recursion.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\n\\( a_n + a_{n-1} = 0 \\)\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n\\( r + 1 = 0 \\) => \\( r = -1 \\)\n\nSo, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is:\n\n\\( a_n^{(h)} = c (-1)^n \\)\n\nNow, find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation.\n\nThe nonhomogeneous term is \\( 4 \\times 9^{n-1} \\), which is \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\times 9^n \\).\n\nSince 9 is not a root of the characteristic equation, I can assume a particular solution of the form:\n\n\\( a_n^{(p)} = k \\times 9^n \\)\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n\\( k \\times 9^n + k \\times 9^{n-1} = 4 \\times 9^{n-1} \\)\n\nFactor out \\( 9^{n-1} \\):\n\n\\( k \\times 9 \\times 9^{n-1} + k \\times 9^{n-1} = 4 \\times 9^{n-1} \\)\n\n\\( (9k + k) \\times 9^{n-1} = 4 \\times 9^{n-1} \\)\n\n\\( 10k = 4 \\) => \\( k = \\frac{2}{5} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( a_n^{(p)} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 9^n \\)\n\nNow, the general solution is:\n\n\\( a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = c (-1)^n + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 9^n \\)\n\nApply the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\):\n\n\\( 4 = c (-1)^1 + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 9^1 \\)\n\n\\( 4 = -c + \\frac{18}{5} \\)\n\n\\( c = \\frac{18}{5} - 4 = \\frac{18}{5} - \\frac{20}{5} = -\\frac{2}{5} \\)\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n\\( a_n = -\\frac{2}{5} (-1)^n + \\frac{2}{5} \\times 9^n \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( a_n = \\frac{2}{5} (9^n - (-1)^n) \\)\n\nSo, the number of n-digit positive integers satisfying both conditions is:\n\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{2}{5} (9^n - (-1)^n) \\]\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier calculations.\n\nFor \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\( a_1 = \\frac{2}{5} (9^1 - (-1)^1) = \\frac{2}{5} (9 + 1) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 4 \\)\n\nWhich matches.\n\nFor \\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\( a_2 = \\frac{2}{5} (9^2 - (-1)^2) = \\frac{2}{5} (81 - 1) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 80 = 32 \\)\n\nWhich matches.\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\( a_3 = \\frac{2}{5} (9^3 - (-1)^3) = \\frac{2}{5} (729 + 1) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 730 = 292 \\)\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation.\n\nFor \\( n = 4 \\):\n\n\\( a_4 = \\frac{2}{5} (9^4 - (-1)^4) = \\frac{2}{5} (6561 - 1) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 6560 = 2624 \\)\n\nWhich also matches.\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the number of n-digit positive integers that satisfy both conditions is:\n\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{2}{5} (9^n - (-1)^n) \\]\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as:\n\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 9^n - \\frac{2}{5} \\times (-1)^n \\]\n\nBut the first form is more compact.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a_n = \\dfrac{2}{5} \\left(9^n - (-1)^n \\right)} \\]",
