In each round, the player with the most tokens gives one token to each of the other players and also places one token in the discard pile. The game ends when some player runs out of tokens. Players $A$, $B$, and $C$ start with $15$, $14$, and $13$ tokens, respectively. How many rounds will there be in the game?\n\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\ } 36 \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\ } 37 \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\ } 38 \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\ } 39 \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\ } 40$\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\nLet's see. So, there's this game with three players: A, B, and C, who start with 15, 14, and 13 tokens respectively. Each round, the player with the most tokens gives one token to each of the other players and also discards one token. The game ends when one player runs out of tokens. I need to figure out how many rounds there will be in total.\n\nFirst, I should understand the dynamics of the game. Each round, the player with the most tokens is the one who has to give away tokens and discard one. So, that player loses 3 tokens in total: one to each of the other two players and one to the discard pile.\n\nThe other players receive one token each from the player with the most tokens, so their token counts increase by one each.\n\nI need to simulate this process round by round until one player's token count reaches zero.\n\nLet me start by listing the initial token counts:\n\n- A: 15\n\n- B: 14\n\n- C: 13\n\nAnd the discard pile starts at 0.\n\nIn each round, I need to determine who has the most tokens, have them give one to each of the other players and discard one.\n\nLet me consider the first round:\n\n- A has 15, B has 14, C has 13. A has the most tokens.\n\n- A gives 1 to B, 1 to C, and discards 1.\n\n- So, A loses 3 tokens: 15 - 3 = 12\n\n- B gains 1: 14 + 1 = 15\n\n- C gains 1: 13 + 1 = 14\n\n- Discard pile: 0 + 1 = 1\n\nNow, token counts after round 1:\n\n- A: 12\n\n- B: 15\n\n- C: 14\n\n- Discard: 1\n\nNext round:\n\n- B has the most with 15 tokens.\n\n- B gives 1 to A, 1 to C, and discards 1.\n\n- B loses 3: 15 - 3 = 12\n\n- A gains 1: 12 + 1 = 13\n\n- C gains 1: 14 + 1 = 15\n\n- Discard: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nToken counts after round 2:\n\n- A: 13\n\n- B: 12\n\n- C: 15\n\n- Discard: 2\n\nNext round:\n\n- C has the most with 15 tokens.\n\n- C gives 1 to A, 1 to B, and discards 1.\n\n- C loses 3: 15 -

So, the game ends after 37 rounds.\n\nWait a minute, but the answer options are 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. And according to my count, it's 37.\n\nBut maybe there's a more efficient way to calculate this without listing every single round.\n\nLet me think about the overall pattern here.\n\nEach round, the player with the most tokens gives away 3 tokens: 1 to each of the other players and 1 to the discard pile.\n\nSo, in each round, the total number of tokens decreases by 1, because 2 tokens are transferred between players, and 1 is discarded.\n\nWait, no. The total number of tokens decreases by 1 each round because one token is discarded, while the other two are just redistributed among the players.\n\nInitially, the total number of tokens is 15 + 14 + 13 = 42.\n\nEach round, the total tokens decrease by 1 due to the discard.\n\nSo, the game will end when the total tokens reach 0, but since one player running out of tokens ends the game, we need to find when one player's tokens reach 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the token counts.\n\nLet me look for a pattern or a cycle in the token counts.\n\nFrom the initial counts:\n\nRound 0: A=15, B=14, C=13\n\nRound 1: A=12, B=15, C=14\n\nRound 2: A=13, B=12, C=15\n\nRound 3: A=14, B=13, C=12\n\nRound 4: A=11, B=14, C=13\n\nRound 5: A=12, B=11, C=14\n\nRound 6: A=13, B=12, C=11\n\nRound 7: A=10, B=13, C=12\n\nRound 8: A=11, B=10, C=13\n\nRound 9: A=12, B=11, C=10\n\nRound 10: A=9, B=12, C=11\n\nRound 11: A=10, B=9, C=12\n\nRound 12: A=11, B=10, C=9\n\nRound 13: A=8, B=11, C=10\n\nRound 14: A=9, B=8, C=11\n\nRound 15: A=10, B=9, C=8\n\nRound 16: A=7, B=10, C=9\n\nRound 17: A=8, B=7, C=10\n\nRound 18: A=9, B=8, C=7\n\nRound 19: A=6, B=9, C=8\n\nRound 20: A=7, B=6, C=9\n\nRound 21: A=8, B=7, C=6\n\nRound 22: A=5, B=8, C=7\n\nRound 23: A=6, B=5, C=8\n\nRound 24: A=7, B=6, C=5\n\nRound 25: A=4, B=7, C=6\n\nRound 26: A=5, B=4, C=7\n\nRound 27: A=6, B=5, C=4\n\nRound 28: A=3, B=6, C=5\n\nRound 29: A=4, B=3, C=6\n\nRound 30: A=5, B=4, C=3\n\nRound 31: A=2, B=5, C=4\n\nRound 32: A=3, B=2, C=5\n\nRound 33: A=4, B=3, C=2\n\nRound 34: A=1, B=4, C=3\n\nRound 35: A=2, B=1, C=4\n\nRound 36: A=3, B=2, C=1\n\nRound 37: A=0, B=3, C=2\n\nSo, after 37 rounds, A has 0 tokens, and the game ends.\n\nTherefore, the number of rounds is 37.\n\nBut let's see if there's a mathematical formula or a shorter way to calculate this without listing all the rounds.\n\nLet me consider the total tokens and how they decrease.\n\nTotal initial tokens: 15 + 14 + 13 = 42\n\nEach round, one token is discarded, so after r rounds, the total tokens are 42 - r.\n\nThe game ends when one player's tokens reach 0.\n\nI need to find the smallest r such that 42 - r is less than or equal to the sum of the tokens of the other two players.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a cycle in the token counts every certain number of rounds.\n\nLooking back at the rounds I listed:\n\nRound 0: A=15, B=14, C=13\n\nRound 3: A=14, B=13, C=12\n\nRound 6: A=13, B=12, C=11\n\nRound 9: A=12, B=11, C=10\n\nRound 10: A=9, B=12, C=11\n\nRound 11: A=10, B=9, C=12\n\nRound 12: A=11, B=10, C=9\n\nRound 13: A=8, B=11, C=10\n\nRound 14: A=9, B=8, C=11\n\nRound 15: A=10, B=9, C=8\n\nRound 16: A=7, B=10, C=9\n\nRound 17: A=8, B=7, C=10\n\nRound 18: A=9, B=8, C=7\n\nRound 19: A=6, B=9, C=8\n\nRound 20: A=7, B=6, C=9\n\nRound 21: A=8, B=7, C=6\n\nRound 22: A=5, B=8, C=7\n\nRound 23: A=6, B=5, C=8\n\nRound 24: A=7, B=6, C=5\n\nRound 25: A=4, B=7, C=6\n\nRound 26: A=5, B=4, C=7\n\nRound 27: A=6, B=5, C=4\n\nRound 28: A=3, B=6, C=5\n\nRound 29: A=4, B=3, C=6\n\nRound 30: A=5, B=4, C=3\n\nRound 31: A=2, B=5, C=4\n\nRound 32: A=3, B=2, C=5\n\nRound 33: A=4, B=3, C=2\n\nRound 34: A=1, B=4, C=3\n\nRound 35: A=2, B=1, C=4\n\nRound 36: A=3, B=2, C=1\n\nRound 37: A=0, B=3, C=2\n\nIt seems that every 3 rounds, the token counts for A, B, and C decrease by 3, 3, and 3 respectively, but with some fluctuations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the token counts over time.\n\nLet me denote the token counts after r rounds as A(r), B(r), C(r).\n\nWe have the initial conditions:\n\nA(0) = 15\n\nB(0) = 14\n\nC(0) = 13\n\nAnd in each round, the player with the most tokens loses 3, and the other two gain 1 each.\n\nThis is a bit tricky to model directly because the player with the most tokens changes each round.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the differences between the token counts.\n\nLet me consider the differences between A and B, B and C, and C and A.\n\nInitially:\n\nA - B = 15 - 14 = 1\n\nB - C = 14 - 13 = 1\n\nC - A = 13 - 15 = -2\n\nAfter round 1:\n\nA=12, B=15, C=14\n\nA - B = 12 - 15 = -3\n\nB - C = 15 - 14 = 1\n\nC - A = 14 - 12 = 2\n\nAfter round 2:\n\nA=13, B=12, C=15\n\nA - B = 13 - 12 = 1\n\nB - C = 12 - 15 = -3\n\nC - A = 15 - 13 = 2\n\nAfter round 3:\n\nA=14, B=13, C=12\n\nA - B = 14 - 13 = 1\n\nB - C = 13 - 12 = 1\n\nC - A = 12 - 14 = -2\n\nSo, after 3 rounds, the differences are back to the initial differences.\n\nThis suggests a cycle every 3 rounds.\n\nWait, but looking back:\n\nRound 0: A=15, B=14, C=13\n\nRound 3: A=14, B=13, C=12\n\nRound 6: A=13, B=12, C=11\n\nRound 9: A=12, B=11, C=10\n\nAnd so on, decreasing by 1 every 3 rounds.\n\nWait, no, from round 0 to round 3:\n\nA decreases by 1 (15 to 14)\n\nB decreases by 1 (14 to 13)\n\nC decreases by 1 (13 to 12)\n\nSo, every 3 rounds, each player loses 1 token.\n\nSimilarly, from round 3 to round 6:\n\nA decreases by 1 (14 to 13)\n\nB decreases by 1 (13 to 12)\n\nC decreases by 1 (12 to 11)\n\nThis pattern seems consistent.\n\nSo, every 3 rounds, each player loses 1 token.\n\nTherefore, the total decrease per 3 rounds is 3 tokens (1 from each player).\n\nBut wait, actually, since each round one token is discarded, and there are 3 players, the total tokens decrease by 1 per round.\n\nSo, after r rounds, the total tokens are 42 - r.\n\nBut according to the cycle, every 3 rounds, the token counts for each player decrease by 1, which aligns with the total decrease of 3 tokens (1 from each player) over 3 rounds, but actually, the total decrease is 3 tokens over 3 rounds, which is 1 token per round, matching the discard.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nSo, if every 3 rounds, each player loses 1 token, then the token counts can be expressed in terms of the number of 3-round cycles.\n\nLet me define n as the number of 3-round cycles.\n\nThen, after n cycles (or 3n rounds), each player has:\n\nA(n) = 15 - n\n\nB(n) = 14 - n\n\nC(n) = 13 - n\n\nAnd the total tokens are 42 - 3n.\n\nThe game ends when one player's tokens reach 0.\n\nSo, we need to find the smallest n such that one of the players has 0 tokens.\n\nSet A(n) = 0:\n\n15 - n = 0 => n = 15\n\nSet B(n) = 0:\n\n14 - n = 0 => n = 14\n\nSet C(n) = 0:\n\n13 - n = 0 => n = 13\n\nSo, the smallest n is 13, when C reaches 0 tokens.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier counting, C reaches 1 first at round 36, and then in round 37, A reaches 0.\n\nWait, this contradicts the cyclic approach.\n\nIn the cyclic approach, after 13 cycles (39 rounds), the token counts would be:\n\nA(13) = 15 - 13 = 2\n\nB(13) = 14 - 13 = 1\n\nC(13) = 13 - 13 = 0\n\nWhich suggests the game ends at round 39.\n\nBut in the explicit counting, A reaches 0 at round 37.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the cyclic approach is not entirely accurate, perhaps because the player with the most tokens changes, affecting the dynamics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cycle breaks before completing 13 cycles.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the cyclic approach and the explicit counting, I'll trust the explicit counting, which shows the game ends at round 37.\n\nTherefore, the number of rounds is 37.",
