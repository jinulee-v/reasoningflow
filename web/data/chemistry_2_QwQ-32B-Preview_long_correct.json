Show the calculation and explain the observed effect on the value of Kc.\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\nAlright, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It\u2019s about how the equilibrium constant, Kc, changes when the temperature is increased for the reaction N2O4(g) \u21cc 2NO2(g). The temperature goes from 25\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C. I need to figure out what happens to Kc and explain it with calculations.\n\nFirst off, I remember that equilibrium constants are temperature-dependent. So, changing the temperature should affect Kc, but I need to understand whether it increases or decreases. I think it depends on whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic.\n\nLooking at the reaction, N2O4 decomposes into 2NO2. I believe this reaction is endothermic because, in many cases, decomposition reactions require heat. But I should confirm that. Let me see, N2O4 is dinitrogen tetroxide, and NO2 is nitrogen dioxide. I think this reaction absorbs heat, making it endothermic.\n\nIf it's endothermic, increasing the temperature should favor the forward reaction, producing more NO2. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if you increase the temperature of an endothermic reaction, the system will shift to absorb that heat, which means shifting towards the products. So, Kc should increase because the ratio of products to reactants increases.\n\nBut I need to show calculations. I think I need to use the van't Hoff equation, which relates the change in the equilibrium constant with temperature. The equation is:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -\u0394H/R * (1/T2 - 1/T1)\n\nWhere:\n\n\\- K1 and K2 are the equilibrium constants at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively.\n\n\\- \u0394H is the enthalpy change of the reaction.\n\n\\- R is the gas constant.\n\n\\- T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nI need to make sure all temperatures are in Kelvin. So, 25\u00b0C is 298 K, and 50\u00b0C is 323 K.\n\nI need the value of \u0394H for the reaction. I'm not sure what it is off the top of my head. Let me look it up. Okay, for N2O4 \u21cc 2NO2, the \u0394H\u00b0 is about +57.2 kJ/mol. The positive sign indicates it's endothermic.\n\nNow, plugging the values into the van't Hoff equation:\n\nln(K2/K1) = -(57200 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol\u00b7K) * (1/323 K - 1/298 K)\n\nFirst, calculate the difference in the reciprocals of the temperatures:\n\n1/323 - 1/298 = (298 - 323)/(323*298) = (-25)/(323*298) \u2248 -25/96454 \u2248 -0.0002593 K^-1\n\nNow, multiply by -\u0394H/R:\n\n-57200 / 8.314 \u2248 -6882.2\n\nThen, -6882.2 * (-0.0002593) \u2248 1.789\n\nSo, ln(K2/K1) \u2248 1.789\n\nTo find K2/K1, I need to exponentiate both sides:\n\nK2/K1 = e^(1.789) \u2248 e^1.789 \u2248 5.97\n\nSo, K2 \u2248 5.97 * K1\n\nThis means that when the temperature increases from 25\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C, the equilibrium constant Kc increases by a factor of about 6. So, Kc increases.\n\nThis makes sense with Le Chatelier's principle because for an endothermic reaction, increasing the temperature shifts the equilibrium towards the products, increasing Kc.\n\nI should also consider if there are any assumptions I'm making here. I'm assuming that \u0394H doesn't change significantly with temperature, which might not be perfectly accurate, but for this calculation, it's a reasonable approximation.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether the reaction is in the gas phase and if pressure changes are involved, but since volume isn't changing and we're only considering temperature, I think it's fine.\n\nSo, in conclusion, increasing the temperature from 25\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C increases the equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction N2O4(g) \u21cc 2NO2(g) because the reaction is endothermic, and the system responds by producing more NO2 to absorb the added heat.",
