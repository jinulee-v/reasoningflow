    "raw_text": "<QUESTION>\n\nA street has 20 houses on each side, for a total of 40 houses. The addresses on the south side of the street form an arithmetic sequence, as do the addresses on the north side of the street. On the south side, the addresses are 4, 10, 16, etc., and on the north side they are 3, 9, 15, etc. A sign painter paints house numbers on a house for $\\$1$ per digit. If he paints the appropriate house number once on each of these 40 houses, how many dollars does he collect?\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\nSo I've got this problem here about house numbers on a street with 20 houses on each side, making 40 houses in total. The south side houses form an arithmetic sequence starting with 4, 10, 16, and so on. The north side starts with 3, 9, 15, etc. A sign painter charges $1 per digit to paint the house numbers, and he paints each house number once. I need to find out how much he collects in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequences for both sides of the street.\n\nStarting with the south side:\n\nThe sequence is 4, 10, 16, ...\n\nLet me see, the common difference here is 10 - 4 = 6, and 16 - 10 = 6, so the common difference (d) is 6.\n\nThe first term (a1) is 4.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nSo, for the south side, the nth term is:\n\nan = 4 + (n - 1)*6\n\nSimilarly, for the north side:\n\nThe sequence is 3, 9, 15, ...\n\nCommon difference is 9 - 3 = 6, and 15 - 9 = 6, so d = 6.\n\nFirst term (a1) is 3.\n\nSo, nth term for north side is:\n\nan = 3 + (n - 1)*6\n\nNow, there are 20 houses on each side, so n ranges from 1 to 20.\n\nI need to list out all the house numbers for both sides and calculate the total cost based on the number of digits in each house number.\n\nLet me first list the south side house numbers:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 4 + 1*6 = 10\n\na3 = 4 + 2*6 = 16\n\na4 = 4 + 3*6 = 22\n\na5 = 4 + 4*6 = 28\n\na6 = 4 + 5*6 = 34\n\na7 = 4 + 6*6 = 40\n\na8 = 4 + 7*6 = 46\n\na9 = 4 + 8*6 = 52\n\na10 = 4 + 9*6 = 58\n\na11 = 4 + 10*6 = 64\n\na12 = 4 + 11*6 = 70\n\na13 = 4 + 12*6 = 76\n\na14 = 4 + 13*6 = 82\n\na15 = 4 + 14*6 = 88\n\na16 = 4 + 15*6 = 94\n\na17 = 4 + 16*6 = 100\n\na18 = 4 + 17*6 = 106\n\na19 = 4 + 18*6 = 112\n\na20 = 4 + 19*6 = 118\n\nSo, south side house numbers are: 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100, 106, 112, 118\n\nNow, north side house numbers:\n\na1 = 3\n\na2 = 3 + 1*6 = 9\n\na3 = 3 + 2*6 = 15\n\na4 = 3 + 3*6 = 21\n\na5 = 3 + 4*6 = 27\n\na6 = 3 + 5*6 = 33\n\na7 = 3 + 6*6 = 39\n\na8 = 3 + 7*6 = 45\n\na9 = 3 + 8*6 = 51\n\na10 = 3 + 9*6 = 57\n\na11 = 3 + 10*6 = 63\n\na12 = 3 + 11*6 = 69\n\na13 = 3 + 12*6 = 75\n\na14 = 3 + 13*6 = 81\n\na15 = 3 + 14*6 = 87\n\na16 = 3 + 15*6 = 93\n\na17 = 3 + 16*6 = 99\n\na18 = 3 + 17*6 = 105\n\na19 = 3 + 18*6 = 111\n\na20 = 3 + 19*6 = 117\n\nSo, north side house numbers are: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 117\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total cost of painting all these house numbers, with the painter charging $1 per digit.\n\nFirst, let's categorize the house numbers based on the number of digits:\n\n- 1-digit numbers: 3, 4, 9\n\n- 2-digit numbers: 10, 15, 16, 21, 22, 27, 28, 33, 34, 39, 40, 45, 46, 51, 52, 57, 58, 63, 64, 69, 70, 75, 76, 81, 82, 87, 88, 93, 94, 99\n\n- 3-digit numbers: 100, 105, 106, 111, 112, 117, 118\n\nLet's count how many of each:\n\n1-digit numbers:\n\n- South side: 4\n\n- North side: 3, 9\n\nSo, total 1-digit numbers: 3\n\n2-digit numbers:\n\nLooking at the lists:\n\nSouth side: 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100 (but 100 is 3-digit), so 15 numbers, but 1 is 3-digit, so 14 2-digit numbers.\n\nNorth side: 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99, 105 (but 105 is 3-digit), so 15 numbers, but 1 is 3-digit, so 14 2-digit numbers.\n\nTotal 2-digit numbers: 14 (south) + 14 (north) = 28\n\n3-digit numbers:\n\nSouth side: 100, 106, 112, 118 \u2192 4 numbers\n\nNorth side: 105, 111, 117 \u2192 3 numbers\n\nTotal 3-digit numbers: 4 + 3 = 7\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n\n- 1-digit numbers: 3 numbers \u00d7 1 digit each \u00d7 $1 per digit = $3\n\n- 2-digit numbers: 28 numbers \u00d7 2 digits each \u00d7 $1 per digit = 28 \u00d7 2 = $56\n\n- 3-digit numbers: 7 numbers \u00d7 3 digits each \u00d7 $1 per digit = 7 \u00d7 3 = $21\n\nTotal collection: $3 + $56 + $21 = $80\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"each of these 40 houses\", and I have 3 + 28 + 7 = 38 houses. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of 2-digit and 3-digit numbers.\n\nLet's double-check:\n\nSouth side: 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100, 106, 112, 118\n\nNumbers:\n\n- 1-digit: 4 \u2192 1 number\n\n- 2-digit: 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94 \u2192 15 numbers\n\n- 3-digit: 100, 106, 112, 118 \u2192 4 numbers\n\nNorth side: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 117\n\nNumbers:\n\n- 1-digit: 3, 9 \u2192 2 numbers\n\n- 2-digit: 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99 \u2192 15 numbers\n\n- 3-digit: 105, 111, 117 \u2192 3 numbers\n\nTotal:\n\n- 1-digit: 1 (south) + 2 (north) = 3\n\n- 2-digit: 15 (south) + 15 (north) = 30\n\n- 3-digit: 4 (south) + 3 (north) = 7\n\nTotal houses: 3 + 30 + 7 = 40, which matches.\n\nWait, earlier I had mistakenly counted south side 2-digit numbers as 14, but actually, it's 15.\n\nSo, correcting:\n\n- 1-digit: 3 numbers \u00d7 1 digit \u00d7 $1 = $3\n\n- 2-digit: 30 numbers \u00d7 2 digits \u00d7 $1 = $60\n\n- 3-digit: 7 numbers \u00d7 3 digits \u00d7 $1 = $21\n\nTotal collection: $3 + $60 + $21 = $84\n\nBut let's double-check the house numbers to ensure accuracy.\n\nSouth side:\n\n4 (1 digit)\n\n10,16,22,28,34,40,46,52,58,64,70,76,82,88,94: that's 15 numbers (10,16,22,28,34,40,46,52,58,64,70,76,82,88,94) \u2192 all 2-digit\n\n100,106,112,118: 4 numbers, 3-digit\n\nNorth side:\n\n3,9: 2 numbers, 1 digit each\n\n15,21,27,33,39,45,51,57,63,69,75,81,87,93,99: 15 numbers, 2-digit each\n\n105,111,117: 3 numbers, 3 digits each\n\nTotal:\n\n1-digit: 3\n\n2-digit: 15 (south) + 15 (north) = 30\n\n3-digit: 4 (south) + 3 (north) = 7\n\nTotal houses: 3 + 30 + 7 = 40\n\nTotal cost: 3*1 + 30*2 + 7*3 = 3 + 60 + 21 = 84\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that some numbers might have been miscounted in terms of digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequences are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should derive the sequences properly.\n\nGiven that both sequences are arithmetic with common difference 6.\n\nSouth side: first term 4, so terms are 4, 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, 52, 58, 64, 70, 76, 82, 88, 94, 100, 106, 112, 118\n\nNorth side: first term 3, so terms are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, 93, 99, 105, 111, 117\n\nYes, as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequences continue differently, but given that they are arithmetic with difference 6, and starting at 4 and 3 respectively, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequences are up to 20 terms each, but in reality, some terms might be missing if they exceed certain limits, but in this case, all 40 house numbers are included as per the sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the painter paints the numbers only once, meaning that if a number appears on both sides, but since the sequences are different, no overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that some houses might have the same number, but given the sequences, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the total number of digits painted across all house numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the sum of the house numbers, but the problem is about the number of digits painted, not the sum of the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is per house, not per digit, but the problem says \"paints house numbers on a house for $1 per digit.\"\n\nSo, it's clear that it's $1 per digit, and he paints each house number once.\n\nTherefore, total cost is the total number of digits across all 40 house numbers.\n\nFrom earlier, that's 3*1 + 30*2 + 7*3 = 3 + 60 + 21 = 84\n\nTherefore, the painter collects $84.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different answer, but based on this reasoning, $84 seems correct.",
