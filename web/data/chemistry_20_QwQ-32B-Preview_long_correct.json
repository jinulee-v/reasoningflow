        "question": "Calculate the enthalpy change for the isomerization of n-butane to iso-butane if the standard enthalpy of formation for n-butane is -125.7 kJ/mol and that for iso-butane is -147.4 kJ/mol. The isomerization reaction occurs at a constant pressure of 1 atm and at a temperature of 298 K.",
        "response": "Alright, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy change for the isomerization of n-butane to iso-butane. I'm a bit rusty on enthalpy changes, but I remember that it has to do with the heat involved in a reaction at constant pressure. Okay, the problem gives me the standard enthalpy of formation for both n-butane and iso-butane, which are -125.7 kJ/mol and -147.4 kJ/mol, respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what isomerization means. It's a process where one molecule is transformed into another molecule with the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of atoms, right? So, n-butane is a straight-chain alkane, and iso-butane is a branched-chain alkane. They have the same molecular formula, C4H10, but different structures.\n\nNow, the reaction occurs at constant pressure (1 atm) and at a temperature of 298 K. Since it's at constant pressure, enthalpy change should be the appropriate quantity to consider.\n\nI recall that the standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for n-butane and iso-butane, these values are given.\n\nTo find the enthalpy change for the isomerization reaction, I think I need to consider the difference in enthalpy between the products and reactants. In this case, the reactant is n-butane, and the product is iso-butane.\n\nSo, the enthalpy change for the reaction (\u0394H_rxn) should be the enthalpy of formation of the products minus the enthalpy of formation of the reactants.\n\nMathematically, \u0394H_rxn = \u03a3 \u0394H_f(products) - \u03a3 \u0394H_f(reactants)\n\nSince it's just one mole of n-butane converting to one mole of iso-butane, it should be straightforward.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u0394H_rxn = \u0394H_f(iso-butane) - \u0394H_f(n-butane)\n\n= (-147.4 kJ/mol) - (-125.7 kJ/mol)\n\n= -147.4 + 125.7\n\n= -21.7 kJ/mol\n\nWait, so the enthalpy change is -21.7 kJ/mol. That means the reaction is exothermic because the enthalpy decreases.\n\nBut let me double-check if I'm using the correct formula. I think I'm correct because for reactions, the enthalpy change is based on the difference in enthalpy between products and reactants.\n\nAlso, considering the units, everything is in kJ/mol, so that's consistent.\n\nI should also think about whether this makes sense chemically. Iso-butane is generally more stable than n-butane, so it should have a lower enthalpy of formation, which aligns with the values given (-147.4 vs. -125.7 kJ/mol). So, converting to a more stable form releases energy, hence the negative \u0394H.\n\nI don't think I need to consider temperature or pressure directly in this calculation because the enthalpy of formation values are already given under standard conditions, and the reaction is at constant pressure, which is already accounted for in enthalpy change.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that the enthalpy change for the isomerization of n-butane to iso-butane is -21.7 kJ/mol."
