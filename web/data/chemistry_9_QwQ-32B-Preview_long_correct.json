It asks me to calculate the standard electrode potential for the reaction: Zn(s) + Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + Cu(s). They also give me the standard electrode potentials for Zn\u00b2\u207a/Zn, which is -0.76V, and for Cu\u00b2\u207a/Cu, which is +0.34V.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what standard electrode potential means. From what I remember, it's the potential difference measured under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, and so on) for a redox reaction. In this case, it's about the reaction between zinc metal and copper ions.\n\nSo, the reaction is Zn(s) + Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + Cu(s). I need to figure out the standard cell potential for this reaction. I think I need to use the standard electrode potentials given for each half-reaction.\n\nWait, I recall that in electrochemistry, reactions are split into oxidation and reduction half-reactions. So, I should identify which species is being oxidized and which is being reduced here.\n\nZinc is going from Zn(s) to Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq), so it's losing electrons. That means it's being oxidized. Copper is going from Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) to Cu(s), so it's gaining electrons, meaning it's being reduced.\n\nSo, oxidation half-reaction: Zn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b\n\nReduction half-reaction: Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s)\n\nNow, I have the standard electrode potentials for these half-reactions. But I need to be careful about which one is the oxidation potential and which one is the reduction potential.\n\nI think the standard electrode potential given for Zn\u00b2\u207a/Zn is the reduction potential for Zn\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s), which is -0.76V. But since Zn is being oxidized here, I need to reverse this reaction and also reverse the sign of the potential.\n\nSimilarly, the standard electrode potential for Cu\u00b2\u207a/Cu is +0.34V, which corresponds to the reduction reaction Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s). Since this is the reduction half-reaction in our overall reaction, I can use this value directly.\n\nSo, to calculate the standard cell potential (E\u00b0 cell), I need to subtract the oxidation potential from the reduction potential.\n\nWait, actually, I think the formula is E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode - E\u00b0 anode.\n\nIn this case, the reduction is happening at the cathode, which is the Cu\u00b2\u207a/Cu couple, and the oxidation is happening at the anode, which is the Zn/Zn\u00b2\u207a couple.\n\nSo, E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode - E\u00b0 anode.\n\nGiven that E\u00b0 cathode is +0.34V (for Cu\u00b2\u207a/Cu) and E\u00b0 anode is -0.76V (for Zn\u00b2\u207a/Zn), but since it's oxidation, I need to use the oxidation potential, which would be the reverse of the reduction potential.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me recall: The standard electrode potential given is for the reduction reaction. If the reaction is being reversed (oxidized), then the sign of E\u00b0 should be reversed.\n\nSo, for Zn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b, which is oxidation, the potential would be the reverse of its reduction potential. Since the reduction potential for Zn\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s) is -0.76V, the oxidation potential for Zn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b would be +0.76V.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. I think I need to be careful here.\n\nLet me look it up quickly in my notes. Okay, standard electrode potential tables list reduction reactions and their potentials. If you want the oxidation potential, you reverse the reaction and reverse the sign of E\u00b0.\n\nSo, for Zn\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s), E\u00b0 = -0.76V.\n\nTherefore, Zn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b, E\u00b0 = +0.76V.\n\nSimilarly, for Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s), E\u00b0 = +0.34V.\n\nSo, in the cell reaction, Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s) is the reduction half-reaction (cathode), and Zn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b is the oxidation half-reaction (anode).\n\nThen, E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode - E\u00b0 anode = +0.34V - (+0.76V) = -0.42V.\n\nWait, but that gives a negative value, which would imply that the reaction is not spontaneous under standard conditions. But I know that zinc does oxidize copper in practice, so I must be making a mistake here.\n\nMaybe I got the signs wrong. Let me think again.\n\nThe standard cell potential should be E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode - E\u00b0 anode.\n\nCathode is reduction: Cu\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s), E\u00b0 = +0.34V.\n\nAnode is oxidation: Zn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b, E\u00b0 = +0.76V.\n\nSo, E\u00b0 cell = +0.34V - (+0.76V) = -0.42V.\n\nBut this suggests the reaction is non-spontaneous, which contradicts what I know about zinc displacing copper from its solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check the formula again.\n\nI think the correct formula is E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode - E\u00b0 anode, where E\u00b0 anode is the standard electrode potential for the anode as a reduction reaction. But since the anode is undergoing oxidation, I need to use the reverse of its reduction potential.\n\nSo, perhaps I should be using E\u00b0 anode for oxidation as +0.76V, but in the formula, it's subtracted as E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode - E\u00b0 anode.\n\nSo, E\u00b0 cell = +0.34V - (+0.76V) = -0.42V.\n\nBut again, this gives a negative value.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have misremembered the formula.\n\nLet me recall: E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode + E\u00b0 oxidation.\n\nWhere E\u00b0 oxidation is the standard potential for the oxidation half-reaction.\n\nIn this case, E\u00b0 oxidation for Zn is +0.76V, and E\u00b0 reduction for Cu is +0.34V.\n\nSo, E\u00b0 cell = +0.34V + (+0.76V) = +1.10V.\n\nThat makes more sense, as it's positive, indicating a spontaneous reaction.\n\nBut I'm confused now because different sources might present the formula differently.\n\nMaybe I should look up the correct formula for calculating standard cell potential.\n\nAfter checking, I find that the standard cell potential is calculated as E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode - E\u00b0 anode, where E\u00b0 anode is the standard potential for the anode as a reduction reaction.\n\nIn this case, the anode is Zn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b, which is the oxidation of Zn. The standard reduction potential for Zn\u00b2\u207a + 2e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s) is -0.76V, so the oxidation potential is +0.76V.\n\nTherefore, E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 cathode - E\u00b0 anode = +0.34V - (+0.76V) = -0.42V.\n\nBut this still doesn't make sense because the reaction should be spontaneous.\n\nI'm clearly making a mistake here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I should use the formula E\u00b0 cell = E\u00b0 reduction (cathode) - E\u00b0 reduction (anode), where the anode is written as a reduction reaction.\n\nGiven that, E\u00b0 cathode = +0.34V (Cu\u00b2\u207a/Cu), and E\u00b0 anode for Zn\u00b2\u207a/Zn is -0.76V.\n\nSo, E\u00b0 cell = +0.34V - (-0.76V) = +1.10V.\n\nThat seems correct, and it matches what I expect.\n\nI think I was confusing myself earlier by trying to reverse the potentials incorrectly.\n\nSo, the standard cell potential should be +1.10V.",
