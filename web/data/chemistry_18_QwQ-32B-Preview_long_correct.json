    "raw_text": "<QUESTION>\n\nCalculate the standard heat of formation (in kJ/mol) of water (H2O) given the following bond energies: \n\nH-H = 436 kJ/mol, O=O = 498 kJ/mol, H-O = 463 kJ/mol.\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\nAlright, so I have this problem to calculate the standard heat of formation of water using bond energies. Let's see, I need to find the \u0394Hf\u00b0 for H\u2082O. I have the bond energies given: H-H is 436 kJ/mol, O=O is 498 kJ/mol, and H-O is 463 kJ/mol.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the standard heat of formation is. It's the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For water, that would be forming H\u2082O from H\u2082 and O\u2082.\n\nSo, the reaction would be: H\u2082(g) + \u00bd O\u2082(g) \u2192 H\u2082O(l), and I need to find \u0394H for this reaction.\n\nNow, using bond energies, I can estimate the enthalpy change. The general approach is to calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds in the products. The difference between these two will give the enthalpy change of the reaction.\n\nSo, for the reactants: I have H\u2082 and O\u2082. H\u2082 has one H-H bond, and O\u2082 has one O=O bond.\n\nFor H\u2082: 1 mol of H-H bond, so energy to break it is 436 kJ/mol.\n\nFor O\u2082: 1 mol of O=O bond, so energy to break it is 498 kJ/mol.\n\nBut wait, the reaction has 1 mol of H\u2082 and \u00bd mol of O\u2082, so I need to adjust the bond energies accordingly.\n\nEnergy to break reactant bonds:\n\nH\u2082: 1 mol \u00d7 436 kJ/mol = 436 kJ\n\nO\u2082: \u00bd mol \u00d7 498 kJ/mol = 249 kJ\n\nTotal energy to break bonds in reactants: 436 + 249 = 685 kJ\n\nNow, for the products: H\u2082O has two H-O bonds.\n\nSo, for 1 mol of H\u2082O, it has 2 mol of H-O bonds.\n\nEnergy released by forming bonds in products:\n\n2 mol \u00d7 463 kJ/mol = 926 kJ\n\nNow, \u0394H = energy to break bonds - energy to form bonds\n\n\u0394H = 685 kJ - 926 kJ = -241 kJ\n\nSo, the standard heat of formation of water is -241 kJ/mol.\n\nWait, but I should double-check this. I remember that the standard heat of formation of water is around -286 kJ/mol, but using bond energies, I'm getting -241 kJ/mol. There might be some assumptions here.\n\nOh, I think bond energies are approximate values, and the actual \u0394Hf\u00b0 is more accurately determined experimentally. So, using bond energies gives an estimate, but not the exact value.\n\nStill, based on the given bond energies, -241 kJ/mol seems correct for this calculation.",
