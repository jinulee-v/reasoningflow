This looks like a sum of trigonometric functions with different frequencies. I need to show that there's at least one value of \\( x \\) that makes the entire expression equal to zero.\n\nFirst, I should consider the properties of trigonometric functions. I know that sine and cosine functions are continuous and periodic. Maybe I can use these properties to show that the sum must cross zero at least once.\n\nLet me think about the sum as a function of \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k \\sin kx + b_k \\cos kx) \\]\n\nI need to show that there exists some \\( x \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\nOne approach could be to evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at different points and see if it changes sign. If it does, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one root where \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\nBut to apply the Intermediate Value Theorem, I need to show that \\( f(x) \\) takes on both positive and negative values, or that it's zero at some point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) over one period. Since all the terms are periodic with periods that are fractions of \\( 2\\pi \\), the entire function \\( f(x) \\) is periodic with period \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\nLet me consider integrating \\( f(x) \\) over one period. If the integral is zero, that might tell me something about the average value of the function.\n\nThe integral of \\( f(x) \\) from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k \\sin kx + b_k \\cos kx) \\, dx \\]\n\nSince integration is linear, this becomes:\n\n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left( a_k \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin kx \\, dx + b_k \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos kx \\, dx \\right) \\]\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin kx \\, dx = 0 \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos kx \\, dx = 0 \\]\n\nfor any integer \\( k \\geq 1 \\). Therefore, the integral of \\( f(x) \\) over one period is zero.\n\nThis tells me that the average value of \\( f(x) \\) over one period is zero. But does that mean it must cross zero at least once?\n\nWell, if \\( f(x) \\) is always positive or always negative, its integral would not be zero. So for the integral to be zero, \\( f(x) \\) must take on both positive and negative values, or be zero everywhere.\n\nBut I need to show that there's at least one root, meaning \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for at least one \\( x \\).\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is zero everywhere, then obviously there are infinitely many roots. So, I can assume that \\( f(x) \\) is not identically zero.\n\nIn that case, since the integral of \\( f(x) \\) over one period is zero, and \\( f(x) \\) is continuous (as it's a sum of continuous functions), it must take on both positive and negative values within that period.\n\nBy the Intermediate Value Theorem, if a continuous function takes on both positive and negative values, then it must be zero at least once in between.\n\nTherefore, there exists at least one \\( x \\) in the interval \\( [0, 2\\pi) \\) such that \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\nWait a minute, is \\( f(x) \\) always continuous? Yes, since it's a sum of continuous functions.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that \\( f(x) \\) is not always zero. But the problem states \"for any values of \\( a_1, b_1, \\ldots, a_n, b_n \\)\", which includes the case where all coefficients are zero, but also cases where they are not.\n\nIf all coefficients are zero, then \\( f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), which trivially has infinitely many roots.\n\nIf at least one coefficient is non-zero, then \\( f(x) \\) is not identically zero, and the integral over one period being zero implies that \\( f(x) \\) takes on both positive and negative values or crosses zero.\n\nHence, in any case, there is at least one root.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to consider \\( f(x) \\) as a Fourier series. The given sum is similar to a Fourier series expansion of a periodic function.\n\nIn Fourier analysis, a non-trivial trigonometric polynomial (i.e., not all coefficients are zero) has only a finite number of roots unless it's identically zero.\n\nBut in our case, since we're not assuming that the coefficients correspond to a function with infinitely many roots, this might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values of \\( x \\) to show that \\( f(x) \\) changes sign.\n\nFor example, evaluate \\( f(0) \\) and \\( f(\\pi) \\), and see if they have opposite signs.\n\nAt \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ f(0) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k \\sin 0 + b_k \\cos 0) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k \\]\n\nAt \\( x = \\pi \\):\n\n\\[ f(\\pi) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (a_k \\sin k\\pi + b_k \\cos k\\pi) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} [a_k \\cdot 0 + b_k (-1)^k] = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k (-1)^k \\]\n\nNow, if \\( f(0) \\) and \\( f(\\pi) \\) have opposite signs, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one root between 0 and \\( \\pi \\).\n\nHowever, it's possible that \\( f(0) \\) and \\( f(\\pi) \\) are both zero, or have the same sign, depending on the coefficients \\( b_k \\).\n\nSo, this might not always work.\n\nMaybe I can consider other points, like \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\), and see if I can find points where \\( f(x) \\) has opposite signs.\n\nAt \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ f\\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\left( a_k \\sin \\left( k \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) + b_k \\cos \\left( k \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\right) \\]\n\nThis depends on whether \\( k \\) is even or odd. For example, \\( \\sin \\left( k \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\) is 1, 0, -1, 0, etc., depending on \\( k \\), and similarly for cosine.\n\nThis seems complicated, and it might not lead me directly to a conclusion about the signs of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the function over its period and use properties of continuous functions.\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is continuous and its integral over one period is zero, and assuming it's not identically zero, it must take on both positive and negative values or be zero at some points.\n\nTherefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one point where \\( f(x) = 0 \\).\n\nThis seems like a solid argument.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the maximum and minimum values of \\( f(x) \\). Since \\( f(x) \\) is continuous on a closed interval, it attains its maximum and minimum. If both are zero, then \\( f(x) \\) is identically zero. Otherwise, the maximum is positive and the minimum is negative, or vice versa, and again, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root.\n\nThis reinforces the earlier conclusion.\n\nI think this is sufficient to prove that there's at least one root.",
