        "question": "What is the equilibrium constant for the electrochemical cell where the half-cell reaction at the anode is Zn(s) \u2192 Zn2+(aq) + 2e- and the half-cell reaction at the cathode is Cu2+(aq) + 2e- \u2192 Cu(s)? Given that the standard reduction potential of Cu2+/Cu is +0.34 V and that of Zn2+/Zn is -0.76 V at 298 K.",
        "response": "Alright, so I've got this electrochemistry problem here. I need to find the equilibrium constant for a cell made up of zinc and copper electrodes. The reactions are given:\n\nAt the anode: Zn(s) \u2192 Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b\n\nAt the cathode: Cu\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Cu(s)\n\nAnd I'm given the standard reduction potentials: Cu\u00b2\u207a/Cu is +0.34 V and Zn\u00b2\u207a/Zn is -0.76 V, all at 298 K.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what equilibrium constant means in this context. Equilibrium constant, K, is a measure of the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium. In electrochemistry, it's related to the cell potential.\n\nI remember that the relationship between the standard cell potential (E\u00b0 cell) and the equilibrium constant (K) is given by the Nernst equation, but there's a specific formula that directly relates them. I think it's the equation that involves the gas constant and temperature.\n\nWait, I think it's the formula: \u0394G\u00b0 = -RT ln K, and also \u0394G\u00b0 = -nFE\u00b0 cell, where \u0394G\u00b0 is the standard Gibbs free energy change, R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant, and E\u00b0 cell is the standard cell potential.\n\nSo, if I set these two expressions for \u0394G\u00b0 equal to each other:\n\n-nFE\u00b0 cell = -RT ln K\n\nI can simplify this to:\n\nE\u00b0 cell = (RT/nF) ln K\n\nBut I need to solve for K, so I'll rearrange it:\n\nln K = (nFE\u00b0 cell)/(RT)\n\nAnd then:\n\nK = e^((nFE\u00b0 cell)/(RT))\n\nOkay, so I need to find E\u00b0 cell first.\n\nE\u00b0 cell is calculated as E\u00b0 cathode minus E\u00b0 anode.\n\nGiven that:\n\nE\u00b0 cathode = E\u00b0 for Cu\u00b2\u207a/Cu = +0.34 V\n\nE\u00b0 anode = E\u00b0 for Zn\u00b2\u207a/Zn = -0.76 V\n\nSo, E\u00b0 cell = 0.34 V - (-0.76 V) = 0.34 V + 0.76 V = 1.10 V\n\nNow, I need to find n, the number of electrons transferred. From the half-reactions, both involve 2 electrons, so n = 2.\n\nTemperature is given as 298 K.\n\nR is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K.\n\nF is Faraday's constant, which is 96485 C/mol.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\nK = e^((2 * 96485 C/mol * 1.10 V)/(8.314 J/mol\u00b7K * 298 K))\n\nWait a second, the units here need to match. Joules and Coulombs and Volts\u2014let me make sure the units are consistent.\n\nVolts times Coulombs give Joules, so the numerator is in J/mol, and the denominator is also in J/mol\u00b7K multiplied by K, which is J/mol. So the units cancel out, and it's dimensionless, which is good because the exponent should be dimensionless.\n\nLet me calculate the exponent:\n\n(2 * 96485 * 1.10)/(8.314 * 298)\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator: 2 * 96485 = 192,970; 192,970 * 1.10 = 212,267.\n\nDenominator: 8.314 * 298 \u2248 2,477.572.\n\nSo, 212,267 / 2,477.572 \u2248 85.73\n\nTherefore, ln K \u2248 85.73\n\nTo find K, I need to exponentiate both sides:\n\nK = e^85.73\n\nThat's a huge number! I know that e^2 \u2248 7.389, e^10 is about 22,026, and it grows exponentially from there.\n\nBut 85 is way beyond that. I might need to express it in terms of exponents.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relation that K = e^(\u0394G\u00b0 / (-RT))\n\nBut I think I've done it correctly.\n\nWait, let me double-check the formula.\n\nI recall that sometimes the formula is written as:\n\n\u0394G\u00b0 = -RT ln K, and \u0394G\u00b0 = -nFE\u00b0 cell.\n\nSo setting them equal: -nFE\u00b0 cell = -RT ln K\n\nWhich simplifies to nFE\u00b0 cell = RT ln K\n\nThen ln K = (nFE\u00b0 cell)/(RT)\n\nYes, that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, some sources might use \u0394G\u00b0 = -RT ln K, and \u0394G\u00b0 = -nFE\u00b0 cell, so:\n\n-nFE\u00b0 cell = -RT ln K\n\nWhich again leads to ln K = (nFE\u00b0 cell)/(RT)\n\nSo I think the formula is correct.\n\nBut 85.73 seems extremely large. Is there a better way to express this?\n\nMaybe I should calculate it in terms of powers of 10.\n\nI know that e^(85.73) = 10^(85.73 * ln e / ln 10) = 10^(85.73 / 2.302585093) \u2248 10^(37.25)\n\nSo K \u2248 10^37.25\n\nThat\u2019s a very large equilibrium constant, indicating that the reaction strongly favors products at equilibrium.\n\nBut does that make sense for the Zn/Cu cell?\n\nZinc is a more active metal than copper, so it should readily oxidize to Zn\u00b2\u207a while reducing Cu\u00b2\u207a to Cu, meaning the reaction should indeed strongly favor product formation.\n\nSo, despite the large number, it seems chemically reasonable.\n\nBut perhaps I should check the calculation again for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me recalculate the exponent:\n\nn = 2\n\nF = 96485 C/mol\n\nE\u00b0 cell = 1.10 V\n\nR = 8.314 J/mol\u00b7K\n\nT = 298 K\n\nSo, numerator: 2 * 96485 * 1.10 = 2 * 96485 = 192,970; 192,970 * 1.10 = 212,267 J/mol\n\nDenominator: 8.314 * 298 = 2,477.572 J/mol\n\nSo, 212,267 / 2,477.572 \u2248 85.73\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a different form of the equation that uses ln K = (nFE\u00b0)/(RT)\n\nBut I think that's what I've done.\n\nAnother way to check is to use the relationship between E\u00b0 cell and K:\n\nE\u00b0 cell = (RT/nF) ln K\n\nThen, solving for K:\n\nK = e^(nFE\u00b0 cell / RT)\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nI think the calculation is correct.\n\nSo, the equilibrium constant is e^(85.73), which is approximately 10^37.25.\n\nI can write it as K \u2248 10^37\n\nThat should be acceptable."
