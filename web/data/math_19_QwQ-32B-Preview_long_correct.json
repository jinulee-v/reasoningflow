At first glance, this seems a bit tricky because tangent functions aren't always easy to multiply directly, especially with angles that aren't common like \\(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\).\n\nI recall that there are some identities involving products of tangents with angles that are fractions of \\(\\pi\\), but I'm not sure exactly how to apply them here. Maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that relates the tangents of these specific angles.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the tangent function. Tangent is periodic with period \\(\\pi\\), and it's an odd function, meaning \\(\\tan(-x) = -\\tan(x)\\). Also, I know that \\(\\tan(x + y)\\) has a specific identity, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the seven roots of unity. Since the angles are multiples of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\), which is related to dividing the circle into seven equal parts, maybe there's a connection to complex numbers or roots of unity.\n\nLet me recall that the seventh roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \\(z^7 = 1\\), which are \\(z = e^{2\\pi i k / 7}\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\). Maybe I can relate these to the tangent function.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of multiple-angle identities or identities involving sums of tangents. Maybe there's a way to express this product in terms of such identities.\n\nLet me try to find a relationship involving \\(\\tan(7x)\\). If I set \\(x = \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\), then \\(7x = \\pi\\), and \\(\\tan(\\pi) = 0\\). So, \\(\\tan(7x) = 0\\). Maybe I can expand \\(\\tan(7x)\\) in terms of \\(\\tan(x)\\) and see if that leads me anywhere.\n\nI know that \\(\\tan(2x) = \\frac{2\\tan(x)}{1 - \\tan^2(x)}\\), and similarly, \\(\\tan(3x)\\) can be expressed using the triple angle formula. But extending that to seven angles seems complicated.\n\nPerhaps there's a better approach. I've come across identities involving the product of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. Maybe there's a formula for that.\n\nLet me try to search my memory for such a formula. I seem to recall that for certain angles, the product of tangents can be simplified using symmetry or other trigonometric identities.\n\nAnother thought: since the angles add up to \\(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\), which is \\(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\), maybe there's a co-function identity or something similar that I can use.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the identity that \\(\\tan(\\pi - x) = -\\tan(x)\\). So, \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\right) = -\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right)\\), \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{7}\\right) = -\\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)\\), and \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{7}\\right) = -\\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)\\).\n\nInteresting. So, the tangent function has a certain symmetry around \\(\\pi/2\\). Maybe I can use this to pair up angles and simplify the product.\n\nBut in this case, I only have \\(\\tan(\\pi/7)\\), \\(\\tan(2\\pi/7)\\), and \\(\\tan(3\\pi/7)\\). Maybe I can relate this product to the product of all seven tangents and then simplify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the equation satisfied by \\(\\tan(x)\\) where \\(x = \\frac{k\\pi}{7}\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\).\n\nWait, I recall that for \\(n\\) being an integer, the equation relating to \\(\\tan(nx)\\) can be expressed in terms of \\(\\tan(x)\\), and the roots of that equation are related to the angles \\(x = \\frac{k\\pi}{n}\\).\n\nSpecifically, for \\(n = 7\\), which is odd, there might be a specific polynomial whose roots are related to \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{7}\\right)\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, 3\\).\n\nLet me try to find that polynomial. I know that for \\(n = 3\\), there's a relationship like \\(\\tan(3x) = \\frac{3\\tan(x) - \\tan^3(x)}{1 - 3\\tan^2(x)}\\), and setting \\(\\tan(3x) = 0\\) gives the roots \\(x = \\frac{k\\pi}{3}\\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\(n = 7\\), \\(\\tan(7x) = 0\\) when \\(x = \\frac{k\\pi}{7}\\) for integer \\(k\\).\n\nSo, the equation \\(\\tan(7x) = 0\\) has roots at \\(x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{7}, \\frac{2\\pi}{7}, \\frac{3\\pi}{7}, \\frac{4\\pi}{7}, \\frac{5\\pi}{7}, \\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\tan(7x)\\) can be expressed in terms of \\(\\tan(x)\\) using the multiple-angle formula. Maybe I can derive a polynomial equation in terms of \\(t = \\tan(x)\\).\n\nLet me attempt to expand \\(\\tan(7x)\\) in terms of \\(t = \\tan(x)\\).\n\nI know that:\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan(2x) = \\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\n\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan(4x) = \\frac{2\\tan(2x)}{1 - \\tan^2(2x)} = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}}{1 - \\left( \\frac{2t}{1 - t^2} \\right)^2} = \\frac{4t/(1 - t^2)}{(1 - t^2)^2 - 4t^2)/(1 - t^2)^2} = \\frac{4t}{(1 - t^2) - 4t^2/(1 - t^2)} = \\text{this seems messy}\n\n\\]\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to expand \\(\\tan(7x)\\).\n\nAlternatively, I can use the general formula for \\(\\tan(nx)\\) in terms of \\(\\tan(x)\\), but I don't remember it off the top of my head.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that \\(\\tan(7x) = \\tan(x + 6x)\\), and use the addition formula for tangent.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan(7x) = \\tan(x + 6x) = \\frac{\\tan(x) + \\tan(6x)}{1 - \\tan(x)\\tan(6x)}\n\n\\]\n\nBut then I need to express \\(\\tan(6x)\\) in terms of \\(\\tan(x)\\), which again seems recursive and messy.\n\nThis approach isn't seeming very promising. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me consider the symmetry of the tangent function. Since \\(\\tan(x)\\) is an odd function, and the angles are symmetrically placed around \\(\\pi/2\\), perhaps there's a way to pair the terms.\n\nWait, but in this problem, I only have \\(\\tan(\\pi/7)\\), \\(\\tan(2\\pi/7)\\), and \\(\\tan(3\\pi/7)\\), which are all positive since \\(\\pi/7\\), \\(2\\pi/7\\), and \\(3\\pi/7\\) are in the first quadrant.\n\nMaybe I can relate this product to the imaginary parts of some complex numbers or something, but that seems too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps use the identity for the product of tangents in an arithmetic progression. I think there's an identity for the product \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\tan\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}\\right)\\) for odd \\(n\\), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for \\(n = 7\\), which is odd, there might be a known product formula.\n\nAfter a quick search in my mind, I recall that for odd \\(n\\), the product \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{n}\\right)\\) and similar products for cosine and tangent have known values.\n\nSpecifically, for the tangent function, there might be a product formula like \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\tan\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{2n}\\right) = \\sqrt{2n}\\), but I'm not sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the reflection formula or other properties of the tangent function.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the equation \\(\\tan(7x) = 0\\), which has roots at \\(x = 0, \\frac{\\pi}{7}, \\frac{2\\pi}{7}, \\frac{3\\pi}{7}, \\frac{4\\pi}{7}, \\frac{5\\pi}{7}, \\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\tan(7x) = 0\\), we can write \\(7x = k\\pi\\) for integer \\(k\\), so \\(x = \\frac{k\\pi}{7}\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\tan(7x)\\) can be expressed as a rational function in terms of \\(\\tan(x)\\), but the algebra is quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use complex exponentials to express the tangent function and then find the product.\n\nRecall that \\(\\tan(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\), and using Euler's formula, \\(\\sin(x) = \\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}\\) and \\(\\cos(x) = \\frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\tan(x) = \\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{i(e^{ix} + e^{-ix})}\\).\n\nBut multiplying these together for multiple angles seems complicated.\n\nMaybe there's a better way. Let's consider that the product \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)\\) might be related to the roots of a specific polynomial.\n\nIf I can find a polynomial whose roots are \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{7}\\right)\\) for \\(k = 1, 2, 3\\), then I can find the product from the constant term and leading coefficient.\n\nBut again, constructing such a polynomial seems non-trivial.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the fact that \\(\\tan(3\\pi/7)\\), \\(\\tan(2\\pi/7)\\), and \\(\\tan(\\pi/7)\\) are related through some recurrence or identity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the identity that relates the sum and product of tangents for angles adding up to \\(\\pi\\).\n\nI recall that for three angles \\(a + b + c = \\pi\\), there is an identity: \\(\\tan(a) + \\tan(b) + \\tan(c) = \\tan(a)\\tan(b)\\tan(c)\\).\n\nBut in this case, \\(\\frac{\\pi}{7} + \\frac{2\\pi}{7} + \\frac{3\\pi}{7} = \\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\), which is not equal to \\(\\pi\\), so that identity doesn't directly apply.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a similar identity for angles adding up to \\(\\pi\\), and I can adjust it accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \\(\\tan(a + b + c)\\).\n\nThe formula for \\(\\tan(a + b + c)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan(a + b + c) = \\frac{\\tan a + \\tan b + \\tan c - \\tan a \\tan b \\tan c}{1 - (\\tan a \\tan b + \\tan a \\tan c + \\tan b \\tan c)}\n\n\\]\n\nIn this case, \\(a + b + c = \\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\), so \\(\\tan(a + b + c) = \\tan\\left(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\right) = -\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right)\\).\n\nBut this seems complicated to use directly to find the product \\(\\tan(a) \\tan(b) \\tan(c)\\).\n\nMaybe I need to consider a different approach altogether.\n\nLet me think about the Chebyshev polynomials. Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, \\(T_n(x)\\), are related to \\(\\cos(nx)\\), and of the second kind, \\(U_n(x)\\), are related to \\(\\sin(nx)\\). Maybe I can use these to relate to the tangent function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the identity \\(\\tan(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\) and try to express the product in terms of sines and cosines.\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right)} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right)} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)}\n\n\\]\n\nMaybe I can combine these fractions:\n\n\\[\n\n= \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)}\n\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to find expressions for the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nI recall that there are product-to-sum identities for sines and cosines. Maybe I can use those to simplify the numerator and the denominator.\n\nFirst, let's consider the numerator: \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)\\).\n\nI know that \\(\\sin(a) \\sin(b) = \\frac{1}{2} [\\cos(a - b) - \\cos(a + b)]\\), but extending this to three angles is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the product of sines of multiple angles.\n\nLet me think about the identity for \\(\\sin(a) \\sin(b) \\sin(c)\\). I'm not sure if there's a direct formula for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the product of sines can be related to the imaginary part of a complex exponential product, but that seems too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the relationship between the sines of these angles and the roots of unity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for known values of these products for angles that are fractions of \\(\\pi\\).\n\nAfter thinking about it, I recall that there is a known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.\n\nSpecifically, for the product \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\cdots \\sin\\left(\\frac{(n-1)\\pi}{n}\\right)\\), there is a formula involving \\(n\\).\n\nBut in this case, I only have three terms, not all six non-trivial terms for \\(n = 7\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can relate this to the expression for \\(\\sin(3x)\\) or something similar.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the triple angle formula for tangent. I know that \\(\\tan(3x) = \\frac{3\\tan(x) - \\tan^3(x)}{1 - 3\\tan^2(x)}\\).\n\nBut in this problem, the angles are \\(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\), \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\), and \\(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\), which don't directly relate through a triple angle formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the sum of these angles. Their sum is \\(\\frac{6\\pi}{7}\\), which is \\(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\), but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the identity for \\(\\tan(a + b + c)\\) again, but this time, set \\(a = \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\), \\(b = \\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\), and \\(c = \\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\), and relate it to \\(\\tan(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{7}) = -\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right)\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7} + \\frac{2\\pi}{7} + \\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right) = \\tan\\left(\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) = -\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right)\n\n\\]\n\nAnd using the formula for \\(\\tan(a + b + c)\\):\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan(a + b + c) = \\frac{\\tan a + \\tan b + \\tan c - \\tan a \\tan b \\tan c}{1 - (\\tan a \\tan b + \\tan a \\tan c + \\tan b \\tan c)}\n\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to \\(-\\tan a\\), where \\(a = \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\n\\frac{\\tan a + \\tan b + \\tan c - \\tan a \\tan b \\tan c}{1 - (\\tan a \\tan b + \\tan a \\tan c + \\tan b \\tan c)} = -\\tan a\n\n\\]\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe I can solve for \\(\\tan a \\tan b \\tan c\\).\n\nLet me denote \\(t_a = \\tan a\\), \\(t_b = \\tan b\\), and \\(t_c = \\tan c\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\n\\frac{t_a + t_b + t_c - t_a t_b t_c}{1 - (t_a t_b + t_a t_c + t_b t_c)} = -t_a\n\n\\]\n\nNow, I can cross-multiply to solve for \\(t_a t_b t_c\\):\n\n\\[\n\nt_a + t_b + t_c - t_a t_b t_c = -t_a \\left(1 - (t_a t_b + t_a t_c + t_b t_c)\\right)\n\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n\nt_a + t_b + t_c - t_a t_b t_c = -t_a + t_a^2 t_b + t_a^2 t_c + t_a t_b t_c\n\n\\]\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n\nt_a + t_b + t_c - t_a t_b t_c + t_a - t_a^2 t_b - t_a^2 t_c - t_a t_b t_c = 0\n\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n\n2 t_a + t_b + t_c - 2 t_a t_b t_c - t_a^2 t_b - t_a^2 t_c = 0\n\n\\]\n\nThis seems too messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nLet me consider that \\(b = 2a\\) and \\(c = 3a\\), since \\(b = 2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\) and \\(c = 3 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\).  Maybe that simplifies things.\n\nSo, \\(t_b = \\tan(2a) = \\frac{2 t_a}{1 - t_a^2}\\), and \\(t_c = \\tan(3a) = \\frac{3 t_a - t_a^3}{1 - 3 t_a^2}\\).\n\nSubstituting these into the product \\(t_a t_b t_c\\):\n\n\\[\n\nt_a \\cdot \\frac{2 t_a}{1 - t_a^2} \\cdot \\frac{3 t_a - t_a^3}{1 - 3 t_a^2} = \\text{?}\n\n\\]\n\nThis looks complicated, but maybe I can simplify it step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify \\(t_b\\):\n\n\\[\n\nt_b = \\frac{2 t_a}{1 - t_a^2}\n\n\\]\n\nThen, \\(t_c = \\frac{3 t_a - t_a^3}{1 - 3 t_a^2}\\)\n\nNow, the product:\n\n\\[\n\nt_a \\cdot \\frac{2 t_a}{1 - t_a^2} \\cdot \\frac{3 t_a - t_a^3}{1 - 3 t_a^2} = \\frac{2 t_a^2 (3 t_a - t_a^3)}{(1 - t_a^2)(1 - 3 t_a^2)}\n\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n\n2 t_a^2 (3 t_a - t_a^3) = 6 t_a^3 - 2 t_a^5\n\n\\]\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\[\n\n(1 - t_a^2)(1 - 3 t_a^2) = 1 - 3 t_a^2 - t_a^2 + 3 t_a^4 = 1 - 4 t_a^2 + 3 t_a^4\n\n\\]\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n\\[\n\n\\frac{6 t_a^3 - 2 t_a^5}{3 t_a^4 - 4 t_a^2 + 1}\n\n\\]\n\nThis still seems too complicated to work with directly. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nLet me consider that \\(a = \\frac{\\pi}{7}\\), and the angles are multiples of \\(a\\). Perhaps I can look for a polynomial satisfied by \\(\\tan(a)\\), and then find the product from the roots of that polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the identity involving the sum of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression.\n\nI recall that for angles in arithmetic progression, there are sum formulas, but I'm not sure about product formulas.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps use logarithms to turn the product into a sum. So, \\(\\ln(\\tan a) + \\ln(\\tan b) + \\ln(\\tan c)\\), but I don't see how that helps in finding the actual product.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the reciprocal identity. Since \\(\\tan(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cot(x)}\\), perhaps expressing the product in terms of cotangents would help.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan a \\tan b \\tan c = \\frac{1}{\\cot a \\cot b \\cot c}\n\n\\]\n\nBut I don't know if that simplifies anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the identity that relates the product of tangents to the tangent of the sum of the angles,  but I don't recall such an identity.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe I should look for a known result or formula for this specific product.\n\nAfter some research in my mind, I recall that for \\(n\\) being an odd integer, the product \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right) \\cdots \\tan\\left(\\frac{(n-1)\\pi}{2n}\\right)\\) can be expressed in a closed form.\n\nSpecifically, for \\(n = 7\\), which is odd, the product \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)\\) is equal to \\(\\sqrt{7}\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nI seem to remember that for \\(n = 7\\), this product is related to the square root of 7. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's equal to \\(\\sqrt{7}\\), or maybe it's \\(\\sqrt{7}/7\\), or something similar. I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the identity:\n\n\\[\n\n\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right) = \\sqrt{7} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)}{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)}\n\n\\]\n\nBut this seems like a circular argument.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the reflection formula for the gamma function, but that might be overkill for this problem.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should accept that this product doesn't have a simple closed-form expression and leave it as is.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking to compute it, so there must be a way to find its exact value.\n\nAfter some more thought, I recall that the product \\(\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{7}\\right) \\tan\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{7}\\right)\\) is equal to \\(\\sqrt{7}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\sqrt{7}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\sqrt{7}} \\]",
