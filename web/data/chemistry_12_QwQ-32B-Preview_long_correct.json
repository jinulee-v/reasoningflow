The mass of the activated carbon sample is 0.25 g. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation can be used to determine the specific surface area.\n\n<RESPONSE>\n\nAlright, I've got this problem here about finding the specific surface area of activated carbon using the BET equation. I've heard about BET in my chemistry class, but I'm not entirely sure how to apply it. Let's see...\n\nSo, the problem gives me that 2.5 mL of nitrogen gas is adsorbed at 77 K and 1 atm pressure, and the mass of the activated carbon sample is 0.25 g. I need to find the specific surface area.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the BET equation is. From what I remember, BET is used to determine the surface area of a material based on gas adsorption data. It's pretty important in materials science for figuring out things like how much surface area is available for reactions or storage.\n\nI think the BET equation involves some constants and maybe some gas laws. I should look up the exact form of the BET equation to be sure. Let me see... Okay, the BET equation is:\n\n( P / (V * (P0 - P)) ) = (C * Vm * P0) / ( (Vm - V) * RT )\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simplified version for specific surface area calculations.\n\nI remember that specific surface area (SSA) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSSA = (V * N * A) / (W)\n\nWhere:\n\n\\- V is the volume of gas adsorbed\n\n\\- N is Avogadro's number\n\n\\- A is the cross-sectional area of a gas molecule\n\n\\- W is the mass of the adsorbent\n\nDoes that sound right? I think A for nitrogen at 77 K is a known value.\n\nLet me confirm the units. V is in mL, W is in grams, and A should be in square angstroms or something like that.\n\nI need to make sure all the units are consistent. Maybe I should convert mL to liters or cubic meters. Wait, no, since A is usually given in square angstroms and N is in per mole, I might need to adjust accordingly.\n\nAlso, I should check if there's a specific value for A when using nitrogen at 77 K. I think it's around 16.2 angstrom squared per molecule.\n\nLet me plug in the values I have:\n\nV = 2.5 mL\n\nW = 0.25 g\n\nA = 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2 per N2 molecule\n\nN = 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol\n\nWait, I need to make sure about the value of A. Let me double-check that. Yes, for nitrogen at 77 K, A is approximately 16.2 angstrom squared per molecule.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\nSSA = (V * N * A) / W\n\nBut I need to ensure that V is in liters to match the units of A and N. Actually, no, A is in angstrom squared, and V is in mL, so I need to convert everything to compatible units.\n\nLet me see, 1 mL is 1 cm\u00b3, and 1 cm\u00b3 is 10^24 \u00c5\u00b3. Wait, that seems too large. Maybe I should keep V in cm\u00b3 and A in \u00c5\u00b2.\n\nActually, I think there's a standard formula for SSA using BET, which might already account for the units.\n\nLet me look it up again. Oh, here it is:\n\nSSA = (0.607 * V * A) / W\n\nWhere:\n\n\\- 0.607 is a constant that accounts for the units and temperature\n\n\\- V is the volume of nitrogen adsorbed at monolayer coverage (cm\u00b3/g)\n\n\\- A is the cross-sectional area of nitrogen molecule (16.2 \u00c5\u00b2)\n\n\\- W is the mass of the adsorbent (g)\n\nWait, but in this formula, V should be in cm\u00b3(STP)/g. Is that right?\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the standard BET formula for SSA:\n\nSSA = (N * A * V) / (W * V_m)\n\nWhere:\n\n\\- N is Avogadro's number\n\n\\- A is the cross-sectional area of the adsorbed molecule\n\n\\- V is the volume of gas adsorbed at monolayer coverage\n\n\\- W is the mass of the adsorbent\n\n\\- V_m is the molar volume of gas at the adsorption temperature and pressure\n\nI need to make sure I have all these values.\n\nGiven that the nitrogen volume is 2.5 mL at 1 atm and 77 K, I need to find V, the volume adsorbed at monolayer coverage.\n\nWait, is 2.5 mL already the volume at monolayer coverage? Or is it the total volume adsorbed?\n\nI think in BET analysis, you usually have to plot the adsorption isotherm and find the volume at monolayer coverage, but in this problem, maybe it's given directly.\n\nAssuming V is 2.5 mL, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the volume to cm\u00b3 because the standard units for SSA are m\u00b2/g.\n\n1 mL = 1 cm\u00b3, so V = 2.5 cm\u00b3.\n\nA = 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2 per N2 molecule.\n\nN = 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol.\n\nW = 0.25 g.\n\nV_m, the molar volume of nitrogen at STP is 22.4 L/mol, but since it's at 77 K and 1 atm, I need to check if it's different.\n\nWait, at 77 K and 1 atm, what is the molar volume of nitrogen?\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.\n\nR = 0.0821 L\u00b7atm/mol\u00b7K.\n\nT = 77 K.\n\nn = PV / RT.\n\nBut actually, I need V_m, which is V/n.\n\nSo V_m = RT / P.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nR = 0.0821 L\u00b7atm/mol\u00b7K\n\nT = 77 K\n\nP = 1 atm\n\nV_m = (0.0821 * 77) / 1 = 6.3217 L/mol\n\nSo V_m = 6.3217 L/mol = 6321.7 cm\u00b3/mol\n\nNow, plugging into the SSA formula:\n\nSSA = (N * A * V) / (W * V_m)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nSSA = (6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol * 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2/molecule * 2.5 cm\u00b3) / (0.25 g * 6321.7 cm\u00b3/mol)\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n6.022 x 10^23 * 16.2 = 9.752 x 10^24 \u00c5\u00b2/mol\n\n9.752 x 10^24 * 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 2.438 x 10^25 \u00c5\u00b2\u00b7cm\u00b3/mol\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. I think I'm mixing units here.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nN * A = 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol * 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2/molecule = 9.752 x 10^24 \u00c5\u00b2/mol\n\nThen, N * A * V = 9.752 x 10^24 \u00c5\u00b2/mol * 2.5 cm\u00b3\n\nBut I need to relate cm\u00b3 to mol. Since V_m = 6321.7 cm\u00b3/mol, 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 / 6321.7 = 0.000395 mol.\n\nSo N * A * V = 9.752 x 10^24 \u00c5\u00b2/mol * 0.000395 mol = 3.86 x 10^21 \u00c5\u00b2\n\nNow, denominator: W * V_m = 0.25 g * 6321.7 cm\u00b3/mol\n\nBut I need to relate this to \u00c5\u00b2. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nI think I need to convert \u00c5\u00b2 to m\u00b2.\n\n1 \u00c5 = 1 x 10^-10 m, so 1 \u00c5\u00b2 = 1 x 10^-20 m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, 3.86 x 10^21 \u00c5\u00b2 = 3.86 x 10^21 * 10^-20 m\u00b2 = 38.6 m\u00b2\n\nThen, SSA = 38.6 m\u00b2 / 0.25 g = 154.4 m\u00b2/g\n\nWait, that seems too high for activated carbon. I thought typical values are around 1000 m\u00b2/g.\n\nDid I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, V_m at 77 K and 1 atm is 6.3217 L/mol or 6321.7 cm\u00b3/mol.\n\nN * A = 6.022 x 10^23 * 16.2 = 9.752 x 10^24 \u00c5\u00b2/mol\n\nN * A * V = 9.752 x 10^24 \u00c5\u00b2/mol * 2.5 cm\u00b3\n\nBut 2.5 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 / 6321.7 mol = 0.000395 mol\n\nSo N * A * V = 9.752 x 10^24 * 0.000395 = 3.86 x 10^21 \u00c5\u00b2\n\nConvert to m\u00b2: 3.86 x 10^21 * 10^-20 = 38.6 m\u00b2\n\nThen SSA = 38.6 m\u00b2 / 0.25 g = 154.4 m\u00b2/g\n\nBut as I thought, activated carbons typically have much higher surface areas, often in the range of 1000-3000 m\u00b2/g.\n\nMaybe I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nLet me look up the standard BET formula to make sure.\n\nI found that the specific surface area can be calculated using:\n\nSSA = (0.607 * V * A) / W\n\nWhere:\n\n\\- V is the volume of nitrogen gas adsorbed at monolayer coverage (cm\u00b3/g)\n\n\\- A is the cross-sectional area of nitrogen molecule (16.2 \u00c5\u00b2)\n\n\\- W is the mass of adsorbent (g)\n\n\\- 0.607 is a constant that includes temperature and gas constants\n\nGiven that, let's try this formula.\n\nV = 2.5 mL / 0.25 g = 10 cm\u00b3/g\n\nSSA = (0.607 * 10 cm\u00b3/g * 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2) / 1\n\nSSA = (0.607 * 10 * 16.2) \u00c5\u00b2/cm\u00b3/g\n\nWait, units aren't matching up. I think I need to include the conversion factor from cm\u00b3 to \u00c5\u00b3.\n\nActually, I think the correct formula is:\n\nSSA (m\u00b2/g) = (0.607 * V (cm\u00b3/g) * A (\u00c5\u00b2)) / (1 x 10^18)\n\nWhere 1 x 10^18 is to convert \u00c5\u00b2/cm\u00b3 to m\u00b2/g.\n\nSo,\n\nSSA = (0.607 * 10 * 16.2) / 1 x 10^18\n\nSSA = (0.607 * 162) / 1 x 10^18\n\nSSA = 98.434 / 1 x 10^18\n\nWait, that gives an extremely small number, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nMaybe I should use the formula:\n\nSSA = (N * A * V) / (W * V_m)\n\nWith:\n\nN = 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol\n\nA = 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2/molecule\n\nV = 2.5 cm\u00b3\n\nW = 0.25 g\n\nV_m = 6321.7 cm\u00b3/mol\n\nSo,\n\nSSA = (6.022 x 10^23 * 16.2 * 2.5) / (0.25 * 6321.7)\n\nFirst, calculate numerator:\n\n6.022 x 10^23 * 16.2 = 9.752 x 10^24\n\n9.752 x 10^24 * 2.5 = 2.438 x 10^25\n\nDenominator:\n\n0.25 * 6321.7 = 1580.425\n\nSo,\n\nSSA = 2.438 x 10^25 / 1580.425 = 1.543 x 10^22\n\nWait, that's in \u00c5\u00b2/g. To convert to m\u00b2/g:\n\n1 m\u00b2 = 1 x 10^20 \u00c5\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nSSA = 1.543 x 10^22 / 1 x 10^20 = 154.3 m\u00b2/g\n\nAgain, I get around 154 m\u00b2/g, but I expected higher for activated carbon.\n\nMaybe the volume adsorbed is not at monolayer coverage. Perhaps I need to use the BET equation more thoroughly.\n\nThe full BET equation is:\n\nP / (V (P0 - P)) = (C - 1) / (V_m C) + (1 / (V_m C)) * (P / P0)\n\nWhere:\n\n\\- P is the equilibrium pressure\n\n\\- P0 is the saturation pressure\n\n\\- V is the volume adsorbed at monolayer coverage\n\n\\- C is the BET constant related to the energy of adsorption\n\nBut in this problem, I don't have data for multiple pressures; I only have one point.\n\nSo, maybe I need to assume that the given volume is at monolayer coverage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the volume adsorbed is not just for one layer.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look up a standard BET surface area calculation example to guide me.\n\nAfter some research, I found that the specific surface area can be calculated using:\n\nSSA = (V_m * N_A * A) / (W * V)\n\nWhere:\n\n\\- V_m is the molar volume of gas\n\n\\- N_A is Avogadro's number\n\n\\- A is the cross-sectional area of the adsorbed molecule\n\n\\- W is the mass of the adsorbent\n\n\\- V is the volume of gas adsorbed at monolayer coverage\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nV_m = 22.4 L/mol at STP, but at 77 K and 1 atm, it's 6.3217 L/mol\n\nN_A = 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol\n\nA = 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2/molecule\n\nW = 0.25 g\n\nV = 2.5 cm\u00b3\n\nSo,\n\nSSA = (6.3217 L/mol * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol * 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2/molecule) / (0.25 g * 2.5 cm\u00b3)\n\nWait, units are still off. I need to make sure all units are compatible.\n\nI think I need to convert L to cm\u00b3 and \u00c5\u00b2 to m\u00b2.\n\n1 L = 1000 cm\u00b3\n\n1 \u00c5\u00b2 = 1 x 10^-20 m\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nSSA = (6.3217 x 1000 cm\u00b3/mol * 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol * 16.2 x 10^-20 m\u00b2/molecule) / (0.25 g * 2.5 cm\u00b3)\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n6.3217 x 1000 = 6321.7 cm\u00b3/mol\n\n6321.7 * 6.022 x 10^23 = 3.805 x 10^27 cm\u00b3\u00b7molecules/mol\u00b2\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. I think I'm mixing units again.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a standard BET equation for SSA.\n\nI found a formula:\n\nSSA = (0.607 * V * A) / W\n\nWhere:\n\n\\- V is the volume of nitrogen adsorbed at monolayer coverage (cm\u00b3/g)\n\n\\- A is the cross-sectional area of nitrogen molecule (16.2 \u00c5\u00b2)\n\n\\- W is the mass of the adsorbent (g)\n\n\\- 0.607 is a constant that includes temperature and gas constants\n\nSo,\n\nV = 2.5 cm\u00b3 / 0.25 g = 10 cm\u00b3/g\n\nSSA = (0.607 * 10 * 16.2) / 1 x 10^18\n\nWait, no, the units need to be adjusted.\n\nActually, I think the correct formula should be:\n\nSSA = (0.607 * V * A) / W\n\nWith V in cm\u00b3(STP)/g, A in \u00c5\u00b2, and W in g.\n\nSo,\n\nSSA = (0.607 * 10 * 16.2) / 1 x 10^18\n\nSSA = (0.607 * 162) / 1 x 10^18\n\nSSA = 98.434 / 1 x 10^18\n\nAgain, this gives an unrealistically small number.\n\nI'm clearly missing something here. Maybe the volume should be in cm\u00b3(STP)/g, but I have the volume at 77 K.\n\nI need to convert the volume from 77 K to STP.\n\nUsing the ideal gas law:\n\nV1/T1 = V2/T2\n\nWhere:\n\nV1 = 2.5 cm\u00b3 at 77 K\n\nT1 = 77 K\n\nT2 = 273 K (STP temperature)\n\nSo,\n\nV2 = V1 * T2 / T1 = 2.5 * 273 / 77 \u2248 9.0 cm\u00b3 at STP\n\nThen, V = 9.0 cm\u00b3 / 0.25 g = 36 cm\u00b3(STP)/g\n\nNow, SSA = (0.607 * 36 * 16.2) / 1 x 10^18\n\nSSA = (0.607 * 583.2) / 1 x 10^18\n\nSSA = 354.0624 / 1 x 10^18\n\nStill, that's too small.\n\nI think I need to correct the units properly.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSSA (m\u00b2/g) = (N * A * V) / (W * V_m)\n\nWith:\n\nN = 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mol\n\nA = 16.2 \u00c5\u00b2/molecule = 16.2 x 10^-20 m\u00b2/molecule\n\nV = 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 2.5 x 10^-6 m\u00b3\n\nW = 0.25 g\n\nV_m = 6.3217 L/mol = 0.0063217 m\u00b3/mol\n\nSo,\n\nSSA = (6.022 x 10^23 * 16.2 x 10^-20 * 2.5 x 10^-6) / (0.25 * 0.0063217)\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n6.022 x 10^23 * 16.2 x 10^-20 = 9.752 x 10^4 m\u00b2/mol\n\n9.752 x 10^4 * 2.5 x 10^-6 = 0.2438 m\u00b2/mol\n\nDenominator:\n\n0.25 * 0.0063217 = 0.001580425 m\u00b3/mol\n\nSSA = 0.2438 / 0.001580425 \u2248 154 m\u00b2/g\n\nAgain, I get around 154 m\u00b2/g, but I believe activated carbons have much higher surface areas. Maybe I need to check the value of V_m or other constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the volume adsorbed at monolayer coverage is not directly given, and I need to use the BET equation to find it.\n\nGiven that I only have one data point, it's challenging to apply the full BET equation, which usually requires a range of pressure data.\n\nMaybe the problem assumes that the given volume is for monolayer coverage, and I can use a simplified formula.\n\nLet me try using the formula:\n\nSSA = (V * N_A * A) / (W * thickness_of_monolayer)\n\nAssuming the thickness is related to the gas volume.\n\nBut I'm not sure about this approach.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the consistent result around 154 m\u00b2/g, even if it seems low, I'll go with that.",
