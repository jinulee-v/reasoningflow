        "question": "A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r^2 from the origin, i.e. the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r^2. The field has non-zero component only along  the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the field, \u2207.f inside the volume of a sphere of radius R centred at the origin. Here, \u2207 and f both are implied as vectors. Which answer below is the most appropriate one for the answer of the integral?\nA. 1\nB. 0\nC. 4 \u03c0\nD. 4/3 \u03c0 R",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The field is radial and falls off as 1/r\u00b2. Hmm, let's start by recalling some vector calculus here. \n\nFirst, the divergence theorem comes to mind. It states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. Mathematically, that's \u222b(\u2207\u00b7f) dV = \u222ef\u00b7dA over the surface. Maybe I can use this theorem to simplify the problem instead of computing the divergence directly and integrating it?\n\nGiven that the field is radial and has magnitude 1/r\u00b2, in spherical coordinates, the field can be written as f(r) = (1/r\u00b2) * \\hat{r}, right? Because it's only along the radial direction. So, f(r) = \\hat{r}/r\u00b2. \n\nNow, if I remember correctly, the divergence of such a radial vector field in spherical coordinates is given by \u2207\u00b7f = (1/r\u00b2) d/dr [r\u00b2 f_r]. Let me verify that. Yes, the general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field is indeed (1/r\u00b2) times the derivative of (r\u00b2 f_r) with respect to r. \n\nSo substituting f_r = 1/r\u00b2 into that formula: \u2207\u00b7f = (1/r\u00b2) d/dr [r\u00b2 * (1/r\u00b2)] = (1/r\u00b2) d/dr [1] = 0. Wait, that's zero? So the divergence of the field is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? But if that's the case, then the volume integral of the divergence would be zero? But that contradicts my intuition because if I use the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface at radius R would be f(R) * surface area. Let's check that.\n\nUsing the divergence theorem: \u222b(\u2207\u00b7f) dV = \u222ef\u00b7dA. The right-hand side is the flux through the sphere of radius R. The field at radius R is f(R) = 1/R\u00b2 in the radial direction. The surface element dA is R\u00b2 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 \\hat{r}, so f\u00b7dA = (1/R\u00b2)(R\u00b2 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6) = sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6. Integrating that over the sphere: \u222b\u2080\u00b2\u03c0 \u222b\u2080^\u03c0 sin\u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 = 2\u03c0 * [ -cos\u03b8 ]\u2080^\u03c0 = 2\u03c0 * (1 - (-1)) = 4\u03c0. \n\nSo according to the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence over the volume is equal to 4\u03c0. But earlier, when computing \u2207\u00b7f, I found it to be zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. That suggests that the divergence is actually a delta function at the origin. Because if the integral over the volume is 4\u03c0, but \u2207\u00b7f is zero everywhere except the origin, then \u2207\u00b7f must be 4\u03c0 \u03b4\u00b3(r). Therefore, integrating \u2207\u00b7f over the volume would pick up the contribution from the origin, which is 4\u03c0. \n\nBut wait, the problem says to evaluate the volume integral inside a sphere of radius R. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then regardless of R (as long as the origin is inside the sphere, which it is), the integral should be 4\u03c0. So the answer should be C, 4\u03c0. \n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose I didn't use the divergence theorem and tried to compute the divergence directly. If \u2207\u00b7f = 0 everywhere except at the origin, but integrating over the volume gives 4\u03c0, that implies that the divergence has a delta function at the origin. So \u2207\u00b7( \\hat{r}/r\u00b2 ) = 4\u03c0 \u03b4\u00b3(r). I think that's a standard result in electromagnetism for the electric field of a point charge, where the divergence of E = k Q / r\u00b2 \\hat{r} is 4\u03c0 k Q \u03b4\u00b3(r). So yes, in this case, since the field is 1/r\u00b2 \\hat{r}, the divergence would be 4\u03c0 \u03b4\u00b3(r), and integrating over any volume containing the origin would give 4\u03c0. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C, 4\u03c0. Let me check the options again: A. 1, B. 0, C. 4\u03c0, D. 4/3 \u03c0 R. So C is the correct answer. \n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any chance that the divergence isn't a delta function here. Suppose we naively compute the divergence as we did before, getting zero everywhere except at r=0, but maybe the integral is still zero? But according to the divergence theorem, it's 4\u03c0. So there's a contradiction unless we account for the singularity at the origin. Therefore, the divergence isn't just zero everywhere; it has a delta function at the origin. \n\nAlternatively, if someone ignores the singularity and just integrates zero over the volume, they might think the answer is zero, which is option B. But that's incorrect because the origin contributes a delta function. So the correct answer is C. \n\nAnother way to see it: The flux through the surface is 4\u03c0, so by divergence theorem, the integral of divergence is 4\u03c0. Therefore, answer C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}"
