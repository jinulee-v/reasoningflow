        "question": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from an interior point I to each of the faces, where all those distances are equal. The answer needs to be in the form m\u221an / p, and then I have to find m + n + p. Alright, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the tetrahedron has edges AB, CD, AC, BD, BC, AD with lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), sqrt(89) respectively. That's interesting because the edges are paired: AB and CD are equal, AC and BD are equal, BC and AD are equal. That symmetry might be useful. Maybe the tetrahedron has some kind of symmetry that I can exploit?\n\nThe point I is inside the tetrahedron such that its distance to each of the four faces is equal. That point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, right? In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces and is the center of the inscribed sphere (inradius). So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.\n\nTo find the inradius, I recall that for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the total surface area S. So, r = 3V / S. Therefore, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.\n\nFirst, let me compute the surface area. Each face is a triangle. Since the edges are paired, maybe the faces are congruent in some way?\n\nLet me list all the faces:\n\n1. Face ABC: edges AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)\n2. Face ABD: edges AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)\n3. Face ACD: edges AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)\n4. Face BCD: edges BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80)\n\nHmm, so each face has the same set of edge lengths: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles! That's a key insight. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, the surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.\n\nTherefore, first, I need to compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me compute that area using Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter of triangle ABC:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nHmm, but Heron's formula would require squaring these terms, which might get messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way? Let me see if the triangle is right-angled?\n\nCheck if (sqrt(41))\u00b2 + (sqrt(80))\u00b2 = (sqrt(89))\u00b2 ?\n\nCompute 41 + 80 = 121, and 89 is 89. 121 \u2260 89, so that's not a right triangle. How about sqrt(41)^2 + sqrt(89)^2 vs sqrt(80)^2? 41 + 89 = 130 vs 80, nope. Similarly sqrt(80)^2 + sqrt(89)^2 is way bigger. So not a right triangle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinates can help here? Since the edges have these specific lengths, perhaps we can assign coordinates to the vertices such that calculations are easier. Since the tetrahedron has this symmetric edge structure, maybe we can place it in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.\n\nLet me think. Since the opposite edges are equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. This is a characteristic of a \"disphenoid\", which is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. Disphenoids have some nice properties, like they are isohedral (all faces are congruent) and they can be inscribed in a rectangular box in a certain way. Maybe that can help?\n\nYes, I remember that a disphenoid can be placed in a coordinate system such that its vertices are at (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) for some positive real numbers a, b, c. Then, the opposite edges are equal. Let me verify that.\n\nLet me denote the four vertices as follows:\n\nA = (a, b, c)\n\nB = (-a, -b, c)\n\nC = (-a, b, -c)\n\nD = (a, -b, -c)\n\nThen, let's compute the distances between these points.\n\nFirst, AB: distance between A and B.\n\nCoordinates of A: (a, b, c)\n\nCoordinates of B: (-a, -b, c)\n\nDifference in x: -a - a = -2a\n\nDifference in y: -b - b = -2b\n\nDifference in z: c - c = 0\n\nSo AB distance squared is (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, CD: distance between C and D.\n\nC is (-a, b, -c), D is (a, -b, -c)\n\nDifference in x: a - (-a) = 2a\n\nDifference in y: -b - b = -2b\n\nDifference in z: -c - (-c) = 0\n\nSo CD squared is (2a)^2 + (-2b)^2 + 0 = same as AB squared. So AB = CD, which matches the problem.\n\nSimilarly, AC: distance between A and C.\n\nA: (a, b, c), C: (-a, b, -c)\n\nDifferences: x: -a - a = -2a, y: 0, z: -c - c = -2c\n\nSo AC squared is (2a)^2 + (2c)^2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2\n\nBD: distance between B and D.\n\nB: (-a, -b, c), D: (a, -b, -c)\n\nDifferences: x: a - (-a) = 2a, y: -b - (-b) = 0, z: -c - c = -2c\n\nSo BD squared is (2a)^2 + (2c)^2 = same as AC squared. So AC = BD.\n\nSimilarly, AD: distance between A and D.\n\nA: (a, b, c), D: (a, -b, -c)\n\nDifferences: x: 0, y: -b - b = -2b, z: -c - c = -2c\n\nAD squared is (2b)^2 + (2c)^2 = 4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2\n\nBC: distance between B and C.\n\nB: (-a, -b, c), C: (-a, b, -c)\n\nDifferences: x: 0, y: b - (-b) = 2b, z: -c - c = -2c\n\nBC squared is (2b)^2 + (2c)^2 = same as AD squared. So BC = AD.\n\nPerfect! So this coordinate system works. Therefore, the tetrahedron can be represented with these coordinates, and the edge lengths correspond to the given ones. Therefore, if I can find a, b, c such that:\n\nAB\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 = 41,\n\nAC\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2 = 80,\n\nAD\u00b2 = 4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1) 4a\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2 = 41,\n\n2) 4a\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2 = 80,\n\n3) 4b\u00b2 + 4c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nDivide all equations by 4:\n\n1) a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4,\n\n2) a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20,\n\n3) b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me denote equations as:\n\nEquation (1): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 41/4,\n\nEquation (2): a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 20,\n\nEquation (3): b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nWe can solve for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2.\n\nLet me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 20 - 41/4,\n\nWhich gives c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4.\n\nBut equation (3) is b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nSo we have:\n\nc\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 39/4,\n\nand\n\nc\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 89/4.\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2c\u00b2 = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32,\n\nTherefore, c\u00b2 = 16,\n\nThus c = 4 (since c is positive).\n\nThen, from equation (3): b\u00b2 + 16 = 89/4,\n\nSo b\u00b2 = 89/4 - 16 = 89/4 - 64/4 = 25/4,\n\nThus b = 5/2 = 2.5.\n\nThen from equation (1): a\u00b2 + (25/4) = 41/4,\n\nTherefore, a\u00b2 = 41/4 - 25/4 = 16/4 = 4,\n\nThus a = 2.\n\nSo we have a = 2, b = 5/2, c = 4.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the tetrahedron vertices are:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4),\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4),\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4),\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4).\n\nWait, hold on, let me confirm:\n\nWait, in the coordinate system I set up earlier:\n\nA = (a, b, c) = (2, 5/2, 4),\n\nB = (-a, -b, c) = (-2, -5/2, 4),\n\nC = (-a, b, -c) = (-2, 5/2, -4),\n\nD = (a, -b, -c) = (2, -5/2, -4).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. Since it's a disphenoid, maybe there's a formula, but perhaps it's easier to compute using coordinates.\n\nThe volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates can be found by the scalar triple product formula:\n\nV = | (AB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD)) | / 6.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB, AC, AD from point A.\n\nFirst, let me note the coordinates again:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4),\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4),\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4),\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4).\n\nSo vectors from A:\n\nAB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow, compute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD first.\n\nLet me denote AC = (-4, 0, -8), AD = (0, -5, -8).\n\nThe cross product is:\n\n|i\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0j\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0k|\n\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\n|0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni*(0 - 40) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)\n\nSo:\n\ni*(-40) - j*(32) + k*(20)\n\nTherefore, AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nNow, take the dot product with AB = (-4, -5, 0):\n\nAB \u00b7 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nTherefore, the volume V is |320| / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, but let me confirm the cross product and the dot product again to be sure.\n\nFirst, cross product AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nFirst component (j and k elements of AC and AD):\n\n(AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nSecond component (with a negative sign):\n\n-(AC_x * AD_z - AC_z * AD_x) = -[(-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0] = -[32 - 0] = -32\n\nThird component:\n\nAC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x = (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20\n\nYes, so cross product is (-40, -32, 20). Then the dot product with AB (-4, -5, 0):\n\n(-4)(-40) = 160,\n\n(-5)(-32) = 160,\n\n0*20 = 0,\n\nTotal 160 + 160 = 320. So yes, that's correct. So volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3. Alright.\n\nNow, moving on to the surface area. Since all four faces are congruent, each face has the same area. Let me compute the area of one face, say face ABC.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe compute the area using vectors or coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, since we know the sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), perhaps use Heron's formula here.\n\nWait, let me try Heron's formula first. Let me compute the semi-perimeter s for triangle ABC:\n\ns = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2\n\nBut that might be messy. Alternatively, since we have coordinates for the points, perhaps compute the area via vectors?\n\nLet me take vectors AB and AC, compute their cross product, and then half its magnitude.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, vectors AB and AC are already computed above. Wait, but in 3D space, the area is 1/2 the magnitude of AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nVectors AB and AC are in 3D, so the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nWait, but in our case, AB and AC are edges from point A, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, let me compute AB \u00d7 AC.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8).\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\n|i\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0j\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0k|\n\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00|\n\n|-4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-8|\n\nDeterminant:\n\ni*(-5*(-8) - 0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni*(40 - 0) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(0 - 20)\n\nSo:\n\ni*40 - j*32 + k*(-20)\n\nTherefore, AB \u00d7 AC = (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n40\u00b2 = 1600,\n\n(-32)^2 = 1024,\n\n(-20)^2 = 400,\n\nTotal: 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024\n\nTherefore, |AB \u00d7 AC| = sqrt(3024)\n\nSimplify sqrt(3024):\n\nFactor 3024:\n\nDivide by 16: 3024 /16 = 189, so sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189)\n\nBut 189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7, so sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21). Therefore sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 = 6\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6\u221a21, so total surface area S = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nWait, that's a good simplification. Let me confirm the cross product calculation again.\n\nAB \u00d7 AC components:\n\nFirst component: (-5)(-8) - (0)(0) = 40 - 0 = 40,\n\nSecond component: - [ (-4)(-8) - (0)(-4) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32,\n\nThird component: (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20,\n\nYes, so cross product is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024. sqrt(3024) is sqrt(16*189) = 4*sqrt(189). Then sqrt(189) is sqrt(9*21) = 3*sqrt(21). So total sqrt(3024) is 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12\u221a21. Therefore, area is 6\u221a21. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, total surface area S = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nNow, the volume is 160/3. Therefore, the inradius r = 3V / S = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = (160) / (24\u221a21).\n\nSimplify 160 /24: divide numerator and denominator by 8: 20 / 3. So r = (20)/(3\u221a21).\n\nBut we need to rationalize the denominator. Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21:\n\nr = (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63.\n\nSimplify 20 and 63: 20 and 63 have no common factors (since 63 is 7*9, 20 is 2\u00b2*5). So the fraction is reduced.\n\nTherefore, the distance is 20\u221a21 / 63. So m = 20, n = 21, p = 63. Then m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check again the calculation for the inradius. Let me go through the steps again to confirm.\n\nVolume V = 160/3,\n\nSurface area S = 24\u221a21,\n\nThus r = 3V/S = 3*(160/3)/ (24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21). Yes, that's correct.\n\n160 divided by 24: 160/24 = 20/3, so 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalizing gives 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 /63. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me check if the coordinates approach gives the same result as Heron's formula. Wait, when I computed the area via coordinates, I got 6\u221a21 per face, so total surface area 24\u221a21. Alternatively, using Heron's formula on triangle ABC with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89):\n\nFirst, compute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nThen area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. Let me see if that gives the same as 6\u221a21.\n\nBut that might be tedious, but let me try.\n\nLet me denote a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nCompute s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2,\n\ns - b = (a - b + c)/2,\n\ns - c = (a + b - c)/2.\n\nTherefore, the product s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) would be:\n\n[(a + b + c)/2] * [(-a + b + c)/2] * [(a - b + c)/2] * [(a + b - c)/2]\n\nThis is equal to [(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)] / 16? Wait, maybe better to note that this product is equal to ( ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 )( (a + c)^2 - b^2 ) ) / 16 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.\n\nAlternatively, since we know from the coordinate method that the area is 6\u221a21, so let's see if Heron's formula gives the same.\n\nCompute s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.\n\nLet me compute numerically:\n\nsqrt(41) \u2248 6.4031,\n\nsqrt(80) \u2248 8.9443,\n\nsqrt(89) \u2248 9.4336,\n\nSum \u2248 6.4031 + 8.9443 + 9.4336 \u2248 24.781,\n\ns \u2248 24.781 / 2 \u2248 12.3905.\n\nThen s - a \u2248 12.3905 - 6.4031 \u2248 5.9874,\n\ns - b \u2248 12.3905 - 8.9443 \u2248 3.4462,\n\ns - c \u2248 12.3905 - 9.4336 \u2248 2.9569.\n\nThen the product s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) \u2248 12.3905 * 5.9874 * 3.4462 * 2.9569.\n\nThis is going to be a bit tedious, but let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst multiply 12.3905 * 5.9874 \u2248 12.3905 * 6 \u2248 74.343, but subtract 12.3905 * 0.0126 \u2248 0.156, so approx 74.343 - 0.156 \u2248 74.187.\n\nThen 3.4462 * 2.9569 \u2248 3 * 3 = 9, but more precisely:\n\n3.4462 * 2.9569 \u2248 (3 + 0.4462)*(2.9569) \u2248 3*2.9569 + 0.4462*2.9569 \u2248 8.8707 + 1.320 \u2248 10.1907.\n\nThen multiply the two results: 74.187 * 10.1907 \u2248 74.187*10 + 74.187*0.1907 \u2248 741.87 + ~14.15 \u2248 756.02.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(756.02) \u2248 27.5, but 27.5 squared is 756.25, so that's close. Wait, but 6\u221a21 is approximately 6*4.583 \u2248 27.5, which matches. So sqrt(756.02) \u2248 27.5, which is 6\u221a21. Since \u221a21 \u2248 4.58366, so 6*4.58366 \u2248 27.502, so that's correct. Therefore, Heron's formula gives the same result. So that's good.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is indeed 20\u221a21 / 63. Let me check if this can be simplified further. 20 and 63 are coprime (since 63 is 7*3^2, and 20 is 2^2*5). The denominator is 63, which is 7*3^2. The numerator is 20\u221a21, and 21 is 3*7, so inside the sqrt, 21 is square-free. So the expression is in simplest terms. Therefore, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63, so m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me just make sure that the inradius formula is indeed 3V/S. Let me recall that for a tetrahedron, the inradius is the volume divided by the surface area times 3? Wait, actually, in 3D, the formula is analogous to 2D. In 2D, area = inradius * semiperimeter. In 3D, volume = (1/3)*surface area * inradius? Wait, let me confirm.\n\nYes, actually, in 3D, the formula is Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Wait, no, that can't be, because in 2D, area = inradius * semiperimeter. So in 3D, Volume = (1/3) * Surface Area * inradius. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is:\n\nIn a tetrahedron, the volume V is equal to (1/3) times the inradius r times the total surface area S. So V = (1/3) r S, so solving for r gives r = 3V/S. Yes, that's correct. So my calculation was right. So 3*(160/3)/ (24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21). So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 20\u221a21 / 63, so 20 + 21 + 63 = 104. Hmm, but let me check once again the cross product and volume calculation because sometimes signs can be tricky, but since we take absolute value, it's okay.\n\nWait, the cross product AC \u00d7 AD was (-40, -32, 20), then the dot product with AB (-4, -5, 0) gave 160 + 160 = 320. So the scalar triple product is 320, so volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute the volume? Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, perhaps it can be inscribed in a rectangular box, and the volume can be computed as 1/3 of the box's volume or something?\n\nWait, actually, in the coordinate system we set up, the coordinates are such that the tetrahedron is part of a cube or a rectangular prism?\n\nLooking at the coordinates:\n\nA = (2, 5/2, 4),\n\nB = (-2, -5/2, 4),\n\nC = (-2, 5/2, -4),\n\nD = (2, -5/2, -4).\n\nSo the coordinates are symmetric with respect to all axes. The maximum x-coordinate is 2, minimum is -2; y from -5/2 to 5/2; z from -4 to 4.\n\nTherefore, the bounding box would have dimensions from -2 to 2 in x (length 4), -5/2 to 5/2 in y (length 5), and -4 to 4 in z (length 8). So the volume of the box is 4*5*8 = 160. Then, the tetrahedron's volume is 1/3 of that? Wait, 160/3 is exactly the volume we found. Wait, so that's a nice check.\n\nBecause in a disphenoid, the volume is indeed 1/3 of the rectangular box in which it's inscribed. So that's a good confirmation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The inradius is 20\u221a21 / 63, so m + n + p is 104.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check the problem statement again. It says \"the distances from I to each of the faces are all equal\". So that point is indeed the incenter, and the formula applies. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach? Let me think if there's another way someone might approach this problem without coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps using some formula for the inradius in terms of the edges?\n\nBut I think the coordinate method was straightforward here, given the symmetric edge lengths. So I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n</think>\n\nGiven a tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with edges \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\), we need to find the distance from the incenter \\(I\\) to each face, which is the inradius. \n\nFirst, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning all faces are congruent triangles. We use coordinates to model the tetrahedron, placing vertices at:\n- \\(A = (a, b, c)\\)\n- \\(B = (-a, -b, c)\\)\n- \\(C = (-a, b, -c)\\)\n- \\(D = (a, -b, -c)\\)\n\nSolving for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) using the given edge lengths:\n1. \\(4a^2 + 4b^2 = 41\\)\n2. \\(4a^2 + 4c^2 = 80\\)\n3. \\(4b^2 + 4c^2 = 89\\)\n\nWe find \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = \\frac{5}{2}\\), and \\(c = 4\\). \n\nNext, we calculate the volume \\(V\\) using the scalar triple product:\n- Vectors from \\(A\\): \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\\)\n- Cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = (-40, -32, 20)\\)\n- Dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) = 320\\)\n- Volume \\(V = \\frac{320}{6} = \\frac{160}{3}\\)\n\nThe surface area \\(S\\) is four times the area of one face. Using the cross product for face \\(ABC\\):\n- Cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AC} = (40, -32, -20)\\)\n- Area of one face: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{3024} = 6\\sqrt{21}\\)\n- Total surface area \\(S = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\\)\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by \\(r = \\frac{3V}{S}\\):\n- \\(r = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\\)\n\nThus, \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\), leading to \\(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\\).\n\n\\boxed{104}"
