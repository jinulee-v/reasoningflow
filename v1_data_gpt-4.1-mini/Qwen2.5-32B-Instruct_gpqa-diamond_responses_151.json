        "question": "You identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in the bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus. You are highly interested if its role in intercellular communication is conserved among the eukaryotes. You treat yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the peptide and interestingly observe the formation of the shmoo. You want to learn about the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo and recover it by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. The least of proteins from which complex below will you observe in your assay?\nA. pre-initiation complex\nB. enhancer protein complex\nC. pre-replication complex\nD. nucleosome histone complex",
        "response": "In the context of your experiment, where you're interested in the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo formed after treating yeast with a quorum-sensing peptide, the focus is on transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure that is actively involved in gene expression.\n\n- **Pre-initiation complex (PIC)**: This complex assembles at the promoter region of genes to initiate transcription. It includes RNA polymerase II and several general transcription factors. Since active chromatin is associated with ongoing or potential transcription, components of the PIC would be expected to be present.\n  \n- **Enhancer protein complex**: Enhancers are regulatory DNA sequences that can increase the likelihood of transcription of genes they control. Proteins that bind to these enhancers and help recruit the transcription machinery would also be expected to be part of the active chromatin landscape.\n\n- **Pre-replication complex (pre-RC)**: This complex is essential for the initiation of DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle. While important for cell division, it is not directly related to transcriptional activity or chromatin remodeling in the context of active gene expression.\n\n- **Nucleosome histone complex**: Nucleosomes are the basic unit of chromatin, consisting of DNA wrapped around histone octamers. They are fundamental to chromatin structure and can be modified (e.g., acetylation, methylation) to influence gene expression. Therefore, histones and their modifications are crucial for understanding active chromatin states.\n\nGiven this information, the **least** likely complex to be observed in your assay focused on the active chromatin of the shmoo would be the **pre-replication complex (C)**, as it is more specifically tied to DNA replication rather than transcriptional regulation and chromatin activation."
