        "question": "Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One  hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K. As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?\nA. ~0.32\nB. ~0.11\nC. ~0.39\nD. ~0.07",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots. Let me start by recalling what I know about light curves and rotational modulation. \n\nFirst, the problem states that one hemisphere of the star has dark spots covering 20% of its surface (filling factor of 20%). The spots are 1000K cooler than the effective temperature of the star, which is 6000K. The question is asking, if instead of these spots, there was an exoplanet transiting the star, what would the planet's radius relative to the star's radius need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?\n\nHmm, so I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit. Let me think about how each of these affects the light curve.\n\nStarting with the spots: when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere will come into view and then rotate out of view, causing periodic dimming and brightening. The amplitude of this variation depends on the area covered by the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.\n\nFor the planet transit, the amplitude is determined by the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius squared, right? Because when the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's light equal to (R_pl / R_star)^2. But maybe I need to be more precise here.\n\nWait, actually, the transit depth is (R_pl / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is much smaller than the star and the light is uniform across the star's disk. But in the case of the spots, the situation is a bit different because the spots are not blocking light but are instead emitting less light. So the total flux from the star varies as the spots rotate in and out of view.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nFirst, let's compute the flux variation due to the spots.\n\nThe effective temperature of the star is Teff = 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K.\n\nThe flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = \u03c3 T^4. So the flux from a spot is F_spot = \u03c3*(5000)^4, and the flux from the non-spotted regions is F_star = \u03c3*(6000)^4.\n\nThe filling factor is 20%, so 20% of one hemisphere is covered by spots. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (1/2) of the total surface area of the star. Wait, actually, the star's total surface area is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. A hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2. So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2. But when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere will sometimes be facing us and sometimes not. The maximum effect would be when the spotted hemisphere is fully facing us, and the minimum when it's edge-on, but actually, the variation depends on the angle as the star rotates. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the average flux over a rotation period?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the amplitude of the variation is the difference between when the spotted hemisphere is facing us and when it's not. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me consider the star's rotation. Let's assume the star is rotating such that the spotted hemisphere rotates in and out of our view. The maximum flux occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. Wait, actually, the spotted hemisphere is only on one side, so when that side is facing us, the spots are visible, reducing the total flux. When the other hemisphere is facing us, there are no spots, so the flux is higher. Therefore, the amplitude of the variation is the difference between the flux when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us and when the spotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nSo let's compute the total flux in both cases.\n\nFirst, when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us: the entire visible hemisphere (which is the non-spotted one) has no spots, so the flux is just the flux from a normal star with Teff = 6000 K. The flux from a hemisphere is (\u03c3 T^4) * (2\u03c0R\u00b2), but since we are considering the total flux, maybe we can just consider the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the fractional change in flux.\n\nLet me denote the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us as F_spotted, and when the non-spotted is facing as F_non_spotted.\n\nThe amplitude of the variation would be (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted, which is the fractional change.\n\nSo let's compute F_spotted and F_non_spotted.\n\nFirst, F_non_spotted is the flux from a normal star with no spots on the visible hemisphere. Since the non-spotted hemisphere has no spots, the entire visible hemisphere (which is the non-spotted one) emits at Teff = 6000 K. Wait, but actually, the star's total surface is 4\u03c0R\u00b2. The visible hemisphere is 2\u03c0R\u00b2, but the spots are only on one hemisphere (the other side). Wait, actually, the problem says \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots\". So the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the visible side has spots, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, the visible side has no spots.\n\nTherefore, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots (since the filling factor is 20% on that hemisphere). The rest is normal.\n\nTherefore, the flux from the visible hemisphere when the spotted side is facing us is:\n\nF_spotted_visible = (Area_non_spotted * F_star) + (Area_spots * F_spot)\n\nWhere Area_non_spotted is 80% of the visible hemisphere, and Area_spots is 20%.\n\nBut since we are considering the total flux, which is the sum over the entire visible hemisphere (which is half the star's surface), the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is:\n\nF_spotted_total = (0.8 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2) * \u03c3*(6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2) * \u03c3*(5000)^4\n\nSimilarly, when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire visible hemisphere (2\u03c0R\u00b2) is at 6000 K, so:\n\nF_non_spotted_total = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 * \u03c3*(6000)^4\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the variation is (F_non_spotted_total - F_spotted_total)/F_non_spotted_total.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's factor out common terms:\n\nF_non_spotted_total = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4\n\nF_spotted_total = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nTherefore, the ratio (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted is:\n\n[2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4)] / [2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [ (6000)^4 - 0.8*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]\n\n= 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [ 0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4 ]\n\nFactor out 0.2:\n\n= 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 * 0.2 [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ]\n\nTherefore, the ratio becomes:\n\n[0.2 (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / (6000^4)\n\nSo the fractional amplitude is 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]\n\nLet me compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 \u2248 (0.8333)^4 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating (5/6)^4:\n\nFirst, 5/6 \u2248 0.8333\n\n0.8333^2 \u2248 0.6944\n\nThen squared again: 0.6944^2 \u2248 0.4823\n\nSo (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.4823\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.4823 \u2248 0.5177\n\nMultiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.5177 \u2248 0.1035\n\nSo the fractional amplitude is approximately 0.1035, or about 10.35%.\n\nWait, so the amplitude of the light curve due to the spots is about 10.35%.\n\nNow, for the exoplanet transit, the amplitude (depth) is (R_pl / R_star)^2, assuming the planet is small and the transit is edge-on. Since the question says \"to produce the same amplitude signal\", we need to set (R_pl / R_star)^2 equal to 0.1035?\n\nWait, but hold on. The transit depth is the fractional decrease in flux, which is (R_pl / R_star)^2. However, in the case of the spots, the amplitude is the difference between maximum and minimum flux divided by the average flux? Wait, actually, in the case of the spots, the amplitude is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted, which is the maximum fractional decrease. But in the case of the transit, the depth is the minimum flux compared to the out-of-transit flux, so it's (F_out - F_in)/F_out = (R_pl/R_star)^2. So yes, the amplitude of the transit is exactly (R_pl/R_star)^2. Therefore, to get the same amplitude, we set (R_pl/R_star)^2 = 0.1035, so R_pl/R_star = sqrt(0.1035) \u2248 sqrt(0.1) is ~0.316, sqrt(0.1035) is a bit higher. Let me compute sqrt(0.1035):\n\nsqrt(0.1035) \u2248 0.3217. So approximately 0.32, which is option A.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check my calculations again because the options include 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121), so maybe I made a mistake in the spot calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the fractional amplitude step by step.\n\nFirst, the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us:\n\nThe visible hemisphere has 20% spots and 80% normal.\n\nSo the flux from the visible hemisphere is:\n\nF_spotted = (0.8 * F_star + 0.2 * F_spot) * (visible hemisphere area)\n\nBut since we are comparing to the non-spotted case, which is F_non_spotted = F_star * (visible hemisphere area). Therefore, the ratio (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted is:\n\n[ F_star - (0.8 F_star + 0.2 F_spot) ] / F_star = [0.2 F_star - 0.2 F_spot]/F_star = 0.2 (F_star - F_spot)/F_star\n\nTherefore, the fractional amplitude is 0.2*(1 - F_spot/F_star)\n\nSince F is proportional to T^4, F_spot/F_star = (5000/6000)^4 \u2248 (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.4823 as before.\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.4823 \u2248 0.5177, so 0.2 * 0.5177 \u2248 0.1035, so that's correct. So the amplitude is ~10.35%, so the transit depth needed is 10.35%, so (R_pl/R_star)^2 = 0.1035, so R_pl/R_star \u2248 sqrt(0.1035) \u2248 0.3217, so ~0.32, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options include 0.11 (B) and 0.07 (D). Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the filling factor. The problem says \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". Does that mean that 20% of the entire star's surface is covered in spots, but all on one hemisphere? Or does it mean that 20% of each hemisphere is covered?\n\nWait, the wording is \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the area covered on the surface where the feature is present. So if the entire hemisphere is the area in question, then 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. So that would mean 20% of half the star's surface, so 10% of the total surface area. But when the star rotates, the visible hemisphere alternates between the spotted and non-spotted. Therefore, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the visible hemisphere is spots, and 80% is normal. When the non-spotted is facing, 0% spots. So my previous calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filling factor is 20% over the entire star? But the problem says \"one hemisphere... filling factor of 20%\", so probably 20% of that hemisphere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the entire star's surface, so the total area covered by spots is 20% of the star's surface, all on one hemisphere. Then the area of the hemisphere is half the star's surface, so 20% of the star's surface would be 40% of the hemisphere. Wait, but that would be a filling factor of 40% on the hemisphere. The problem says filling factor is 20%, so that must be 20% of the hemisphere's area.\n\nTherefore, my original calculation is correct. So the amplitude is ~10%, so the planet radius ratio is sqrt(0.1035) ~0.32, so answer A.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A. ~0.32, B. ~0.11, C. ~0.39, D. ~0.07.\n\nHmm, so 0.32 is an option. But maybe I made a mistake in the temperature difference?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K\". So the spots are 1000K cooler, so 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K, which I used. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the average temperature of the star when spots are present? Wait, but the effective temperature given is already the Teff of the star, so that should already account for the spots? Wait, hold on, this is a crucial point.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K\". But if the star has spots, the effective temperature would actually be lower, because the spots emit less. However, the problem states that the star's Teff is 6000K, so perhaps that is the Teff of the unspotted star? Wait, the wording is ambiguous here.\n\nWait, let me read again: \"Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K.\"\n\nHmm, so the star's Teff is given as 6000K, but it has spots. So does that mean that the Teff already accounts for the spots? Or is the Teff the temperature of the non-spotted regions?\n\nThis is a critical point. If the Teff given is the effective temperature of the entire star (including spots), then the non-spotted regions must be hotter than 6000K to compensate for the cooler spots. Alternatively, if the Teff is the temperature of the non-spotted regions, then the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K, and the overall Teff of the star would be lower. But the problem states the star has Teff 6000K, so probably the Teff is the effective temperature of the entire star, considering the spots. Therefore, my previous approach is wrong because I assumed the non-spotted regions are at 6000K, but actually, the entire star's Teff is 6000K, so the non-spotted regions must be hotter to compensate for the cooler spots.\n\nOh no, this complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the star has two regions: spotted and non-spotted. The spotted regions have temperature T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K, and the non-spotted regions have a higher temperature T_non_spot. The effective temperature of the entire star is given as 6000 K. Therefore, we need to compute T_non_spot such that the average flux over the entire star's surface gives an effective temperature of 6000 K.\n\nWait, the effective temperature is defined such that the total flux from the star is \u03c3 Teff^4 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Therefore, the total flux must equal the sum of the flux from the spotted and non-spotted regions.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nTotal surface area of the star: 4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThe spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere, so 0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThe non-spotted area on the same hemisphere is 0.8*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) = 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThe other hemisphere has no spots, so its area is 2\u03c0R\u00b2, all at T_non_spot.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem says \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". So the other hemisphere has no spots. Therefore, the total spotted area is 0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2, and the non-spotted area on the spotted hemisphere is 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2, plus the entire other hemisphere (2\u03c0R\u00b2) which is non-spotted. Therefore, total non-spotted area is 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2 + 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the total flux from the star is:\n\nF_total = (Area_spots * \u03c3 T_spot^4) + (Area_non_spotted * \u03c3 T_non_spot^4)\n\nBut the effective temperature is given by F_total = \u03c3 Teff^4 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u03c3 [0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4 + 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2 T_non_spot^4] = \u03c3 Teff^4 *4\u03c0R\u00b2\n\nCancel out \u03c3 and \u03c0R\u00b2:\n\n0.4 T_spot^4 + 3.6 T_non_spot^4 = 4 Teff^4\n\nWe know Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K (since the spots are 1000 K cooler). Wait, but hold on, if the spots are 1000 K cooler than the effective temperature? Or cooler than the non-spotted regions?\n\nThe problem says \"the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K\". The wording is ambiguous. Is the temperature difference between the spots and the effective temperature, or between the spots and the non-spotted regions?\n\nThis is another ambiguity. If the temperature difference is between the spots and the non-spotted regions, then T_spot = T_non_spot - 1000 K. If it's between spots and the effective temperature, then T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K, but then we have to find T_non_spot such that the average gives Teff = 6000 K.\n\nThe problem says \"the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K\". Since it's an astronomy context, usually the temperature difference of spots is relative to the surrounding photosphere (i.e., the non-spotted regions). So probably T_spot = T_non_spot - 1000 K.\n\nTherefore, let me define variables again with that in mind.\n\nLet T_non_spot be the temperature of the non-spotted regions (both on the spotted hemisphere and the non-spotted hemisphere). The spots have T_spot = T_non_spot - 1000 K.\n\nThe total flux is then:\n\nF_total = \u03c3 [ (Area_spots * T_spot^4) + (Area_non_spotted * T_non_spot^4) ]\n\n= \u03c3 [ (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)(T_non_spot - 1000)^4 + (3.6\u03c0R\u00b2)(T_non_spot)^4 ]\n\nSet equal to \u03c3 * Teff^4 *4\u03c0R\u00b2:\n\n0.4 (T_non_spot - 1000)^4 + 3.6 T_non_spot^4 = 4*(6000)^4\n\nThis equation allows us to solve for T_non_spot.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can approximate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the temperature difference is with respect to the effective temperature, so T_spot = Teff - 1000 = 5000 K, and the non-spotted regions are at Teff = 6000 K. But then the effective temperature of the star would not be 6000 K, unless the non-spotted regions compensate. Wait, but if the non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, then the average would be lower because of the spots. Therefore, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is intended to ignore the effect of the spots on the effective temperature, and just take the non-spotted regions as 6000 K, and the spots as 5000 K, even though that would make the star's actual effective temperature lower. Maybe the question is simplifying, assuming that the given Teff is the temperature of the non-spotted regions, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so we can proceed with that, even though strictly speaking the effective temperature would be different. Since the problem says \"the star has an effective temperature of 6000K\", perhaps we are to take that as the temperature of the non-spotted regions, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K, and the variation is calculated as before, ignoring the fact that the actual effective temperature would be lower. Maybe that's the intended approach here.\n\nGiven that the problem is from an exam, perhaps they expect the first approach where we take the non-spotted regions at 6000 K, spots at 5000 K, and compute the amplitude as 10%, leading to R_pl/R_star ~0.32, which is option A. But since the options include 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121), maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the area again. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2\u03c0R\u00b2, of which 20% is spots. So the area of spots in the visible hemisphere is 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2, and non-spotted is 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2. The total flux from the visible hemisphere when spotted side is facing us is:\n\nF_spotted_visible = (1.6\u03c0R\u00b2)(\u03c3*(6000)^4) + (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)(\u03c3*(5000)^4)\n\nThe flux when non-spotted side is facing is F_non_spotted_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2*(\u03c3*(6000)^4)\n\nTherefore, the difference in flux between the two is:\n\n\u0394F = F_non_spotted_visible - F_spotted_visible = [2\u03c0R\u00b2 - 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2]*(\u03c3*(6000)^4) - 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2*(\u03c3*(5000)^4)\n\nWait, actually, let me compute F_non_spotted_visible - F_spotted_visible:\n\nF_non_spotted_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4\n\nF_spotted_visible = 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 + 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5000)^4\n\nThus,\n\n\u0394F = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - [1.6\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 + 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5000)^4]\n\n= (2 - 1.6) \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5000)^4\n\n= 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5000)^4\n\n= 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ]\n\nTherefore, the fractional amplitude is \u0394F / F_non_spotted_visible\n\nWhich is [0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / [2 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.4 / 2 * [ (6000^4 - 5000^4)/6000^4 ]\n\n= 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]\n\nSame as before, so 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4) \u2248 0.1035, so 10.35% amplitude.\n\nTherefore, the transit depth needed is 10.35%, so R_pl/R_star = sqrt(0.1035) \u2248 0.3217, so ~0.32, which is option A.\n\nBut the options have B as ~0.11. Hmm. Maybe the question is considering that the spots are on both hemispheres but with 20% filling factor? Wait, no, the problem says \"one hemisphere\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the filling factor is 20% over the entire star, so 10% on each hemisphere? But the problem says \"one hemisphere... filling factor of 20%\", so that's 20% of one hemisphere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the amplitude is half of what I calculated? Because the maximum variation is between the two states, but the average is somewhere in between, so the amplitude is the peak-to-peak divided by the average?\n\nWait, in my calculation, I took (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted, which is the maximum fractional decrease. However, the average flux over a rotation period would be the average of F_spotted and F_non_spotted, since the star spends half its time with each hemisphere facing us (assuming synchronous rotation or uniform rotation period). Therefore, the average flux is (F_spotted + F_non_spotted)/2.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude (peak-to-peak) is F_non_spotted - F_spotted, and the fractional amplitude relative to the average would be (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/[(F_spotted + F_non_spotted)/2] = 2*(F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/(F_spotted + F_non_spotted)\n\nWait, but in the case of the transit, the amplitude is the depth, which is (F_out - F_in)/F_out, which is the same as the fractional decrease. So if the question is asking for the same amplitude in the light curve, which is the depth (the minimum flux compared to the out-of-transit), then the spots' amplitude is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted, which is the same as the transit depth. Therefore, my original calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the amplitude as the peak-to-peak divided by the average, which would be different. Let me check:\n\nIf the average flux is (F_spotted + F_non_spotted)/2, then the amplitude (peak-to-peak) is F_non_spotted - F_spotted, so the fractional amplitude is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/[(F_spotted + F_non_spotted)/2] = 2*(F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/(F_spotted + F_non_spotted)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nF_non_spotted = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4\n\nF_spotted = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nTherefore,\n\nF_spotted + F_non_spotted = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 + (6000)^4] = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [1.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nF_non_spotted - F_spotted = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4] = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nTherefore, the fractional amplitude (peak-to-peak over average) is:\n\n[2*(0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4)] / [1.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 0.4*(6000^4 - 5000^4)\n\nDenominator: 1.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4\n\nLet me factor out (6000)^4 from numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 0.4*(6000^4)*(1 - (5/6)^4 )\n\nDenominator: (6000)^4 [1.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 ]\n\nTherefore, the fractional amplitude becomes:\n\n[0.4*(1 - (5/6)^4 )] / [1.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 ]\n\nCompute (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.4823 as before.\n\nSo numerator: 0.4*(1 - 0.4823) \u2248 0.4*0.5177 \u2248 0.2071\n\nDenominator: 1.8 + 0.2*0.4823 \u2248 1.8 + 0.0965 \u2248 1.8965\n\nTherefore, fractional amplitude \u2248 0.2071 / 1.8965 \u2248 0.1092, so ~10.9%, which is still around 10%, so the transit depth would still be ~10%, leading to R_pl/R_star ~0.32.\n\nHmm, so even considering the average, it's still about 10%, so the answer should be A. But the options have B as 0.11, which is close to sqrt(0.0121)=0.11, but 0.32 squared is ~0.1, so maybe the question is considering something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the entire non-spotted hemisphere is at 6000 K. If the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the non-spotted regions are hotter to compensate for the cooler spots, then the actual temperature of the non-spotted regions would be higher, so the difference between the spots and the non-spotted regions is more than 1000 K?\n\nWait, let's try this approach again, considering that the effective temperature is 6000 K, so we have to compute T_non_spot such that the average gives Teff = 6000 K.\n\nLet me define variables again:\n\nLet T_spot = T_non_spot - 1000 K (since the temperature difference is 1000 K between spots and non-spotted regions).\n\nTotal flux:\n\nF_total = \u03c3 [0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 (T_non_spot - 1000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2 T_non_spot^4 ]\n\nSet equal to \u03c3 * Teff^4 *4\u03c0R\u00b2:\n\n0.4 (T_non_spot - 1000)^4 + 3.6 T_non_spot^4 = 4*(6000)^4\n\nLet me denote x = T_non_spot.\n\nThen,\n\n0.4 (x - 1000)^4 + 3.6 x^4 = 4*(6000)^4\n\nThis equation needs to be solved for x.\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which is complicated, but maybe we can approximate.\n\nLet me assume that x is close to 6000 K. Let me try x = 6000 K:\n\nLeft side: 0.4*(5000)^4 + 3.6*(6000)^4\n\nCompute (5000)^4 = (5/6 *6000)^4 = (5/6)^4*(6000)^4 \u2248 0.4823*(6000)^4\n\nThus,\n\n0.4*0.4823*(6000)^4 + 3.6*(6000)^4 \u2248 (0.1929 + 3.6)*(6000)^4 \u2248 3.7929*(6000)^4\n\nBut the right side is 4*(6000)^4, so 3.7929 < 4, so x needs to be higher to increase the left side.\n\nLet me try x = 6200 K.\n\nCompute (x - 1000) = 5200 K.\n\nCompute (5200)^4 / (6000)^4 = (52/60)^4 = (13/15)^4 \u2248 (0.8667)^4 \u2248 0.5625\n\nWait, 13/15 is ~0.8667, so (0.8667)^2 \u2248 0.75, then squared again is ~0.5625.\n\nThus,\n\n0.4*(5200)^4 + 3.6*(6200)^4 \u2248 0.4*0.5625*(6000)^4 + 3.6*( (62/60)^4 )*(6000)^4\n\nFirst term: 0.4*0.5625 = 0.225\n\nSecond term: 3.6*( (62/60)^4 )\n\n62/60 \u2248 1.0333, so (1.0333)^4 \u2248 approx 1.14 (since (1 + 0.0333)^4 \u2248 1 + 4*0.0333 + 6*(0.0333)^2 + ... \u2248 1 + 0.1332 + 0.0666 + ... \u2248 1.2). Let me compute more accurately:\n\n1.0333^2 = 1.0677, then squared again: 1.0677^2 \u2248 1.140, so yes, ~1.14.\n\nThus, second term: 3.6 * 1.14 \u2248 4.104\n\nTotal left side: 0.225 + 4.104 \u2248 4.329, multiplied by (6000)^4. The right side is 4*(6000)^4. So 4.329 > 4, so x=6200 gives left side too big.\n\nWe need to find x where left side =4.\n\nLet me try x=6100 K.\n\nThen x-1000=5100 K.\n\nCompute (5100/6000)^4 = (17/20)^4 = (0.85)^4 \u2248 0.522\n\n(6100/6000)^4 = (1.016666...)^4 \u2248 approx 1.068 (since (1.0167)^2 \u22481.0336, then squared again \u22481.068)\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term: 0.4 *0.522*(6000)^4 \u22480.2088*(6000)^4\n\nSecond term: 3.6*(1.068)*(6000)^4 \u22483.6*1.068\u22483.8448*(6000)^4\n\nTotal left side: (0.2088 + 3.8448)=4.0536*(6000)^4, which is still higher than 4.\n\nNeed x a bit lower.\n\nTry x=6050 K.\n\nx-1000=5050 K.\n\n(5050/6000)^4 = (1.01/1.2)^4? Wait, 5050/6000 = 0.841666...\n\n(0.841666)^4 \u2248 ?\n\n0.84^2 = 0.7056, then squared: ~0.7056^2 \u22480.4979\n\n0.841666^4 \u2248 approx 0.5.\n\n(6050/6000)^4 = (1.0083)^4 \u2248 approx 1.0336 (since (1.0083)^2\u22481.0167, then squared again\u22481.0336)\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term: 0.4 *0.5*(6000)^4 =0.2*(6000)^4\n\nSecond term: 3.6 *1.0336*(6000)^4 \u22483.721*(6000)^4\n\nTotal left side: 0.2 +3.721\u22483.921*(6000)^4 <4.\n\nSo between 6050 and 6100.\n\nLet me try x=6075 K.\n\nx-1000=5075 K.\n\n5075/6000\u22480.8458\n\n(0.8458)^4: Let's compute step by step.\n\n0.8458^2 \u22480.7154\n\nThen squared: 0.7154^2\u22480.5118\n\n(6075/6000)=1.0125\n\n(1.0125)^4: 1.0125^2\u22481.025156, then squared\u22481.051.\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term:0.4 *0.5118\u22480.2047\n\nSecond term:3.6 *1.051\u22483.7836\n\nTotal:0.2047+3.7836\u22483.9883*(6000)^4, still less than 4.\n\nNeed a bit higher x.\n\nTry x=6080 K.\n\nx-1000=5080 K.\n\n5080/6000\u22480.8467\n\n(0.8467)^4\u2248?\n\n0.8467^2\u22480.7168, then squared\u22480.5139\n\n(6080/6000)=1.0133\n\n(1.0133)^4\u2248?\n\n1.0133^2\u22481.0268, then squared\u22481.0544\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term:0.4*0.5139\u22480.2056\n\nSecond term:3.6*1.0544\u22483.8\n\nTotal\u22480.2056+3.8\u22484.0056*(6000)^4, which is very close to 4.0056\u22484.0056\u22484.0056, so x\u22486080 K.\n\nTherefore, T_non_spot\u22486080 K.\n\nTherefore, the non-spotted regions are at ~6080 K, and the spots are at 6080-1000=5080 K.\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the non-spotted regions is ~6080 K, spots ~5080 K.\n\nNow, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has 20% spots (at 5080 K) and 80% non-spotted (at 6080 K).\n\nThe flux from the visible hemisphere when spotted side is facing us is:\n\nF_spotted_visible = 0.8*(2\u03c0R\u00b2)*\u03c3*(6080)^4 + 0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2)*\u03c3*(5080)^4\n\nThe flux when non-spotted side is facing is F_non_spotted_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(6080)^4\n\nTherefore, the difference in flux is:\n\n\u0394F = F_non_spotted_visible - F_spotted_visible = [2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(6080)^4] - [0.8*2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(6080)^4 + 0.2*2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(5080)^4]\n\n= 2\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 [ (6080)^4 - 0.8*(6080)^4 -0.2*(5080)^4 ]\n\n= 2\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 [0.2*(6080)^4 -0.2*(5080)^4 ]\n\n= 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 [ (6080)^4 - (5080)^4 ]\n\nThe fractional amplitude is \u0394F / F_non_spotted_visible:\n\n[0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 (6080^4 -5080^4)] / [2\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 (6080)^4 ]\n\n= 0.2 [1 - (5080/6080)^4 ]\n\nCompute (5080/6080) = 508/608 \u22480.836\n\n(0.836)^4 \u2248 ?\n\n0.836^2 \u22480.698896\n\nThen squared: ~0.698896^2 \u22480.488\n\nThus,\n\n1 -0.488\u22480.512\n\nMultiply by 0.2: 0.1024, so ~10.24%.\n\nSo even after correcting for the effective temperature, the fractional amplitude is still ~10%, leading to R_pl/R_star ~0.32.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut the options have B as 0.11. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the temperature?\n\nWait, when I calculated T_non_spot\u22486080 K, but let me check with x=6080:\n\nLeft side:\n\n0.4*(x-1000)^4 +3.6x^4 =0.4*(5080)^4 +3.6*(6080)^4\n\nLet me compute the ratio to (6000)^4:\n\nLet me compute (5080/6000)=0.8467, so (5080)^4=(0.8467)^4*(6000)^4\u22480.5139*(6000)^4\n\nSimilarly, (6080/6000)=1.0133, so (6080)^4\u2248(1.0133)^4*(6000)^4\u22481.0544*(6000)^4\n\nThus,\n\n0.4*0.5139 +3.6*1.0544 \u22480.2056 +3.7958\u22484.0014, which is very close to 4.0014\u22484.0014\u22484.0014, so yes, x=6080 K is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation holds. So the amplitude is ~10%, so the planet radius ratio is sqrt(0.1024)=0.32, so answer A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum divided by the maximum, which is what I did, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the spots are on both hemispheres but with 20% filling factor each? But the problem says \"one hemisphere\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the filling factor is 20% over the entire star, so 10% on each hemisphere? But the problem states \"one hemisphere... filling factor of 20%\", so that's 20% of one hemisphere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the temperature difference is 1000 K relative to the effective temperature, so spots are at 5000 K, and non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, even though that would make the effective temperature lower. If we proceed with that, then the amplitude is ~10%, leading to 0.32, which is answer A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the transit depth. The transit depth is (R_pl/R_star)^2, but if the planet is transiting, it's only covering a small part of the star, so the depth is indeed (R_pl/R_star)^2. So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the amplitude as the difference between the maximum and minimum divided by the average, which we calculated as ~10.9%, so sqrt(0.109)=0.33, still close to 0.32.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, so 10% on each hemisphere. Let me try that.\n\nIf the filling factor is 20% over the entire star, then total spotted area is 0.2*4\u03c0R\u00b2=0.8\u03c0R\u00b2. If distributed equally on both hemispheres, each hemisphere has 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 spots. Then when a hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 spots and 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2 non-spotted.\n\nThen the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us would be:\n\nF_spotted_visible = (1.6\u03c0R\u00b2)*\u03c3*(6000)^4 + (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)*\u03c3*(5000)^4\n\nF_non_spotted_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(6000)^4 (since the other hemisphere has 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 spots, but when the non-spotted side is facing, actually, no, if spots are on both hemispheres, then when any hemisphere is facing, it has 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 spots. Wait, if spots are distributed over the entire star with 20% filling factor, then each hemisphere has 10% spots. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nThe problem explicitly states \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". So it's 20% of one hemisphere, so my original calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A, 0.32. But since the options include B as 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121), maybe I made a mistake in the temperature difference?\n\nWait, if the temperature difference is 1000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler than the effective temperature, then T_spot = 5000 K, and non-spotted regions are at Teff =6000 K. Then the effective temperature of the star would actually be lower than 6000 K, but the problem says the star has Teff=6000 K. Therefore, this is impossible unless the non-spotted regions are hotter.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the one where we computed T_non_spot\u22486080 K, leading to the same ~10% amplitude. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum divided by the maximum, which is what I did, so 10%, so sqrt(0.1)=0.316, which rounds to 0.32, so A.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we compare the flux variations caused by the spots to those caused by a planet transit.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Spot Flux Calculation**:\n   - The star has an effective temperature \\( T_{\\text{eff}} = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n   - Spots are \\( 1000 \\, \\text{K} \\) cooler, so \\( T_{\\text{spot}} = 5000 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n   - Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere: \\( 20\\% \\).\n\n2. **Flux When Spotted Hemisphere Faces Us**:\n   - Visible hemisphere area: \\( 2\\pi R^2 \\).\n   - \\( 20\\% \\) of this area is spots: \\( 0.2 \\times 2\\pi R^2 = 0.4\\pi R^2 \\).\n   - Remaining \\( 80\\% \\) is normal: \\( 1.6\\pi R^2 \\).\n   - Total flux from the visible hemisphere:\n     \\[\n     F_{\\text{spotted}} = (1.6\\pi R^2 \\cdot \\sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4\\pi R^2 \\cdot \\sigma (5000)^4)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Flux When Non-Spotted Hemisphere Faces Us**:\n   - Entire visible hemisphere is normal:\n     \\[\n     F_{\\text{non-spotted}} = 2\\pi R^2 \\cdot \\sigma (6000)^4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Fractional Amplitude**:\n   - The amplitude is the fractional decrease in flux:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Amplitude} = \\frac{F_{\\text{non-spotted}} - F_{\\text{spotted}}}{F_{\\text{non-spotted}}}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4\\right) \\approx 0.1035 \\, \\text{(or } 10.35\\%\\text{)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Exoplanet Transit Depth**:\n   - The transit depth is \\( \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}}\\right)^2 \\).\n   - Setting this equal to the amplitude:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}}\\right)^2 = 0.1035 \\implies \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.1035} \\approx 0.32\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \\( 0.32 \\), corresponding to **Option A**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{A}"

So the amplitude is ~10.35%, so the transit depth needed is 10.35%, so (R_pl/R_star)^2 = 0.1035, so R_pl/R_star \u2248 sqrt(0.1035) \u2248 0.3217, so ~0.32, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the options include 0.11 (B) and 0.07 (D). Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the filling factor. The problem says \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". Does that mean that 20% of the entire star's surface is covered in spots, but all on one hemisphere? Or does it mean that 20% of each hemisphere is covered?\n\nWait, the wording is \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the area covered on the surface where the feature is present. So if the entire hemisphere is the area in question, then 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. So that would mean 20% of half the star's surface, so 10% of the total surface area. But when the star rotates, the visible hemisphere alternates between the spotted and non-spotted. Therefore, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the visible hemisphere is spots, and 80% is normal. When the non-spotted is facing, 0% spots. So my previous calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filling factor is 20% over the entire star? But the problem says \"one hemisphere... filling factor of 20%\", so probably 20% of that hemisphere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the entire star's surface, so the total area covered by spots is 20% of the star's surface, all on one hemisphere. Then the area of the hemisphere is half the star's surface, so 20% of the star's surface would be 40% of the hemisphere. Wait, but that would be a filling factor of 40% on the hemisphere. The problem says filling factor is 20%, so that must be 20% of the hemisphere's area.\n\nTherefore, my original calculation is correct. So the amplitude is ~10%, so the planet radius ratio is sqrt(0.1035) ~0.32, so answer A.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A. ~0.32, B. ~0.11, C. ~0.39, D. ~0.07.\n\nHmm, so 0.32 is an option. But maybe I made a mistake in the temperature difference?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K\". So the spots are 1000K cooler, so 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K, which I used. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the average temperature of the star when spots are present? Wait, but the effective temperature given is already the Teff of the star, so that should already account for the spots? Wait, hold on, this is a crucial point.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K\". But if the star has spots, the effective temperature would actually be lower, because the spots emit less. However, the problem states that the star's Teff is 6000K, so perhaps that is the Teff of the unspotted star? Wait, the wording is ambiguous here.\n\nWait, let me read again: \"Astronomers are currently observing a star with a radius equal to that of the Sun. One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000K, and the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K.\"\n\nHmm, so the star's Teff is given as 6000K, but it has spots. So does that mean that the Teff already accounts for the spots? Or is the Teff the temperature of the non-spotted regions?\n\nThis is a critical point. If the Teff given is the effective temperature of the entire star (including spots), then the non-spotted regions must be hotter than 6000K to compensate for the cooler spots. Alternatively, if the Teff is the temperature of the non-spotted regions, then the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K, and the overall Teff of the star would be lower. But the problem states the star has Teff 6000K, so probably the Teff is the effective temperature of the entire star, considering the spots. Therefore, my previous approach is wrong because I assumed the non-spotted regions are at 6000K, but actually, the entire star's Teff is 6000K, so the non-spotted regions must be hotter to compensate for the cooler spots.\n\nOh no, this complicates things. Let me think again.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the star has two regions: spotted and non-spotted. The spotted regions have temperature T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K, and the non-spotted regions have a higher temperature T_non_spot. The effective temperature of the entire star is given as 6000 K. Therefore, we need to compute T_non_spot such that the average flux over the entire star's surface gives an effective temperature of 6000 K.\n\nWait, the effective temperature is defined such that the total flux from the star is \u03c3 Teff^4 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2. Therefore, the total flux must equal the sum of the flux from the spotted and non-spotted regions.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nTotal surface area of the star: 4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThe spotted area is 20% of one hemisphere, so 0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThe non-spotted area on the same hemisphere is 0.8*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) = 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThe other hemisphere has no spots, so its area is 2\u03c0R\u00b2, all at T_non_spot.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem says \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". So the other hemisphere has no spots. Therefore, the total spotted area is 0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2) = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2, and the non-spotted area on the spotted hemisphere is 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2, plus the entire other hemisphere (2\u03c0R\u00b2) which is non-spotted. Therefore, total non-spotted area is 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2 + 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the total flux from the star is:\n\nF_total = (Area_spots * \u03c3 T_spot^4) + (Area_non_spotted * \u03c3 T_non_spot^4)\n\nBut the effective temperature is given by F_total = \u03c3 Teff^4 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u03c3 [0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 T_spot^4 + 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2 T_non_spot^4] = \u03c3 Teff^4 *4\u03c0R\u00b2\n\nCancel out \u03c3 and \u03c0R\u00b2:\n\n0.4 T_spot^4 + 3.6 T_non_spot^4 = 4 Teff^4\n\nWe know Teff = 6000 K, T_spot = 5000 K (since the spots are 1000 K cooler). Wait, but hold on, if the spots are 1000 K cooler than the effective temperature? Or cooler than the non-spotted regions?\n\nThe problem says \"the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K\". The wording is ambiguous. Is the temperature difference between the spots and the effective temperature, or between the spots and the non-spotted regions?\n\nThis is another ambiguity. If the temperature difference is between the spots and the non-spotted regions, then T_spot = T_non_spot - 1000 K. If it's between spots and the effective temperature, then T_spot = Teff - 1000 K = 5000 K, but then we have to find T_non_spot such that the average gives Teff = 6000 K.\n\nThe problem says \"the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000K\". Since it's an astronomy context, usually the temperature difference of spots is relative to the surrounding photosphere (i.e., the non-spotted regions). So probably T_spot = T_non_spot - 1000 K.\n\nTherefore, let me define variables again with that in mind.\n\nLet T_non_spot be the temperature of the non-spotted regions (both on the spotted hemisphere and the non-spotted hemisphere). The spots have T_spot = T_non_spot - 1000 K.\n\nThe total flux is then:\n\nF_total = \u03c3 [ (Area_spots * T_spot^4) + (Area_non_spotted * T_non_spot^4) ]\n\n= \u03c3 [ (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)(T_non_spot - 1000)^4 + (3.6\u03c0R\u00b2)(T_non_spot)^4 ]\n\nSet equal to \u03c3 * Teff^4 *4\u03c0R\u00b2:\n\n0.4 (T_non_spot - 1000)^4 + 3.6 T_non_spot^4 = 4*(6000)^4\n\nThis equation allows us to solve for T_non_spot.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can approximate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the temperature difference is with respect to the effective temperature, so T_spot = Teff - 1000 = 5000 K, and the non-spotted regions are at Teff = 6000 K. But then the effective temperature of the star would not be 6000 K, unless the non-spotted regions compensate. Wait, but if the non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, then the average would be lower because of the spots. Therefore, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is intended to ignore the effect of the spots on the effective temperature, and just take the non-spotted regions as 6000 K, and the spots as 5000 K, even though that would make the star's actual effective temperature lower. Maybe the question is simplifying, assuming that the given Teff is the temperature of the non-spotted regions, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so we can proceed with that, even though strictly speaking the effective temperature would be different. Since the problem says \"the star has an effective temperature of 6000K\", perhaps we are to take that as the temperature of the non-spotted regions, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K, and the variation is calculated as before, ignoring the fact that the actual effective temperature would be lower. Maybe that's the intended approach here.\n\nGiven that the problem is from an exam, perhaps they expect the first approach where we take the non-spotted regions at 6000 K, spots at 5000 K, and compute the amplitude as 10%, leading to R_pl/R_star ~0.32, which is option A. But since the options include 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121), maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the area again. The filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible area is 2\u03c0R\u00b2, of which 20% is spots. So the area of spots in the visible hemisphere is 0.2 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2, and non-spotted is 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2. The total flux from the visible hemisphere when spotted side is facing us is:\n\nF_spotted_visible = (1.6\u03c0R\u00b2)(\u03c3*(6000)^4) + (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)(\u03c3*(5000)^4)\n\nThe flux when non-spotted side is facing is F_non_spotted_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2*(\u03c3*(6000)^4)\n\nTherefore, the difference in flux between the two is:\n\n\u0394F = F_non_spotted_visible - F_spotted_visible = [2\u03c0R\u00b2 - 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2]*(\u03c3*(6000)^4) - 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2*(\u03c3*(5000)^4)\n\nWait, actually, let me compute F_non_spotted_visible - F_spotted_visible:\n\nF_non_spotted_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4\n\nF_spotted_visible = 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 + 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5000)^4\n\nThus,\n\n\u0394F = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - [1.6\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 + 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5000)^4]\n\n= (2 - 1.6) \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5000)^4\n\n= 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (5000)^4\n\n= 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ]\n\nTherefore, the fractional amplitude is \u0394F / F_non_spotted_visible\n\nWhich is [0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / [2 \u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n0.4 / 2 * [ (6000^4 - 5000^4)/6000^4 ]\n\n= 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]\n\nSame as before, so 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4) \u2248 0.1035, so 10.35% amplitude.\n\nTherefore, the transit depth needed is 10.35%, so R_pl/R_star = sqrt(0.1035) \u2248 0.3217, so ~0.32, which is option A.\n\nBut the options have B as ~0.11. Hmm. Maybe the question is considering that the spots are on both hemispheres but with 20% filling factor? Wait, no, the problem says \"one hemisphere\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the filling factor is 20% over the entire star, so 10% on each hemisphere? But the problem says \"one hemisphere... filling factor of 20%\", so that's 20% of one hemisphere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the amplitude is half of what I calculated? Because the maximum variation is between the two states, but the average is somewhere in between, so the amplitude is the peak-to-peak divided by the average?\n\nWait, in my calculation, I took (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted, which is the maximum fractional decrease. However, the average flux over a rotation period would be the average of F_spotted and F_non_spotted, since the star spends half its time with each hemisphere facing us (assuming synchronous rotation or uniform rotation period). Therefore, the average flux is (F_spotted + F_non_spotted)/2.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude (peak-to-peak) is F_non_spotted - F_spotted, and the fractional amplitude relative to the average would be (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/[(F_spotted + F_non_spotted)/2] = 2*(F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/(F_spotted + F_non_spotted)\n\nWait, but in the case of the transit, the amplitude is the depth, which is (F_out - F_in)/F_out, which is the same as the fractional decrease. So if the question is asking for the same amplitude in the light curve, which is the depth (the minimum flux compared to the out-of-transit), then the spots' amplitude is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted, which is the same as the transit depth. Therefore, my original calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the amplitude as the peak-to-peak divided by the average, which would be different. Let me check:\n\nIf the average flux is (F_spotted + F_non_spotted)/2, then the amplitude (peak-to-peak) is F_non_spotted - F_spotted, so the fractional amplitude is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/[(F_spotted + F_non_spotted)/2] = 2*(F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/(F_spotted + F_non_spotted)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nF_non_spotted = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4\n\nF_spotted = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nTherefore,\n\nF_spotted + F_non_spotted = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 + (6000)^4] = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [1.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nF_non_spotted - F_spotted = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 (6000)^4 - 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4] = 2\u03c0R\u00b2 \u03c3 [0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nTherefore, the fractional amplitude (peak-to-peak over average) is:\n\n[2*(0.2*(6000)^4 - 0.2*(5000)^4)] / [1.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4]\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 0.4*(6000^4 - 5000^4)\n\nDenominator: 1.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4\n\nLet me factor out (6000)^4 from numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 0.4*(6000^4)*(1 - (5/6)^4 )\n\nDenominator: (6000)^4 [1.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 ]\n\nTherefore, the fractional amplitude becomes:\n\n[0.4*(1 - (5/6)^4 )] / [1.8 + 0.2*(5/6)^4 ]\n\nCompute (5/6)^4 \u2248 0.4823 as before.\n\nSo numerator: 0.4*(1 - 0.4823) \u2248 0.4*0.5177 \u2248 0.2071\n\nDenominator: 1.8 + 0.2*0.4823 \u2248 1.8 + 0.0965 \u2248 1.8965\n\nTherefore, fractional amplitude \u2248 0.2071 / 1.8965 \u2248 0.1092, so ~10.9%, which is still around 10%, so the transit depth would still be ~10%, leading to R_pl/R_star ~0.32.\n\nHmm, so even considering the average, it's still about 10%, so the answer should be A. But the options have B as 0.11, which is close to sqrt(0.0121)=0.11, but 0.32 squared is ~0.1, so maybe the question is considering something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the entire non-spotted hemisphere is at 6000 K. If the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, but the non-spotted regions are hotter to compensate for the cooler spots, then the actual temperature of the non-spotted regions would be higher, so the difference between the spots and the non-spotted regions is more than 1000 K?\n\nWait, let's try this approach again, considering that the effective temperature is 6000 K, so we have to compute T_non_spot such that the average gives Teff = 6000 K.\n\nLet me define variables again:\n\nLet T_spot = T_non_spot - 1000 K (since the temperature difference is 1000 K between spots and non-spotted regions).\n\nTotal flux:\n\nF_total = \u03c3 [0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 (T_non_spot - 1000)^4 + 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2 T_non_spot^4 ]\n\nSet equal to \u03c3 * Teff^4 *4\u03c0R\u00b2:\n\n0.4 (T_non_spot - 1000)^4 + 3.6 T_non_spot^4 = 4*(6000)^4\n\nLet me denote x = T_non_spot.\n\nThen,\n\n0.4 (x - 1000)^4 + 3.6 x^4 = 4*(6000)^4\n\nThis equation needs to be solved for x.\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which is complicated, but maybe we can approximate.\n\nLet me assume that x is close to 6000 K. Let me try x = 6000 K:\n\nLeft side: 0.4*(5000)^4 + 3.6*(6000)^4\n\nCompute (5000)^4 = (5/6 *6000)^4 = (5/6)^4*(6000)^4 \u2248 0.4823*(6000)^4\n\nThus,\n\n0.4*0.4823*(6000)^4 + 3.6*(6000)^4 \u2248 (0.1929 + 3.6)*(6000)^4 \u2248 3.7929*(6000)^4\n\nBut the right side is 4*(6000)^4, so 3.7929 < 4, so x needs to be higher to increase the left side.\n\nLet me try x = 6200 K.\n\nCompute (x - 1000) = 5200 K.\n\nCompute (5200)^4 / (6000)^4 = (52/60)^4 = (13/15)^4 \u2248 (0.8667)^4 \u2248 0.5625\n\nWait, 13/15 is ~0.8667, so (0.8667)^2 \u2248 0.75, then squared again is ~0.5625.\n\nThus,\n\n0.4*(5200)^4 + 3.6*(6200)^4 \u2248 0.4*0.5625*(6000)^4 + 3.6*( (62/60)^4 )*(6000)^4\n\nFirst term: 0.4*0.5625 = 0.225\n\nSecond term: 3.6*( (62/60)^4 )\n\n62/60 \u2248 1.0333, so (1.0333)^4 \u2248 approx 1.14 (since (1 + 0.0333)^4 \u2248 1 + 4*0.0333 + 6*(0.0333)^2 + ... \u2248 1 + 0.1332 + 0.0666 + ... \u2248 1.2). Let me compute more accurately:\n\n1.0333^2 = 1.0677, then squared again: 1.0677^2 \u2248 1.140, so yes, ~1.14.\n\nThus, second term: 3.6 * 1.14 \u2248 4.104\n\nTotal left side: 0.225 + 4.104 \u2248 4.329, multiplied by (6000)^4. The right side is 4*(6000)^4. So 4.329 > 4, so x=6200 gives left side too big.\n\nWe need to find x where left side =4.\n\nLet me try x=6100 K.\n\nThen x-1000=5100 K.\n\nCompute (5100/6000)^4 = (17/20)^4 = (0.85)^4 \u2248 0.522\n\n(6100/6000)^4 = (1.016666...)^4 \u2248 approx 1.068 (since (1.0167)^2 \u22481.0336, then squared again \u22481.068)\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term: 0.4 *0.522*(6000)^4 \u22480.2088*(6000)^4\n\nSecond term: 3.6*(1.068)*(6000)^4 \u22483.6*1.068\u22483.8448*(6000)^4\n\nTotal left side: (0.2088 + 3.8448)=4.0536*(6000)^4, which is still higher than 4.\n\nNeed x a bit lower.\n\nTry x=6050 K.\n\nx-1000=5050 K.\n\n(5050/6000)^4 = (1.01/1.2)^4? Wait, 5050/6000 = 0.841666...\n\n(0.841666)^4 \u2248 ?\n\n0.84^2 = 0.7056, then squared: ~0.7056^2 \u22480.4979\n\n0.841666^4 \u2248 approx 0.5.\n\n(6050/6000)^4 = (1.0083)^4 \u2248 approx 1.0336 (since (1.0083)^2\u22481.0167, then squared again\u22481.0336)\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term: 0.4 *0.5*(6000)^4 =0.2*(6000)^4\n\nSecond term: 3.6 *1.0336*(6000)^4 \u22483.721*(6000)^4\n\nTotal left side: 0.2 +3.721\u22483.921*(6000)^4 <4.\n\nSo between 6050 and 6100.\n\nLet me try x=6075 K.\n\nx-1000=5075 K.\n\n5075/6000\u22480.8458\n\n(0.8458)^4: Let's compute step by step.\n\n0.8458^2 \u22480.7154\n\nThen squared: 0.7154^2\u22480.5118\n\n(6075/6000)=1.0125\n\n(1.0125)^4: 1.0125^2\u22481.025156, then squared\u22481.051.\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term:0.4 *0.5118\u22480.2047\n\nSecond term:3.6 *1.051\u22483.7836\n\nTotal:0.2047+3.7836\u22483.9883*(6000)^4, still less than 4.\n\nNeed a bit higher x.\n\nTry x=6080 K.\n\nx-1000=5080 K.\n\n5080/6000\u22480.8467\n\n(0.8467)^4\u2248?\n\n0.8467^2\u22480.7168, then squared\u22480.5139\n\n(6080/6000)=1.0133\n\n(1.0133)^4\u2248?\n\n1.0133^2\u22481.0268, then squared\u22481.0544\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term:0.4*0.5139\u22480.2056\n\nSecond term:3.6*1.0544\u22483.8\n\nTotal\u22480.2056+3.8\u22484.0056*(6000)^4, which is very close to 4.0056\u22484.0056\u22484.0056, so x\u22486080 K.\n\nTherefore, T_non_spot\u22486080 K.\n\nTherefore, the non-spotted regions are at ~6080 K, and the spots are at 6080-1000=5080 K.\n\nTherefore, the temperature of the non-spotted regions is ~6080 K, spots ~5080 K.\n\nNow, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has 20% spots (at 5080 K) and 80% non-spotted (at 6080 K).\n\nThe flux from the visible hemisphere when spotted side is facing us is:\n\nF_spotted_visible = 0.8*(2\u03c0R\u00b2)*\u03c3*(6080)^4 + 0.2*(2\u03c0R\u00b2)*\u03c3*(5080)^4\n\nThe flux when non-spotted side is facing is F_non_spotted_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(6080)^4\n\nTherefore, the difference in flux is:\n\n\u0394F = F_non_spotted_visible - F_spotted_visible = [2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(6080)^4] - [0.8*2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(6080)^4 + 0.2*2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(5080)^4]\n\n= 2\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 [ (6080)^4 - 0.8*(6080)^4 -0.2*(5080)^4 ]\n\n= 2\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 [0.2*(6080)^4 -0.2*(5080)^4 ]\n\n= 0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 [ (6080)^4 - (5080)^4 ]\n\nThe fractional amplitude is \u0394F / F_non_spotted_visible:\n\n[0.4 \u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 (6080^4 -5080^4)] / [2\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3 (6080)^4 ]\n\n= 0.2 [1 - (5080/6080)^4 ]\n\nCompute (5080/6080) = 508/608 \u22480.836\n\n(0.836)^4 \u2248 ?\n\n0.836^2 \u22480.698896\n\nThen squared: ~0.698896^2 \u22480.488\n\nThus,\n\n1 -0.488\u22480.512\n\nMultiply by 0.2: 0.1024, so ~10.24%.\n\nSo even after correcting for the effective temperature, the fractional amplitude is still ~10%, leading to R_pl/R_star ~0.32.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut the options have B as 0.11. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the temperature?\n\nWait, when I calculated T_non_spot\u22486080 K, but let me check with x=6080:\n\nLeft side:\n\n0.4*(x-1000)^4 +3.6x^4 =0.4*(5080)^4 +3.6*(6080)^4\n\nLet me compute the ratio to (6000)^4:\n\nLet me compute (5080/6000)=0.8467, so (5080)^4=(0.8467)^4*(6000)^4\u22480.5139*(6000)^4\n\nSimilarly, (6080/6000)=1.0133, so (6080)^4\u2248(1.0133)^4*(6000)^4\u22481.0544*(6000)^4\n\nThus,\n\n0.4*0.5139 +3.6*1.0544 \u22480.2056 +3.7958\u22484.0014, which is very close to 4.0014\u22484.0014\u22484.0014, so yes, x=6080 K is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation holds. So the amplitude is ~10%, so the planet radius ratio is sqrt(0.1024)=0.32, so answer A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum divided by the maximum, which is what I did, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the spots are on both hemispheres but with 20% filling factor each? But the problem says \"one hemisphere\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the filling factor is 20% over the entire star, so 10% on each hemisphere? But the problem states \"one hemisphere... filling factor of 20%\", so that's 20% of one hemisphere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the temperature difference is 1000 K relative to the effective temperature, so spots are at 5000 K, and non-spotted regions are at 6000 K, even though that would make the effective temperature lower. If we proceed with that, then the amplitude is ~10%, leading to 0.32, which is answer A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the transit depth. The transit depth is (R_pl/R_star)^2, but if the planet is transiting, it's only covering a small part of the star, so the depth is indeed (R_pl/R_star)^2. So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the amplitude as the difference between the maximum and minimum divided by the average, which we calculated as ~10.9%, so sqrt(0.109)=0.33, still close to 0.32.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the filling factor is 20% of the entire star, so 10% on each hemisphere. Let me try that.\n\nIf the filling factor is 20% over the entire star, then total spotted area is 0.2*4\u03c0R\u00b2=0.8\u03c0R\u00b2. If distributed equally on both hemispheres, each hemisphere has 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 spots. Then when a hemisphere is facing us, the visible hemisphere has 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 spots and 1.6\u03c0R\u00b2 non-spotted.\n\nThen the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us would be:\n\nF_spotted_visible = (1.6\u03c0R\u00b2)*\u03c3*(6000)^4 + (0.4\u03c0R\u00b2)*\u03c3*(5000)^4\n\nF_non_spotted_visible = 2\u03c0R\u00b2*\u03c3*(6000)^4 (since the other hemisphere has 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 spots, but when the non-spotted side is facing, actually, no, if spots are on both hemispheres, then when any hemisphere is facing, it has 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 spots. Wait, if spots are distributed over the entire star with 20% filling factor, then each hemisphere has 10% spots. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nThe problem explicitly states \"one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%\". So it's 20% of one hemisphere, so my original calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A, 0.32. But since the options include B as 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121), maybe I made a mistake in the temperature difference?\n\nWait, if the temperature difference is 1000 K, but the spots are 1000 K cooler than the effective temperature, then T_spot = 5000 K, and non-spotted regions are at Teff =6000 K. Then the effective temperature of the star would actually be lower than 6000 K, but the problem says the star has Teff=6000 K. Therefore, this is impossible unless the non-spotted regions are hotter.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the one where we computed T_non_spot\u22486080 K, leading to the same ~10% amplitude. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum divided by the maximum, which is what I did, so 10%, so sqrt(0.1)=0.316, which rounds to 0.32, so A.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we compare the flux variations caused by the spots to those caused by a planet transit.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Spot Flux Calculation**:\n   - The star has an effective temperature \\( T_{\\text{eff}} = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n   - Spots are \\( 1000 \\, \\text{K} \\) cooler, so \\( T_{\\text{spot}} = 5000 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n   - Filling factor of spots on one hemisphere: \\( 20\\% \\).\n\n2. **Flux When Spotted Hemisphere Faces Us**:\n   - Visible hemisphere area: \\( 2\\pi R^2 \\).\n   - \\( 20\\% \\) of this area is spots: \\( 0.2 \\times 2\\pi R^2 = 0.4\\pi R^2 \\).\n   - Remaining \\( 80\\% \\) is normal: \\( 1.6\\pi R^2 \\).\n   - Total flux from the visible hemisphere:\n     \\[\n     F_{\\text{spotted}} = (1.6\\pi R^2 \\cdot \\sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4\\pi R^2 \\cdot \\sigma (5000)^4)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Flux When Non-Spotted Hemisphere Faces Us**:\n   - Entire visible hemisphere is normal:\n     \\[\n     F_{\\text{non-spotted}} = 2\\pi R^2 \\cdot \\sigma (6000)^4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Fractional Amplitude**:\n   - The amplitude is the fractional decrease in flux:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Amplitude} = \\frac{F_{\\text{non-spotted}} - F_{\\text{spotted}}}{F_{\\text{non-spotted}}}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Amplitude} = 0.2 \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{5000}{6000}\\right)^4\\right) \\approx 0.1035 \\, \\text{(or } 10.35\\%\\text{)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Exoplanet Transit Depth**:\n   - The transit depth is \\( \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}}\\right)^2 \\).\n   - Setting this equal to the amplitude:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}}\\right)^2 = 0.1035 \\implies \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.1035} \\approx 0.32\n     \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \\( 0.32 \\), corresponding to **Option A**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{A}",
