        "question": "Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime of 10^-9 sec and 10^-8 sec, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels.

        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which energy difference between two quantum states allows them to be clearly resolved, given their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The options are 10^-4 eV, 10^-9 eV, 10^-8 eV, and 10^-11 eV. Hmm, I remember something about energy-time uncertainty relation here. Let me think.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time are related by \u0394E \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2. Here, \u0394t would be the lifetime of the state, right? So each energy level has an uncertainty associated with its lifetime. To resolve two energy levels, their energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, maybe? Or perhaps larger than the individual uncertainties?\n\nWait, the problem says \"clearly distinguish\" which probably means that the natural linewidths (due to their finite lifetimes) should not overlap. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Let me confirm.\n\nThe energy uncertainty for each state is given by \u0394E \u2248 \u0127 / (2\u0394t). So for the first state with lifetime 10^-9 seconds, \u0394E1 \u2248 \u0127 / (2*10^-9 s). Similarly, for the second state with lifetime 10^-8 seconds, \u0394E2 \u2248 \u0127 / (2*10^-8 s). Then the total uncertainty would be the sum of these two? Or maybe the square root of the sum of squares? Hmm, not sure. But maybe since they are independent, the total linewidth is the sum of the individual linewidths. Or perhaps the convolution of the two Lorentzians? But maybe for simplicity, we can take the sum of the FWHM (full width at half maximum) as the total width.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties. But I think the proper way is that the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the linewidths. Let me check the formula.\n\nThe natural linewidth is given by \u0394E = \u0127 / \u03c4, where \u03c4 is the lifetime. So \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 and \u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42. Then the total linewidth would be \u0394E_total = \u0394E1 + \u0394E2? Or maybe sqrt((\u0394E1)^2 + (\u0394E2)^2) if they are independent? Hmm, I think when you have two Lorentzian distributions, the convolution would have a width that's the sum of the individual widths. Because Lorentzian convolutions add their widths. So if each energy level has a Lorentzian lineshape with width \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the total width when considering transitions between them would be \u0394E1 + \u0394E2. Therefore, to resolve the two energy levels, their energy separation \u0394E should be greater than \u0394E1 + \u0394E2.\n\nSo first, compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nBut let's compute \u0127 in eV\u00b7s. Planck's constant h is approximately 4.135667696\u00d710^-15 eV\u00b7s, so \u0127 = h/(2\u03c0) \u2248 6.582\u00d710^-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E1 = \u0127 / \u03c41 = (6.582\u00d710^-16 eV\u00b7s) / (10^-9 s) = 6.582\u00d710^-7 eV.\n\nSimilarly, \u0394E2 = \u0127 / \u03c42 = (6.582\u00d710^-16 eV\u00b7s) / (10^-8 s) = 6.582\u00d710^-8 eV.\n\nSo \u0394E1 \u2248 6.6\u00d710^-7 eV and \u0394E2 \u2248 6.6\u00d710^-8 eV. Then the sum \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 \u2248 7.26\u00d710^-7 eV. So the energy difference between the two states should be larger than this sum to be clearly resolved.\n\nLooking at the options: A. 10^-4 eV (which is 1e-4 eV), B. 1e-9 eV, C. 1e-8 eV, D. 1e-11 eV.\n\nSo 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 7.26e-7 eV. So that would be resolvable. The other options are smaller: 1e-9 is 0.000000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.26e-7, so not enough. Similarly, 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV, still smaller than 7.26e-7. 1e-11 is way smaller. So the only option that is larger than the sum of the uncertainties is A. 10^-4 eV.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The energy difference needs to be greater than the sum of the linewidths? Or maybe greater than the linewidth of each? Because if the energy difference is larger than the linewidth, then the peaks don't overlap. But if each energy level has its own linewidth, then the transition between them would have a linewidth that's the sum? Or maybe the problem is just that each energy level's uncertainty contributes to the uncertainty in the transition energy. So if you have two energy levels with uncertainties \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the uncertainty in the transition energy \u0394E_transition is sqrt(\u0394E1^2 + \u0394E2^2). So if the energy difference is greater than this, then they can be resolved.\n\nWait, but in spectroscopy, the linewidth of a transition is determined by the lifetimes of both the initial and final states. So if you have a transition from a state with lifetime \u03c41 to a state with lifetime \u03c42, the linewidth is \u0394E = \u0127*(1/\u03c41 + 1/\u03c42). So the total linewidth would be the sum of the reciprocal lifetimes scaled by \u0127.\n\nBut in this problem, are we considering transitions between E1 and E2, or just the energy levels themselves? The question states \"two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have a lifetime...\", so maybe each energy level has a certain linewidth due to its lifetime. So the uncertainty in E1 is \u0394E1 = \u0127/\u03c41, and uncertainty in E2 is \u0394E2 = \u0127/\u03c42. Then, the total uncertainty when measuring the energy difference would be sqrt(\u0394E1^2 + \u0394E2^2) if they are independent. But if the energy levels are independent, then their uncertainties are independent, so the uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt(\u0394E1^2 + \u0394E2^2). Therefore, to resolve the energy difference, the separation \u0394E = |E1 - E2| should be greater than this uncertainty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the linewidths add directly. If you have two peaks each with a certain width, the separation between them needs to be larger than their widths to resolve. So if each peak has a width \u0394E1 and \u0394E2, then the total width is something like \u0394E1 + \u0394E2, and the separation should be greater than that. But I think in terms of the Rayleigh criterion for resolution, two peaks are resolvable if their separation is greater than the sum of their half-widths. But I need to recall.\n\nIn optics, the Rayleigh criterion states that two point sources are resolvable if the peak of one is at least as far as the first minimum of the other. For a diffraction-limited system, this corresponds to a separation of about the width of the point spread function. But for Lorentzian or Gaussian line shapes, the criterion is different. For Lorentzian, which has broader tails, the separation required is more. But perhaps in this context, the question is simplifying it to requiring the energy difference to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy of either state. But since the lifetimes are different, the uncertainties are different. So if \u0394E1 \u2248 6.6e-7 eV and \u0394E2 \u2248 6.6e-8 eV, then the larger uncertainty is 6.6e-7 eV. So if the energy difference is larger than that, maybe it's resolvable. But the sum is 7.26e-7 eV, which is a bit larger. So depending on the criterion.\n\nBut given the options, 1e-4 eV is much larger than 7.26e-7 eV. So 1e-4 eV is 100 times larger than the sum. So definitely resolvable. The other options are smaller than the sum. So answer A.\n\nBut wait, let me check the calculation again. Let's compute \u0394E1 and \u0394E2.\n\nGiven \u03c41 = 1e-9 s, \u03c42 = 1e-8 s.\n\n\u0394E = \u0127 / \u03c4.\n\n\u0127 = 6.582e-16 eV\u00b7s.\n\nSo \u0394E1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.\n\n\u0394E2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.\n\nSum \u0394E1 + \u0394E2 = 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV \u2248 7.24e-7 eV.\n\nSo the energy difference needs to be greater than ~7.24e-7 eV to be resolvable.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1e-4 eV = 1e-4 eV = 1000e-7 eV, which is way larger.\n\nB. 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-6 eV, way smaller.\n\nC. 1e-8 eV = 0.01e-6 eV, still smaller.\n\nD. 1e-11 eV = 0.00001e-6 eV, even smaller.\n\nSo only option A is larger than 7.24e-7 eV. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"clearly distinguish these two energy levels\". So maybe the energy difference should be several times the linewidth? But since the options don't give us multiples, just orders of magnitude, and 1e-4 eV is three orders of magnitude larger than the sum, which is definitely enough. So answer A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the energy-time uncertainty principle, where \u0394E \u2248 \u0127/\u0394t. But here, \u0394t is the lifetime. So the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So shorter lifetime (1e-9 s) corresponds to larger energy uncertainty (\u0394E1 \u2248 6.6e-7 eV), longer lifetime (1e-8 s) corresponds to smaller energy uncertainty (\u0394E2 \u2248 6.6e-8 eV). So the energy levels have widths \u0394E1 and \u0394E2. To resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than the widths. So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than both widths, then yes, they can be resolved. If the energy difference is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than \u0394E1, then they cannot be resolved. So answer A.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is A. 10^-4 eV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
