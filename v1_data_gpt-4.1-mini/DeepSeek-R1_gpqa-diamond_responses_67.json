        "question": "There is a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu (= gamma*Sz), aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction; both fields have the same magnitude, B. The average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating. What is its oscillation frequency?\nA. gamma*B/sqrt(2)\nB. gamma*B/2\nC. gamma*B\nD. sqrt(2)*gamma*B",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after the magnetic field is switched from the +Z direction to the +Y direction. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments.\n\nFirst, the magnetic moment \u03bc is given by \u03b3 times the spin operator Sz. Initially, the particle is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction. That probably means the particle is in the spin-up state along Z, right? So its initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. The magnetic moment is \u03bc = \u03b3\u27e8Sz\u27e9, and since it's aligned with the field, \u27e8Sz\u27e9 should be \u0127/2 initially. But maybe the actual value isn't important here; the question is about the oscillation frequency after the field changes.\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly turned off in the Z direction and turned on in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. So initially, the Hamiltonian was H_initial = -\u03b3 B S_z. Then, after switching, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -\u03b3 B S_y.\n\nThe particle starts in the eigenstate of S_z, which is |\u2191z\u27e9. When the magnetic field direction changes to Y, the Hamiltonian is now proportional to S_y. The state |\u2191z\u27e9 is not an eigenstate of S_y, so the particle will start to evolve under the new Hamiltonian. This time evolution will cause oscillations in the expectation values of observables that don't commute with the Hamiltonian, such as S_z.\n\nThe question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment. The oscillation frequency is related to the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian is now H = -\u03b3 B S_y, the energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y for a spin-1/2 particle are \u00b1\u0127/2. Therefore, the energy difference between the two eigenstates is \u0394E = \u0127 \u03b3 B (since E = -\u03b3 B S_y, so the difference is (-\u03b3 B (-\u0127/2)) - (-\u03b3 B (\u0127/2)) ) = \u03b3 B \u0127/2 + \u03b3 B \u0127/2 = \u03b3 B \u0127). Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, the eigenvalues of S_y are \u00b1\u0127/2. So the corresponding energies are E_+ = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) and E_- = -\u03b3 B (-\u0127/2) = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2). Therefore, the energy difference \u0394E = E_+ - E_- = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2) - \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) = -\u03b3 B \u0127. But the magnitude is \u03b3 B \u0127. The oscillation frequency is given by \u0394E / \u0127, so that would be \u03b3 B \u0127 / \u0127 = \u03b3 B. Hmm, so the frequency would be \u03b3 B? But let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using time evolution. The state |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 will evolve under the new Hamiltonian H = -\u03b3 B S_y. The time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / \u0127). So substituting H, we get U(t) = exp(i \u03b3 B S_y t / \u0127). The initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. Let me express |\u2191z\u27e9 in terms of the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nThe eigenstates of S_y can be written as |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9, which are superpositions of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9. Specifically, |\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 and |\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2. Therefore, the initial state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be written as a combination of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9:\n\n|\u2191z\u27e9 = (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nThen, under the time evolution, each component will pick up a phase factor. The state at time t is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = (exp(i \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) t / \u0127) |\u2191y\u27e9 + exp(i \u03b3 B (-\u0127/2) t / \u0127) |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSimplifying the exponents:\n\nexp(i \u03b3 B (\u0127/2) t / \u0127) = exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2),\nexp(i \u03b3 B (-\u0127/2) t / \u0127) = exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nTherefore,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2191y\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2193y\u27e9]/\u221a2.\n\nNow, let's express this back in terms of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] / \u221a2.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nFirst, factor out 1/\u221a2 from each term inside the brackets:\n\n= [ (exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)) / \u221a2 ] / \u221a2\n\n= [ exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9) ] / (\u221a2 * \u221a2)\n\n= [ exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2191z\u27e9 + exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) i|\u2193z\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2191z\u27e9 - exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) i|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / 2\n\nCombine like terms for |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\nFor |\u2191z\u27e9:\n\n[ exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) ] / 2 |\u2191z\u27e9\n\nFor |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n[ i exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) - i exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) ] / 2 |\u2193z\u27e9\n\nSimplify using Euler's formula:\n\ncos(\u03b8) = [ exp(i\u03b8) + exp(-i\u03b8) ] / 2\n\nsin(\u03b8) = [ exp(i\u03b8) - exp(-i\u03b8) ] / (2i)\n\nSo,\n\nFor |\u2191z\u27e9:\n\ncos(\u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2191z\u27e9\n\nFor |\u2193z\u27e9:\n\n[ i (exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) - exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)) ] / 2 |\u2193z\u27e9\n\n= [ i * 2i sin(\u03b3 B t / 2) ] / 2 |\u2193z\u27e9\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\ni [ exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) - exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) ] / 2\n\n= i [ 2i sin(\u03b3 B t / 2) ] / 2\n\n= (i * 2i sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)) / 2\n\n= ( -2 sin(\u03b3 B t / 2) ) / 2\n\n= - sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)\n\nTherefore, the state simplifies to:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos(\u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2191z\u27e9 - sin(\u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2193z\u27e9\n\nNow, to find the expectation value of S_z, which is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| S_z |\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nS_z has eigenvalues \u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 for |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9 respectively. So,\n\n\u27e8S_z\u27e9 = |cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)|^2 (\u0127/2) + |sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)|^2 (-\u0127/2)\n\n= [ cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2) - sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2) ] (\u0127/2)\n\nUsing the double-angle identity cos(2\u03b8) = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\n= cos(\u03b3 B t) (\u0127/2)\n\nTherefore, the average z-component of the magnetic moment is \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 \u27e8S_z\u27e9 = \u03b3 * (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t)\n\nSo the oscillation is cos(\u03b3 B t), which has a frequency of \u03b3 B / (2\u03c0). But wait, the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is usually given as angular frequency \u03c9 divided by 2\u03c0. However, in physics, sometimes we just refer to angular frequency as frequency. Let me check.\n\nThe time dependence is cos(\u03b3 B t), so the angular frequency \u03c9 is \u03b3 B. Therefore, the frequency f is \u03c9 / (2\u03c0) = \u03b3 B / (2\u03c0). But the answer choices are given in terms of angular frequency, I think. Because the options are gamma*B, etc., without a 2pi. So the oscillation frequency, in terms of angular frequency, is gamma*B. Therefore, the answer should be C. gamma*B.\n\nWait, but let me verify again. The expectation value oscillates as cos(\u03b3 B t), so the angular frequency is \u03b3 B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma*B. So answer C.\n\nBut let me check again with another approach. The energy levels when the field is along Y are E = \u00b1 (\u03b3 B \u0127)/2. The difference is \u0394E = \u03b3 B \u0127. The frequency of oscillation between the states is \u0394E / \u0127 = gamma B. So that's consistent. So Rabi frequency is \u0394E / \u0127, which is gamma B. Therefore, the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So answer C.\n\nAlternatively, think about Larmor frequency. When a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it precesses with the Larmor frequency \u03c9 = gamma B. But in this case, the field is along Y, and we're looking at the z-component oscillating. The precession around Y would cause the z-component to oscillate with frequency equal to the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. So that also points to answer C.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. gamma*B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}"
