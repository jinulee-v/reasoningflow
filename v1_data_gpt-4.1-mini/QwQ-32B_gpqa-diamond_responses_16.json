        "question": "What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex (we assume that the pH is ideal, T = 25 \u00b0C). KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10.\nA. 6.3x10^-7 M\nB. 2.0x10^-2 M\nC. 5.0x10^-3 M\nD. 1.0x10^-2 M",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has a 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The problem states that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25\u00b0C, and the formation constant (K) for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex means. I think that means the solution is made by mixing calcium ions and EDTA in a 1:1 molar ratio, so all the calcium is complexed with EDTA. But wait, actually, stoichiometric might just mean that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so maybe the total concentration of calcium and EDTA is such that their complex forms 0.02 M? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, the question says \"a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex\". So perhaps the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. Since EDTA forms a 1:1 complex with Ca\u00b2+, the stoichiometry is 1 Ca\u00b2+ to 1 EDTA. So the complex is CaY\u00b2\u207b, where Y\u2074\u207b is EDTA. \n\nThe formation constant K is given as 5x10^10. The formation constant expression for the reaction Ca\u00b2+ + Y\u2074\u207b \u21cc CaY\u00b2\u207b is K = [CaY\u00b2\u207b]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y\u2074\u207b]). \n\nSince the solution contains 0.02 M CaY\u00b2\u207b, we can use the formation constant to find the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ ions. But to do that, I need to know the concentration of free EDTA as well. Wait, but if the solution is stoichiometric, that might mean that all the EDTA is complexed with Ca\u00b2+, so the free EDTA concentration is negligible? Hmm, but that might not be the case because the formation constant is very large, so the complex is very stable, so maybe the free Ca\u00b2+ is very low. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the stoichiometric solution implies that the initial concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA were equal, so that they form the complex completely? But in reality, even if they are stoichiometric, there will be some dissociation because K is finite, even though it's very large. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Since the concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M, and the formation constant is K = 5e10, then we can rearrange the formation constant expression to solve for [Ca\u00b2+]. \n\nLet me write the expression again:\n\nK = [CaY\u00b2\u207b]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y\u2074\u207b])\n\nBut if the solution is stoichiometric, then the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA would be such that they are in a 1:1 ratio. However, since the complex is formed, the free concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y\u2074\u207b would be very low. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the EDTA is in excess, but the question says \"stoichiometric\", so perhaps the EDTA and Ca\u00b2+ were mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ initially would be 0.02 M, and EDTA also 0.02 M, but they form the complex. However, due to the formation constant, some of them will dissociate. \n\nWait, but if the solution is stoichiometric, then the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ (free plus complexed) is equal to the total EDTA (free plus complexed). Since they are in 1:1 ratio, the total Ca\u00b2+ is equal to total EDTA. \n\nLet me denote the concentration of free Ca\u00b2+ as x. Then, the concentration of free EDTA (Y\u2074\u207b) would also be x, because the complexation is 1:1. The concentration of the complex [CaY\u00b2\u207b] would then be 0.02 M minus the amount that dissociated. Wait, but actually, the total concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is stating that the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M, so [CaY\u00b2\u207b] = 0.02 M. Then, using the formation constant, we can find [Ca\u00b2+] and [Y\u2074\u207b]. Since K is very large, the free concentrations of Ca\u00b2+ and Y\u2074\u207b should be very small. \n\nLet me set up the equation. Let\u2019s let [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y\u2074\u207b] = x. Then, according to the formation constant:\n\nK = [CaY\u00b2\u207b]/([Ca\u00b2+][Y\u2074\u207b]) = (0.02)/(x * x) = 0.02 / x\u00b2 = 5e10\n\nSo solving for x\u00b2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 4e-12 / 1e1 = 4e-13? Wait, 0.02 divided by 5e10 is 0.02/(5*10^10) = (2*10^-2)/(5*10^10) = (2/5)*10^-12 = 0.4*10^-12 = 4e-13. \n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 = 4e-13, so x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7, but 2*3.16e-7 is ~6.3e-7. \n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(4e-13):\n\nsqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.3e-7. \n\nTherefore, [Ca\u00b2+] = 6.3e-7 M, which is option A. \n\nHmm, so that seems straightforward. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The formation constant is 5e10. \n\nAssuming that the free Ca\u00b2+ and EDTA concentrations are equal (since they are in a 1:1 ratio and the complex is the only product), then K = [CaY]/([Ca][Y]) = 5e10. \n\nSo rearranged, [Ca] = [Y] = sqrt([CaY]/K) = sqrt(0.02 / 5e10). \n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.02 / 5e10 = 0.004 / 1e10 = 4e-3 / 1e10 = 4e-13. \n\nSquare root of 4e-13 is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 1e-6.5. Since 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 is ~6.3e-7. \n\nTherefore, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me think again if there's another way. Suppose the stoichiometric solution implies that the total concentration of Ca\u00b2+ is 0.02 M, and all of it is complexed except for a small amount. But in that case, the total [Ca\u00b2+] would be 0.02 M, but actually, the complex is 0.02 M, so the free Ca\u00b2+ is negligible? But according to the calculation, it's 6.3e-7, which is very small compared to 0.02, so that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the total concentration of EDTA and calcium is 0.02 M each, but that would complicate things. But the question says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so I think the complex itself is 0.02 M. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 6.3x10^-7 M. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option A is 6.3e-7, which matches my calculation. So that's probably the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming [Ca\u00b2+] = [Y\u2074\u207b]. Let me see. The reaction is Ca\u00b2+ + Y\u2074\u207b \u21cc CaY\u00b2\u207b. So the stoichiometry is 1:1, so yes, the free concentrations should be equal. \n\nAlternatively, if the EDTA had other charges, but since the problem states pH is ideal, so EDTA is fully deprotonated as Y\u2074\u207b, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nThe concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex can be determined using the formation constant (\\(K\\)) expression. \n\nThe reaction is:  \n\\[\n\\text{Ca}^{2+} + \\text{Y}^{4-} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CaY}^{2-}\n\\]  \nwith the formation constant given by:  \n\\[\nK = \\frac{[\\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\\text{Ca}^{2+}][\\text{Y}^{4-}]} = 5 \\times 10^{10}.\n\\]\n\nGiven that the concentration of the complex \\([\\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \\, \\text{M}\\), we assume the free concentrations of \\(\\text{Ca}^{2+}\\) and \\(\\text{Y}^{4-}\\) are equal (\\([\\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\\text{Y}^{4-}] = x\\)). Substituting into the \\(K\\) expression:  \n\\[\n5 \\times 10^{10} = \\frac{0.02}{x^2}.\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):  \n\\[\nx^2 = \\frac{0.02}{5 \\times 10^{10}} = 4 \\times 10^{-13},  \n\\]  \n\\[\nx = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-13}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6.5} \\approx 6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the concentration of free calcium ions is **\\(6.3 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{M}\\)**, corresponding to **Option A**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{A}"
