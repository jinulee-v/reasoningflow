You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus.

        "response": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a transgenic mouse model where they tried to overexpress GADD45G with an HA tag, but it's not working. The user provided the DNA sequence of the construct's plus strand and four possible reasons why the protein isn't being expressed as expected. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should recall that when you introduce a tag like HA (from influenza hemagglutinin), you usually add it to the N-terminus. The HA tag sequence is part of the coding sequence. The problem mentions that the HA antigenic determinant is at the N-terminus. So maybe there's an issue with how the HA tag is incorporated into the DNA sequence.\n\nLooking at the options, A says the lack of a linker causes proteolysis. B says the ribosome terminated early. C is about the tRNA for UAA not existing, but UAA is a stop codon, so maybe a premature stop? D is a missense mutation in the HA sequence.\n\nWait, the key here is probably the DNA sequence provided. Let me check if there's a premature stop codon in the mRNA. Since the DNA is given as the plus strand (coding strand), the mRNA would be complementary. Let me transcribe the DNA to mRNA and look for stop codons.\n\nStarting from the beginning of the DNA sequence:\n\nThe first few bases are 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TG... \n\nTranscribed mRNA would be:\n\nAUG UAC CCA UAC GAU GUU CCA GAU UAC GCC AAA UG...\n\nWait, let's go step by step. The DNA is the coding strand, so mRNA is complementary and in the same direction. So each DNA base is transcribed to mRNA as:\n\nDNA: A \u2192 U\n\nT \u2192 A\n\nG \u2192 C\n\nC \u2192 G\n\nSo the first codon is ATG \u2192 AUG (start codon). Then TAC \u2192 UAC, which is Tyr. Then CCA \u2192 CCA (Pro), etc. \n\nBut I need to look for a premature stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA. Let me scan through the DNA sequence for the triplet that would code for a stop codon in the mRNA.\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence, let's check for TAA, TAG, or TGA (since mRNA stop codons are UAA, UAG, UGA, so DNA would be TAA, TAG, TGA on the coding strand).\n\nLooking through the DNA sequence provided:\n\nStarting from the beginning, let's go through the sequence in triplets:\n\nFirst triplet: ATG (start, so AUG in mRNA)\n\nSecond: TAC \u2192 UAC (Tyr)\n\nThird: CCA \u2192 CCA (Pro)\n\nFourth: TAC \u2192 UAC (Tyr)\n\nFifth: GAT \u2192 GAU (Asp)\n\nSixth: GTT \u2192 GUA (Val)\n\nSeventh: CCA \u2192 CCA (Pro)\n\nEighth: GAT \u2192 GAU (Asp)\n\nNinth: TAC \u2192 UAC (Tyr)\n\nTenth: GCC \u2192 GCC (Ala)\n\nEleventh: AAA \u2192 AAA (Lys)\n\nTwelfth: TGA \u2192 TGA \u2192 which is a stop codon in DNA (since mRNA would be UGA). Wait, here's a TGA in the DNA. So that would be a stop codon in the mRNA. \n\nWait, so at the 12th codon (positions 33-35 of the DNA sequence?), the DNA triplet is TGA, which would transcribe to UGA in mRNA, a stop codon. That would terminate translation early. \n\nSo the ribosome would stop at that TGA, leading to a truncated protein. That would explain why they can't overexpress the protein. The construct has a premature stop codon, so the protein isn't made properly. \n\nLooking at the options, B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be correct. \n\nBut let me check further to make sure there's no other issues. Let me confirm the exact position. Let's count the nucleotides:\n\nThe DNA sequence given is a long string. Let me parse it in triplets:\n\nStarting from the 5' end:\n\n1-3: ATG (start)\n\n4-6: TAC\n\n7-9: CCA\n\n10-12: TAC\n\n13-15: GAT\n\n16-18: GTT\n\n19-21: CCA\n\n22-24: GAT\n\n25-27: TAC\n\n28-30: GCC\n\n31-33: AAA\n\n34-36: TGA\n\nAh, so the 12th codon (positions 34-36) is TGA. So that's a stop codon. So the mRNA would have UGA here, which is a stop. So the ribosome would terminate translation here, leading to a truncated protein. Hence, the protein isn't expressed properly. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. But UAA is a stop codon, not an amino acid. The tRNA for stop codons are release factors, not tRNAs. So C is incorrect. \n\nOption D is a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But the problem is a premature stop, not a missense. \n\nOption A is about proteolysis due to lack of linker. If the HA tag is fused without a linker, maybe the protein is unstable, but the immediate issue here is that the protein isn't even being made because translation stops early. So the main problem is the premature stop codon. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is **B. The ribosome terminated the translation early**.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe provided DNA sequence of the construct's plus strand contains a premature stop codon. To identify this, we transcribe the DNA into mRNA (complementary to the DNA strand) and analyze for stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA). \n\nKey steps:\n1. **Transcription**: The DNA sequence is the coding strand, so the mRNA is synthesized as:\n   - DNA: `...AAA TGA...` (positions 31-36)\n   - mRNA: `...AAA UGA...` (since DNA T becomes U in mRNA).\n\n2. **Stop Codon Identification**: The triplet `TGA` in the DNA corresponds to `UGA` in the mRNA, which is a stop codon. This occurs at the 12th codon (positions 34-36 of the DNA sequence), far before the expected end of the GADD45G coding sequence.\n\n3. **Consequence**: The ribosome encounters this premature stop codon and terminates translation early, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein. This explains the inability to overexpress the protein as intended.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n- **A. Lack of linker causing proteolysis**: While a missing linker might affect protein stability, the primary issue here is premature termination of translation, not post-translational degradation.\n- **C. tRNA for UAA does not exist**: UAA is a stop codon, not an amino acid, so no tRNA is involved. Release factors, not tRNAs, recognize stop codons.\n- **D. Missense mutation in HA sequence**: The HA tag sequence itself is not the problem. The premature stop codon occurs downstream of the HA tag, truncating the entire protein.\n\nThe critical issue is the **premature stop codon** in the mRNA, leading to early termination of translation. This directly explains the failure to overexpress the protein. \n\n**Answer: B**"
