        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator given by H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, where \u03b5 is an energy constant, \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. The options are A through D, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about Pauli matrices and Hamiltonians.\n\nFirst, the Pauli spin matrices, \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z, are 2x2 matrices that represent the spin operators in quantum mechanics. Each of them has eigenvalues +1 and -1 when acting on spin states. But here, the Hamiltonian is given as the dot product of \u03c3 and a unit vector n, scaled by \u03b5. So H = \u03b5 (\u03c3\u00b7n). \n\nI remember that for a Hamiltonian of the form H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, the eigenvalues can be found by recognizing that \u03c3\u00b7n is a vector operator, and when you take the dot product with a unit vector, it's essentially projecting the spin onto that direction. The eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n itself should be related to the eigenvalues of the individual Pauli matrices. Since each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \u00b11, then the operator \u03c3\u00b7n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices with coefficients n_x, n_y, n_z, should have eigenvalues that depend on the direction of n. Wait, but actually, maybe not? Let me think again.\n\nHmm, actually, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their linear combination \u03c3\u00b7n is also Hermitian. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real. Now, the operator \u03c3\u00b7n is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of such an operator can be found by calculating the trace and determinant. Let me recall that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are (Tr \u00b1 sqrt(Tr\u00b2 - 4 Det))/2. \n\nLet me compute the trace and determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n. The trace of \u03c3\u00b7n is the sum of the traces of each component. But each Pauli matrix has trace zero. For example, Tr(\u03c3_x) = 0, Tr(\u03c3_y)=0, Tr(\u03c3_z)=0. Therefore, Tr(\u03c3\u00b7n) = n_x Tr(\u03c3_x) + n_y Tr(\u03c3_y) + n_z Tr(\u03c3_z) = 0. So the trace is zero. \n\nNow the determinant. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix M is (M_{11}M_{22} - M_{12}M_{21}). Let me write out \u03c3\u00b7n explicitly. Let's suppose n is (n_x, n_y, n_z). Then \u03c3\u00b7n = n_x \u03c3_x + n_y \u03c3_y + n_z \u03c3_z. Let me write each Pauli matrix:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nTherefore, \u03c3\u00b7n would be:\n\nn_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_y * [[0,-i],[i,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nSo adding these up:\n\nThe (1,1) component is n_z * 1 + n_x*0 + n_y*0 = n_z\n\nThe (1,2) component is n_x*1 + n_y*(-i) + n_z*0 = n_x - i n_y\n\nThe (2,1) component is n_x*1 + n_y*(i) + n_z*0 = n_x + i n_y\n\nThe (2,2) component is -n_z + n_x*0 + n_y*0 = -n_z\n\nTherefore, the matrix \u03c3\u00b7n is:\n\n[ [n_z, n_x - i n_y],\n  [n_x + i n_y, -n_z] ]\n\nNow, determinant of this matrix is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst term: -n_z\u00b2\n\nSecond term: -(n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = -[n_x\u00b2 + i n_x n_y - i n_x n_y -i\u00b2 n_y\u00b2] = -[n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2] because i\u00b2 = -1, so the cross terms cancel and the last term becomes +n_y\u00b2.\n\nTherefore determinant is -n_z\u00b2 - (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2) = - (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) = - (n\u00b7n). But since n is a unit vector, n\u00b7n =1. Therefore determinant is -1.\n\nSo determinant of \u03c3\u00b7n is -1. \n\nNow, going back to the eigenvalues formula for a 2x2 matrix with trace Tr and determinant Det:\n\nEigenvalues are [Tr \u00b1 sqrt(Tr\u00b2 - 4 Det)] / 2\n\nBut here Tr is 0, so eigenvalues are [0 \u00b1 sqrt(0 - 4*(-1))]/2 = [\u00b1 sqrt(4)] /2 = \u00b1 2/2 = \u00b11.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are +1 and -1. \n\nBut the Hamiltonian is H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, so the eigenvalues of H would be \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H are \u03b5*(+1) and \u03b5*(-1), so +\u03b5 and -\u03b5. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option C: +\u03b5, -\u03b5. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think of another way. Since \u03c3\u00b7n is a unit vector direction, the operator \u03c3\u00b7n is like the spin operator in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle are \u00b1\u0127/2. Wait, hold on, maybe I forgot a factor here?\n\nWait, hold on. The Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z are dimensionless, right? But in the actual spin operator, the spin angular momentum operator S is given by (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So maybe the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b11, but when you have the actual spin operator, which is (\u0127/2) \u03c3\u00b7n, then the eigenvalues would be \u00b1\u0127/2. \n\nBut in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n. So unless \u03b5 already includes the \u0127/2 factor, but the problem states that \u03b5 is a constant of dimension energy. Hmm. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n. Here, n is an arbitrary unit vector, \u03b5 is a constant of dimension energy, and components of \u03c3 are the Pauli spin matrices.\" So the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, so the units of H must be energy. Since \u03c3\u00b7n is dimensionless, then \u03b5 must have units of energy, so that H has units of energy. Therefore, the eigenvalues of H will be \u03b5 times the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n. Since \u03c3\u00b7n has eigenvalues \u00b11, then H has eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. Therefore, the answer is C. \n\nBut let me think again. Wait, in standard terms, the Hamiltonian for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, where \u03bc is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator, which is (\u0127/2) \u03c3. So if B is along some direction, then H would be proportional to \u03c3\u00b7n, but with a coefficient that includes \u0127. However, in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n, so the coefficient \u03b5 is already encompassing all the constants needed to make the units correct. Since \u03b5 is given as a constant with dimension energy, then the eigenvalues are just \u00b1\u03b5. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. +\u0127/2, -\u0127/2 \u2192 These would be eigenvalues if the Hamiltonian was (\u0127/2) \u03c3\u00b7n, but here it's \u03b5 \u03c3\u00b7n.\n\nB. +\u03b5 \u0127/2, - \u03b5 \u0127/2 \u2192 This would be if there was an extra factor of \u0127/2, but the problem states H is \u03b5 times \u03c3\u00b7n, so unless \u03b5 already includes that, but since \u03b5 is given as energy, then no.\n\nC. +\u03b5, -\u03b5 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\n\nD. +1, -1 \u2192 These are eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n, but scaled by \u03b5 in H, so H's eigenvalues are scaled by \u03b5.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but let me think once more. Suppose someone might think that the eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b11, so when multiplied by \u03b5, they become \u00b1\u03b5. So yes, that's exactly what we did. So I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the determinant? Let me recalculate the determinant quickly. The matrix \u03c3\u00b7n is:\n\n[ n_z , n_x - i n_y ]\n\n[ n_x + i n_y , -n_z ]\n\nSo determinant is (n_z)(-n_z) - (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = -n_z\u00b2 - [n_x\u00b2 + (n_y)^2] because (a - ib)(a + ib) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2. Wait, actually, (n_x - i n_y)(n_x + i n_y) = n_x\u00b2 + (i n_y)(-i n_y) + ... Wait, expanding it:\n\n(n_x)^2 + n_x(i n_y) - i n_y n_x - i^2 (n_y)^2. The cross terms cancel because they are +i n_x n_y and -i n_x n_y. Then the last term is -i\u00b2 n_y\u00b2 = -(-1)n_y\u00b2 = +n_y\u00b2. So total is n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2. Therefore determinant is -n_z\u00b2 - (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2) = - (n_x\u00b2 + n_y\u00b2 + n_z\u00b2) = -1. So that's correct. Therefore eigenvalues of \u03c3\u00b7n are \u00b11. So H has eigenvalues \u00b1\u03b5. So answer C is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C.\n</think>\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given by \\( H = \\varepsilon \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{n} \\), where \\( \\vec{\\sigma} \\) are the Pauli matrices and \\( \\vec{n} \\) is a unit vector.
