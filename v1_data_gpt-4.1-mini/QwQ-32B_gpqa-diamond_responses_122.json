From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60 000 km/s (sixty thousand kilometers per second) towards it.\nWhat distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?\n\n(Note: Gravity can be ignored, and rotation and revolution of the Galaxy can be ignored.)\nA. 3 060 000 km.\nB. 2 940 000 km.\nC. 3 000 000 km.\nD. 2 880 000 km.",
        "response": "Okay, so there's this problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. The question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's own reference frame. The given speed is 60,000 km/s from the ejecta's perspective. Hmm, since they're both inertial frames, I think we need to use special relativity here because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me check: 60,000 km/s is 6% of the speed of light (since c is about 300,000 km/s). So maybe relativistic effects are noticeable but not too extreme. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the time dilation formula. In special relativity, the time experienced in one frame (proper time) is related to the time in another frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is:\n\n\u0394t = \u03b3\u0394\u03c4\n\nwhere \u0394t is the time in the other frame, \u0394\u03c4 is the proper time (the time measured in the moving frame, which here is the ejecta's frame), and \u03b3 is 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). \n\nWait, but here we need to be careful about which frame is which. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. We need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame. So the Galaxy's frame is the \"stationary\" frame, and the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy. Wait, actually, hold on. The problem says \"From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it.\" So that means in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed, right? Because velocities are relative, but since both are inertial frames, the speed should be the same but in the opposite direction. So the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. \n\nTherefore, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. The question is, when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how far does it travel in the Galaxy's frame? \n\nHmm, so first, we need to find the time that has passed in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Since the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy, the time in the Galaxy's frame will be longer due to time dilation. \n\nWait, but actually, time dilation is symmetric in the sense that each frame sees the other's clocks as running slow. But here, we need to figure out which frame's time is the proper time. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the event occurs at the same place. Since the 50 seconds is the time between two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) that occur at the same place in the ejecta's frame, that is the proper time. Therefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame will be longer. \n\nSo, using the time dilation formula:\n\n\u0394t = \u03b3\u0394\u03c4\n\nWhere \u0394\u03c4 = 50 s, and v = 60,000 km/s. Let me compute gamma first. \n\nFirst, let's convert v to m/s for easier calculation with c, but actually, since we can keep everything in km/s and km, maybe it's okay. Let me see:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s\n\nc = 300,000 km/s\n\nSo v/c = 0.2\n\nTherefore, (v/c)^2 = 0.04\n\nThus, 1 - (v/c)^2 = 0.96\n\nTherefore, sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98\n\nWait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately sqrt(0.9624) is 0.98, but let me compute it more accurately. \n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 4.89898/5 \u2248 0.9798. So approximately 0.98. \n\nTherefore, gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.0206. \n\nTherefore, \u0394t = gamma * \u0394\u03c4 \u2248 1.0206 * 50 \u2248 51.03 seconds. \n\nWait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the time elapsed is about 51.03 seconds. Then, the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame would be v * \u0394t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.03 \u2248 3,061,800 km. \n\nHmm, but the options given are A. 3,060,000 km, B. 2,940,000, C. 3,000,000, D. 2,880,000. \n\nSo my approximate calculation gives around 3,061,800, which is closest to option A. But let me check if I did everything correctly. \n\nWait, but hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider length contraction? Wait, but the question is about the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame. Since in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v, so the distance should be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the Lorentz transformation. Let me try that approach. \n\nIn the ejecta's frame (S'), the two events (start and end of the 50 seconds) occur at the same position, so the distance between them is zero. The time between them is \u0394t' = 50 s. \n\nIn the Galaxy's frame (S), the time between the events is \u0394t = \u03b3(\u0394t' + (v/c\u00b2)\u0394x'). But since \u0394x' = 0 (because in S', the events are at the same place), then \u0394t = \u03b3\u0394t'. Which is the same as before. So that gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, the time in the Galaxy's frame is indeed \u03b3 * 50 s. \n\nSo then, the distance is v * \u0394t = v * \u03b3 * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nWait, so plugging in the numbers again:\n\nv = 60,000 km/s\n\ngamma \u2248 1.0206\n\n\u0394\u03c4 = 50 s\n\nSo distance = 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50\n\nWait, hold on, no. Wait, the time in the Galaxy's frame is \u0394t = gamma * \u0394\u03c4, so the distance is v * \u0394t = v * gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nWait, but that would be 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50. Wait, but that would be 60,000 * 50 * 1.0206. \n\nWait, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. Then multiplied by 1.0206 gives 3,061,800 km, which is option A. \n\nBut let me check if I made an error in gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately. \n\nGiven v = 60,000 km/s, c = 300,000 km/s, so v/c = 0.2. \n\nTherefore, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). \n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96):\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10 \u2248 9.798 / 10 \u2248 0.9798. \n\nTherefore, gamma \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.02062. \n\nTherefore, \u0394t = 50 * 1.02062 \u2248 51.031 seconds. \n\nThen, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.031 \u2248 3,061,860 km. \n\nSo that's approximately 3,061,860 km, which is very close to option A (3,060,000 km). The slight difference is due to rounding. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore relativistic effects? But the problem says both are inertial frames, so probably need to consider relativity. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C is exactly 3,000,000 km, which would be 60,000 * 50. So that's if you just multiplied the speed by the time in the ejecta's frame. But that would be incorrect because the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they consider that in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the center is contracted, so the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is different? Wait, but the question is asking for the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then convert it using length contraction? Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, so in 50 seconds, the center would move 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so the distance the ejecta travels would be different. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame\". \n\nHmm, so in the ejecta's frame, during their 50 seconds, the center moves 3,000,000 km towards them. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s, so the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction? Wait, but the velocity in the ejecta's frame is the same as the velocity in the Galaxy's frame but in the opposite direction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the velocity addition formula? Wait, but since both frames are inertial and moving at constant velocity, the speed is the same. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction? Let me think again. \n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. \n\nTherefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s. \n\nThe time that passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is \u0394t = gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the distance is v * \u0394t = v * gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nSo that's 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2^2)) * 50. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute gamma more precisely. \n\nLet me compute sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 4.89898 / 5 \u2248 0.9798. \n\nTherefore, gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nTherefore, gamma * 50 \u2248 51.031 seconds. \n\nMultiply by 60,000 km/s: 51.031 * 60,000 = ?\n\n51 * 60,000 = 3,060,000\n\n0.031 * 60,000 = 1,860\n\nTotal: 3,061,860 km. \n\nSo that's approximately 3,061,860 km, which is very close to option A (3,060,000 km). The difference is due to rounding gamma to 1.0206. If we use more precise gamma:\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) with more precision. \n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me use the Newton-Raphson method. Let me approximate sqrt(0.96). Let me start with an initial guess of 0.98. \n\nCompute f(x) = x\u00b2 - 0.96. \n\nf(0.98) = 0.9604 - 0.96 = 0.0004\n\nf'(x) = 2x. \n\nNext iteration: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 0.98 - (0.0004)/(2*0.98) = 0.98 - 0.0004 / 1.96 \u2248 0.98 - 0.000204 \u2248 0.979796\n\nCompute x1\u00b2: (0.979796)^2 \u2248 (0.98 - 0.000204)^2 \u2248 0.9604 - 2*0.98*0.000204 + (0.000204)^2 \u2248 0.9604 - 0.0004 + negligible \u2248 0.96 exactly? Wait, but actually, let me compute it properly:\n\n0.979796 * 0.979796:\n\nFirst, 0.9798 * 0.9798:\n\n= (1 - 0.0202)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0202 + (0.0202)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.0404 + 0.000408 \u2248 0.959908. Hmm, but that's not exactly 0.96. Wait, maybe my initial approximation was off. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use calculator-like steps. Let me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me note that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is 0.0004 over 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is 0.98 - delta, where delta is small. Let me set x = 0.98 - delta, so x\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\n(0.98 - delta)^2 = 0.9604 - 1.96 delta + delta\u00b2 = 0.96\n\nTherefore, 0.9604 - 1.96 delta \u2248 0.96 (ignoring delta squared)\n\nThus, -1.96 delta \u2248 -0.0004 \u2192 delta \u2248 0.0004 / 1.96 \u2248 0.000204\n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98 - 0.000204 \u2248 0.979796\n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.979796, so gamma is 1 / 0.979796 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nTherefore, gamma is approximately 1.020620726. \n\nTherefore, \u0394t = 50 * 1.020620726 \u2248 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nThen, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.0310363. \n\nCalculating 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000\n\n60,000 * 1.0310363 \u2248 60,000 * 1 + 60,000 * 0.0310363 \u2248 60,000 + 1,862.18 \u2248 61,862.18\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, 51.0310363 is 50 + 1.0310363. Wait, no, sorry, 51.0310363 is 51.0310363. \n\nWait, 60,000 * 51.0310363 = 60,000 * (50 + 1.0310363) = 60,000*50 + 60,000*1.0310363 = 3,000,000 + 61,862.18 \u2248 3,061,862.18 km. \n\nSo that's approximately 3,061,862 km. \n\nLooking at the options, A is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. The difference is about 1,862 km, which is due to rounding during calculations. Since the problem gives the speed as 60,000 km/s (which is exact?) and time as 50 seconds (exact?), perhaps we need to compute it more precisely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to use the approximation gamma \u2248 1 + 0.5*(v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me see:\n\ngamma \u2248 1 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2). \n\nv = 60,000 km/s, so v\u00b2 = 3.6e9 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2)\n\nc\u00b2 = 9e10 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04, so 0.5 * 0.04 = 0.02. \n\nTherefore, gamma \u2248 1.02. \n\nTherefore, \u0394t \u2248 50 * 1.02 = 51 seconds. \n\nThen, distance is 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000 km, which is exactly option A. \n\nTherefore, maybe the question expects us to use the binomial approximation for gamma, which would give exactly 1.02, leading to 3,060,000 km. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects at all? But the problem states both are inertial frames, so time dilation must be considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering which frame's time is which. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says: \"when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame\". So the proper time is 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by the longer time. \n\nAlternatively, if someone forgets to account for time dilation and just does 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km (option C), but that would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the distance is the same in both frames? But no, because in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it, so the distance covered would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame? But no, it specifically says \"in the Galaxy reference frame\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame and apply length contraction? Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the center travels is 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, that distance would be length-contracted? Wait, no, length contraction is for objects at rest in one frame. \n\nAlternatively, the distance between two points in different frames. Hmm, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the velocity as 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is different? Wait, no, because in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards them, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. \n\nWait, velocity addition: if in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards them, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is v' = -60,000 km/s (assuming the Galaxy is at rest). \n\nTherefore, the speed is the same. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 3,060,000 km. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the speed in the ejecta's frame as the relative speed, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s, so the distance is 60,000 multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is gamma * 50. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if the question is in the other way. Suppose someone confuses the time dilation formula. \n\nSuppose someone thought that the time in the ejecta's frame is longer, so \u0394\u03c4 = \u0394t / gamma. But that would be wrong because the proper time is the shorter one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone thought that the distance is v multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame, so 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 (option C). But that neglects time dilation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use the Doppler shift formula? Let me think. \n\nThe Doppler shift for light would relate the frequencies between the frames, but since we are dealing with time intervals, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the Lorentz transformation for the coordinates. Let me try that. \n\nLet me denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. \n\nIn S', the ejecta is at rest, and the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. \n\nThe two events are: \n\nEvent 1: Start of the 50-second interval at (x', t') = (0, 0). \n\nEvent 2: End of the 50-second interval at (x', t') = (0, 50 s). \n\nWe need to find the coordinates of these events in the Galaxy's frame S. \n\nUsing Lorentz transformations:\n\nx = \u03b3(x' + v t')\n\nt = \u03b3(t' + (v x')/c\u00b2)\n\nSince x' = 0 for both events, \n\nFor Event 1: x = 0, t = \u03b3 * t' = \u03b3 * 0 = 0. \n\nFor Event 2: x = \u03b3(0 + v * 50) = \u03b3 v * 50 \n\nt = \u03b3(50 + 0) = \u03b3 * 50 \n\nTherefore, the distance between the two events in the Galaxy's frame is x2 - x1 = \u03b3 v * 50. \n\nWhich is exactly the same as before: v * gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the distance is indeed 60,000 * gamma * 50. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they consider that in the ejecta's frame, the distance is 3,000,000 km, and in the Galaxy's frame, that distance is length-contracted. Wait, but length contraction is in the direction of motion. \n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the center is decreasing at 60,000 km/s. But the actual distance in the Galaxy's frame would depend on the initial distance, which isn't given. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of the ejecta's time. \n\nWait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, so the ejecta has more time to move. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma precisely with v = 0.2c. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). \n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely. \n\nLet me note that sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5. \n\nsqrt(24) is approximately 4.898979486. \n\nTherefore, sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.898979486 / 5 \u2248 0.979795897. \n\nTherefore, gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nTherefore, gamma * 50 = 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nMultiply by 60,000 km/s: \n\n51.0310363 * 60,000 = \n\nLet me compute 51 * 60,000 = 3,060,000 \n\n0.0310363 * 60,000 = 1,862.178 \n\nTotal: 3,060,000 + 1,862.178 \u2248 3,061,862.18 km. \n\nSo approximately 3,061,862 km. \n\nThe closest option is A (3,060,000 km). The difference is about 1,862 km, which is less than 0.1% of the total. Since the given speed is 60,000 km/s (which is exact?) and time is 50 seconds (exact?), perhaps the question expects us to use gamma \u2248 1.02, leading to exactly 3,060,000 km. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using classical time dilation? Wait, no, time dilation is inherently relativistic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame and then compute the distance in the Galaxy's frame using the same time? But that would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the distance is the same in both frames? But no, because in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it, so the distance covered would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that in the ejecta's frame, the distance is 3,000,000 km, and in the Galaxy's frame, that distance is length-contracted. Wait, but length contraction is for objects at rest in one frame. \n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the center is decreasing at 60,000 km/s. The length between them in the ejecta's frame would be changing, but the length in the Galaxy's frame would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the time that the ejecta's clock measures 50 seconds. \n\nWhich is exactly what we computed: v * gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of gamma? Let me check the Lorentz factor again. \n\nGamma is always greater than 1, so the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is more than 3,000,000 km. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, let me check the options again. \n\nA. 3,060,000 km.\n\nB. 2,940,000 km.\n\nC. 3,000,000 km.\n\nD. 2,880,000 km.\n\nSince the calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 km, which is closest to A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the velocity as 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame, so the distance is v multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame divided by gamma? Wait, no. \n\nWait, if someone incorrectly uses the time in the ejecta's frame without adjusting for time dilation, they get 3,000,000 (option C). \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the time in the ejecta's frame is longer, so they divided by gamma, getting 50 / gamma \u2248 49 seconds, then 60,000 * 49 = 2,940,000 (option B). \n\nBut that would be wrong because the proper time is the shorter one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone confused the velocity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, so the distance is 60,000 multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the distance the supernova ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame, we need to account for time dilation in special relativity. \n\nGiven:\n- The speed of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame, \\( v = 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)\n- The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame, \\( \\Delta \\tau = 50 \\, \\text{s} \\)\n- The speed of light, \\( c = 300,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\)\n\nFirst, calculate the Lorentz factor \\( \\gamma \\):\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{60,000}{300,000} = 0.2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.96}} \\approx 1.0206\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame using time dilation:\n\\[\n\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta \\tau\n\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta t \\approx 1.0206 \\times 50 \\approx 51.03 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\nNow, compute the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = v \\times \\Delta t\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} \\approx 60,000 \\, \\text{km/s} \\times 51.03 \\, \\text{s} \\approx 3,061,860 \\, \\text{km}\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to this calculated value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]"

Wait, the time in the Galaxy's frame is \u0394t = gamma * \u0394\u03c4, so the distance is v * \u0394t = v * gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nWait, but that would be 60,000 * 1.0206 * 50. Wait, but that would be 60,000 * 50 * 1.0206. \n\nWait, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. Then multiplied by 1.0206 gives 3,061,800 km, which is option A. \n\nBut let me check if I made an error in gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately. \n\nGiven v = 60,000 km/s, c = 300,000 km/s, so v/c = 0.2. \n\nTherefore, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). \n\nCalculating sqrt(0.96):\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(96/100) = sqrt(96)/10 \u2248 9.798 / 10 \u2248 0.9798. \n\nTherefore, gamma \u2248 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nSo gamma is approximately 1.02062. \n\nTherefore, \u0394t = 50 * 1.02062 \u2248 51.031 seconds. \n\nThen, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.031 \u2248 3,061,860 km. \n\nSo that's approximately 3,061,860 km, which is very close to option A (3,060,000 km). The slight difference is due to rounding. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to ignore relativistic effects? But the problem says both are inertial frames, so probably need to consider relativity. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C is exactly 3,000,000 km, which would be 60,000 * 50. So that's if you just multiplied the speed by the time in the ejecta's frame. But that would be incorrect because the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they consider that in the ejecta's frame, the distance to the center is contracted, so the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is different? Wait, but the question is asking for the distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to compute the distance in the ejecta's frame and then convert it using length contraction? Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, so in 50 seconds, the center would move 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center, so the distance the ejecta travels would be different. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame\". \n\nHmm, so in the ejecta's frame, during their 50 seconds, the center moves 3,000,000 km towards them. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s, so the distance it travels is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame and then apply length contraction? Wait, but the velocity in the ejecta's frame is the same as the velocity in the Galaxy's frame but in the opposite direction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use the velocity addition formula? Wait, but since both frames are inertial and moving at constant velocity, the speed is the same. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction? Let me think again. \n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. \n\nTherefore, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s. \n\nThe time that passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is \u0394t = gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the distance is v * \u0394t = v * gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nSo that's 60,000 * (1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2^2)) * 50. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute gamma more precisely. \n\nLet me compute sqrt(1 - 0.04) = sqrt(0.96). Let me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nsqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 \u2248 4.89898 / 5 \u2248 0.9798. \n\nTherefore, gamma is 1 / 0.9798 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nTherefore, gamma * 50 \u2248 51.031 seconds. \n\nMultiply by 60,000 km/s: 51.031 * 60,000 = ?\n\n51 * 60,000 = 3,060,000\n\n0.031 * 60,000 = 1,860\n\nTotal: 3,061,860 km. \n\nSo that's approximately 3,061,860 km, which is very close to option A (3,060,000 km). The difference is due to rounding gamma to 1.0206. If we use more precise gamma:\n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) with more precision. \n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me use the Newton-Raphson method. Let me approximate sqrt(0.96). Let me start with an initial guess of 0.98. \n\nCompute f(x) = x\u00b2 - 0.96. \n\nf(0.98) = 0.9604 - 0.96 = 0.0004\n\nf'(x) = 2x. \n\nNext iteration: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0) = 0.98 - (0.0004)/(2*0.98) = 0.98 - 0.0004 / 1.96 \u2248 0.98 - 0.000204 \u2248 0.979796\n\nCompute x1\u00b2: (0.979796)^2 \u2248 (0.98 - 0.000204)^2 \u2248 0.9604 - 2*0.98*0.000204 + (0.000204)^2 \u2248 0.9604 - 0.0004 + negligible \u2248 0.96 exactly? Wait, but actually, let me compute it properly:\n\n0.979796 * 0.979796:\n\nFirst, 0.9798 * 0.9798:\n\n= (1 - 0.0202)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0202 + (0.0202)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.0404 + 0.000408 \u2248 0.959908. Hmm, but that's not exactly 0.96. Wait, maybe my initial approximation was off. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use calculator-like steps. Let me compute sqrt(0.96):\n\nLet me note that 0.98^2 = 0.9604, which is 0.0004 over 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is 0.98 - delta, where delta is small. Let me set x = 0.98 - delta, so x\u00b2 = 0.96.\n\n(0.98 - delta)^2 = 0.9604 - 1.96 delta + delta\u00b2 = 0.96\n\nTherefore, 0.9604 - 1.96 delta \u2248 0.96 (ignoring delta squared)\n\nThus, -1.96 delta \u2248 -0.0004 \u2192 delta \u2248 0.0004 / 1.96 \u2248 0.000204\n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.98 - 0.000204 \u2248 0.979796\n\nTherefore, sqrt(0.96) \u2248 0.979796, so gamma is 1 / 0.979796 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nTherefore, gamma is approximately 1.020620726. \n\nTherefore, \u0394t = 50 * 1.020620726 \u2248 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nThen, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.0310363 s \u2248 60,000 * 51.0310363. \n\nCalculating 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000\n\n60,000 * 1.0310363 \u2248 60,000 * 1 + 60,000 * 0.0310363 \u2248 60,000 + 1,862.18 \u2248 61,862.18\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, 51.0310363 is 50 + 1.0310363. Wait, no, sorry, 51.0310363 is 51.0310363. \n\nWait, 60,000 * 51.0310363 = 60,000 * (50 + 1.0310363) = 60,000*50 + 60,000*1.0310363 = 3,000,000 + 61,862.18 \u2248 3,061,862.18 km. \n\nSo that's approximately 3,061,862 km. \n\nLooking at the options, A is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. The difference is about 1,862 km, which is due to rounding during calculations. Since the problem gives the speed as 60,000 km/s (which is exact?) and time as 50 seconds (exact?), perhaps we need to compute it more precisely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to use the approximation gamma \u2248 1 + 0.5*(v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Let me see:\n\ngamma \u2248 1 + (v\u00b2)/(2c\u00b2). \n\nv = 60,000 km/s, so v\u00b2 = 3.6e9 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2)\n\nc\u00b2 = 9e10 (km\u00b2/s\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 3.6e9 / 9e10 = 0.04, so 0.5 * 0.04 = 0.02. \n\nTherefore, gamma \u2248 1.02. \n\nTherefore, \u0394t \u2248 50 * 1.02 = 51 seconds. \n\nThen, distance is 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000 km, which is exactly option A. \n\nTherefore, maybe the question expects us to use the binomial approximation for gamma, which would give exactly 1.02, leading to 3,060,000 km. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects at all? But the problem states both are inertial frames, so time dilation must be considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering which frame's time is which. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says: \"when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame\". So the proper time is 50 seconds. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is v multiplied by the longer time. \n\nAlternatively, if someone forgets to account for time dilation and just does 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km (option C), but that would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the distance is the same in both frames? But no, because in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it, so the distance covered would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame? But no, it specifically says \"in the Galaxy reference frame\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame and apply length contraction? Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance the center travels is 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 km. But in the Galaxy's frame, that distance would be length-contracted? Wait, no, length contraction is for objects at rest in one frame. \n\nAlternatively, the distance between two points in different frames. Hmm, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the velocity as 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, but in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is different? Wait, no, because in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards them, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. \n\nWait, velocity addition: if in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards them, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is v' = -60,000 km/s (assuming the Galaxy is at rest). \n\nTherefore, the speed is the same. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 3,060,000 km. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the speed in the ejecta's frame as the relative speed, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is 60,000 km/s, so the distance is 60,000 multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is gamma * 50. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if the question is in the other way. Suppose someone confuses the time dilation formula. \n\nSuppose someone thought that the time in the ejecta's frame is longer, so \u0394\u03c4 = \u0394t / gamma. But that would be wrong because the proper time is the shorter one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone thought that the distance is v multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame, so 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000 (option C). But that neglects time dilation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use the Doppler shift formula? Let me think. \n\nThe Doppler shift for light would relate the frequencies between the frames, but since we are dealing with time intervals, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the Lorentz transformation for the coordinates. Let me try that. \n\nLet me denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. \n\nIn S', the ejecta is at rest, and the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. \n\nThe two events are: \n\nEvent 1: Start of the 50-second interval at (x', t') = (0, 0). \n\nEvent 2: End of the 50-second interval at (x', t') = (0, 50 s). \n\nWe need to find the coordinates of these events in the Galaxy's frame S. \n\nUsing Lorentz transformations:\n\nx = \u03b3(x' + v t')\n\nt = \u03b3(t' + (v x')/c\u00b2)\n\nSince x' = 0 for both events, \n\nFor Event 1: x = 0, t = \u03b3 * t' = \u03b3 * 0 = 0. \n\nFor Event 2: x = \u03b3(0 + v * 50) = \u03b3 v * 50 \n\nt = \u03b3(50 + 0) = \u03b3 * 50 \n\nTherefore, the distance between the two events in the Galaxy's frame is x2 - x1 = \u03b3 v * 50. \n\nWhich is exactly the same as before: v * gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the distance is indeed 60,000 * gamma * 50. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they consider that in the ejecta's frame, the distance is 3,000,000 km, and in the Galaxy's frame, that distance is length-contracted. Wait, but length contraction is in the direction of motion. \n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the center is decreasing at 60,000 km/s. But the actual distance in the Galaxy's frame would depend on the initial distance, which isn't given. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of the ejecta's time. \n\nWait, but in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, so the ejecta has more time to move. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma precisely with v = 0.2c. \n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.2\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96). \n\nLet me compute sqrt(0.96) precisely. \n\nLet me note that sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5. \n\nsqrt(24) is approximately 4.898979486. \n\nTherefore, sqrt(24)/5 \u2248 4.898979486 / 5 \u2248 0.979795897. \n\nTherefore, gamma = 1 / 0.979795897 \u2248 1.020620726. \n\nTherefore, gamma * 50 = 51.0310363 seconds. \n\nMultiply by 60,000 km/s: \n\n51.0310363 * 60,000 = \n\nLet me compute 51 * 60,000 = 3,060,000 \n\n0.0310363 * 60,000 = 1,862.178 \n\nTotal: 3,060,000 + 1,862.178 \u2248 3,061,862.18 km. \n\nSo approximately 3,061,862 km. \n\nThe closest option is A (3,060,000 km). The difference is about 1,862 km, which is less than 0.1% of the total. Since the given speed is 60,000 km/s (which is exact?) and time is 50 seconds (exact?), perhaps the question expects us to use gamma \u2248 1.02, leading to exactly 3,060,000 km. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using classical time dilation? Wait, no, time dilation is inherently relativistic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the velocity in the ejecta's frame and then compute the distance in the Galaxy's frame using the same time? But that would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the distance is the same in both frames? But no, because in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it, so the distance covered would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that in the ejecta's frame, the distance is 3,000,000 km, and in the Galaxy's frame, that distance is length-contracted. Wait, but length contraction is for objects at rest in one frame. \n\nWait, in the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the center is decreasing at 60,000 km/s. The length between them in the ejecta's frame would be changing, but the length in the Galaxy's frame would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the time that the ejecta's clock measures 50 seconds. \n\nWhich is exactly what we computed: v * gamma * \u0394\u03c4. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of gamma? Let me check the Lorentz factor again. \n\nGamma is always greater than 1, so the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance is more than 3,000,000 km. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, let me check the options again. \n\nA. 3,060,000 km.\n\nB. 2,940,000 km.\n\nC. 3,000,000 km.\n\nD. 2,880,000 km.\n\nSince the calculation gives approximately 3,061,862 km, which is closest to A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the velocity as 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame, so the distance is v multiplied by the time in the ejecta's frame divided by gamma? Wait, no. \n\nWait, if someone incorrectly uses the time in the ejecta's frame without adjusting for time dilation, they get 3,000,000 (option C). \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the time in the ejecta's frame is longer, so they divided by gamma, getting 50 / gamma \u2248 49 seconds, then 60,000 * 49 = 2,940,000 (option B). \n\nBut that would be wrong because the proper time is the shorter one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone confused the velocity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, so the distance is 60,000 multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. \n\n",
