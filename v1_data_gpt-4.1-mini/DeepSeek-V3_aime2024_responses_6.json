        "question": "Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

        "response": "Alright, I have this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Let me try to understand it step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nEach vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime positive integers. What is \\(m+n\\)?\n\nOkay, so we have a regular octagon, which means it has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a probability of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). We need to find the probability that, by rotating the octagon, all the blue vertices end up in positions that were originally red.\n\nFirst, let's break this down:\n\n1. **Total number of colorings:** Since each vertex can be red or blue, and there are 8 vertices, the total number of possible colorings is \\(2^8 = 256\\).\n\n2. **Desired colorings:** We need to find the number of colorings where, after some rotation, all blue vertices are in positions that were originally red.\n\nWait, that's a bit abstract. Maybe I can think of it differently. Let's denote the original coloring as \\(C\\) and the rotated coloring as \\(C'\\). We want \\(C'\\) to have blue vertices only where \\(C\\) had red vertices.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of permutations. Rotating the octagon corresponds to a cyclic permutation of the vertices. There are 8 possible rotations (including the identity rotation, which is rotating by 0 positions).\n\nSo, for a given coloring, we need to check if there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices in the rotated coloring correspond to red vertices in the original coloring.\n\nHmm, that's still a bit vague. Maybe I can think of it in terms of sets. Let\u2019s denote the set of blue vertices in the original coloring as \\(B\\) and the set of red vertices as \\(R\\). After rotation, the set of blue vertices becomes \\(B'\\), and we want \\(B' \\subseteq R\\).\n\nWait, but actually, we want all blue vertices in the rotated coloring to be in positions that were red in the original coloring. So, if we rotate the coloring, the new blue vertices should be a subset of the original red vertices.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of functions. Let\u2019s label the vertices as \\(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_8\\). A rotation can be represented as a cyclic shift. For example, rotating by \\(k\\) positions maps \\(v_i\\) to \\(v_{i+k \\mod 8}\\).\n\nGiven a coloring, we can represent it as a function \\(f: \\{v_1, \\dots, v_8\\} \\to \\{\\text{red}, \\text{blue}\\}\\). We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation \\(r\\) such that for every vertex \\(v\\), if \\(r(v)\\) is blue, then \\(v\\) was red.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of binary strings. Let's represent red as 0 and blue as 1. Then, each coloring corresponds to an 8-bit binary string. We need to find the number of binary strings such that, when cyclically shifted by some amount, all the 1's in the shifted string correspond to 0's in the original string.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original string as \\(s = s_1 s_2 \\dots s_8\\), where each \\(s_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\). A cyclic shift by \\(k\\) positions gives the string \\(s' = s_{k+1} s_{k+2} \\dots s_8 s_1 \\dots s_k\\). We need \\(s'_i = 1\\) only if \\(s_i = 0\\).\n\nWait, that's not quite right. If \\(s'_i = 1\\), then \\(s_{i+k \\mod 8} = 1\\). We want \\(s_{i+k \\mod 8} = 1\\) only if \\(s_i = 0\\). So, for each \\(i\\), \\(s_{i+k \\mod 8} = 1\\) implies \\(s_i = 0\\).\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can think of it in terms of permutations and inverses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the problem as finding the number of colorings where the set of blue vertices is disjoint from the set of red vertices under some rotation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of group actions. The group of rotations acts on the set of colorings. We need to count the number of colorings that are fixed by some rotation in the sense that the rotation maps blue vertices to positions that were red.\n\nThis seems like it might involve Burnside's lemma, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it in terms of binary strings and cyclic shifts.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original string as \\(s\\) and the rotated string as \\(s'\\). We want \\(s'\\) to have 1's only where \\(s\\) has 0's. So, \\(s'\\) is a subset of the complement of \\(s\\).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the positions. Let\u2019s denote the set of positions where \\(s\\) has 1's as \\(B\\), and the set of positions where \\(s\\) has 0's as \\(R\\). Then, after rotation, the set of positions with 1's is \\(B'\\), and we want \\(B' \\subseteq R\\).\n\nBut \\(B'\\) is just \\(B\\) shifted by some \\(k\\). So, we need \\(B + k \\subseteq R\\), where addition is modulo 8.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the complement. Since \\(R\\) is the complement of \\(B\\), we have \\(B + k \\subseteq R\\) if and only if \\(B + k\\) is disjoint from \\(B\\).\n\nSo, we need to find the number of subsets \\(B\\) of \\(\\{1, 2, \\dots, 8\\}\\) such that there exists a \\(k\\) (from 0 to 7) where \\(B + k\\) is disjoint from \\(B\\).\n\nThis seems like a combinatorial problem. Maybe I can count the number of such subsets.\n\nFirst, note that \\(k = 0\\) is not useful because \\(B + 0 = B\\), which is not disjoint from \\(B\\) unless \\(B\\) is empty. So, \\(k\\) can be from 1 to 7.\n\nFor each \\(k\\), we need to count the number of subsets \\(B\\) such that \\(B + k\\) is disjoint from \\(B\\).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of binary strings and cyclic shifts.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original string as \\(s\\) and the rotated string as \\(s'\\).
