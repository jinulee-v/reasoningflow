        "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\nA. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD. G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1",
        "response": "To determine which conclusion best fits the experimental data, we need to analyze the resistance levels of the single and double mutants.\n\nFirstly, let's summarize the resistance levels:\n- **g1**: 75%\n- **g2**: 0%\n- **g3**: 50%\n- **g1g3**: 10%\n- **g2g3**: 0%\n- **g1g2**: 0%\n\nFrom the data, we can infer the following:\n\n1. **g2** shows complete loss of resistance (0%), indicating that G2 is essential for resistance.\n2. **g1** shows reduced but not complete loss of resistance (75%), suggesting that G1 contributes to resistance but is not as critical as G2.\n3. **g3** also shows reduced resistance (50%), indicating that G3 is important but less so than G2.\n4. The double mutants **g1g2**, **g2g3**, and **g1g3** all show very low or no resistance (0% or 10%), suggesting that the combined absence of any two genes severely compromises resistance.\n\nGiven that **g2** alone results in complete loss of resistance, it suggests that G2 might be a key regulator (likely a transcription factor) that controls the expression of other genes involved in resistance. This aligns with the statement that \"at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s).\"\n\nNext, consider the interactions between the genes:\n- **g1g3** shows very low resistance (10%), indicating that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, but their combined absence severely reduces it.\n- **g1g2** and **g2g3** both show complete loss of resistance (0%), suggesting that G2 is crucial and its absence overrides the presence of either G1 or G3.\n\nBased on these observations, the most fitting conclusion is:\n- **G2 is a transcription factor** (since its knockout completely abolishes resistance).\n- **G1 and G3 show some redundancy** (since their combined absence in **g1g3** results in very low resistance, but individually they still provide some resistance).\n- **G1 is epistatic towards G3** (since the presence of G1 does not fully compensate for the loss of G3, and vice versa).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.**"
