        "response": "Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. So, the question is about transcription factors and mutations affecting their function. Let me start by understanding the scenario given.\n\nFirst, the normal process: A transcription factor subunit is inactive until it gets a signal via phosphorylation on serine residues in the transactivation domain. Once phosphorylated, it dimerizes, moves into the nucleus, and helps in gene transcription. So phosphorylation triggers dimerization, nuclear translocation, and activation.\n\nNow, there are two mutations mentioned. Mutation X is a missense mutation in the transactivation domain, and it's a recessive loss-of-function mutation. That means when an individual has two copies of X (homozygous), the transcription factor doesn't work. But if they're heterozygous (one X and one normal), the normal allele can compensate, so the function isn't lost. Makes sense because recessive alleles typically require both copies to be mutated to show the phenotype.\n\nMutation Y is in the dimerization domain and is heterozygous, acting as a dominant-negative. Dominant-negative mutations are interesting because a single copy of the mutant allele disrupts the function of the wild-type allele. So even if you have one normal and one Y allele, the overall function is impaired. Dominant-negative effects usually happen when the mutant protein interferes with the normal protein's function, often by forming non-functional complexes.\n\nThe question asks which molecular phenotype is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y. The options are A to D.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype. Gain-of-function would mean the protein does something new or enhanced. But mutation Y is a dominant-negative, which typically causes a loss of function, not gain. So probably not A.\n\nB. Loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype. Wait, if dimerization is lost, then the transcription factor can't form dimers, which is necessary for its function. But the phenotype here is wild-type? That doesn't make sense. If dimerization is lost, function should be lost. So B seems contradictory. Maybe not B.\n\nC. Protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype. Aggregation could happen if the mutant protein forms clumps, but does that relate to dimerization domain mutation? If the dimerization domain is faulty, maybe the proteins can't properly dimerize. But if Y is dominant-negative, perhaps the mutant subunit binds to the wild-type subunit but prevents proper dimerization. If they form abnormal dimers that can't function, that would lead to loss of function. Aggregation might be a possibility, but I'm not sure if that's the primary issue here. Maybe C is possible, but let's check D.\n\nD. Protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele. If the mutant Y causes the wild-type protein to be degraded, that would mean the wild-type allele isn't functional. But mutation Y is in the dimerization domain. If the mutant protein forms a dimer with the wild-type, maybe the complex is unstable and gets tagged for degradation? Or perhaps the mutant protein doesn't dimerize properly and both are degraded? Alternatively, if the dimerization is necessary for stability, then maybe the mutant causes the wild-type to be degraded. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, dominant-negative often works by the mutant binding to the wild-type and inactivating it, not necessarily causing degradation. So maybe D is not the case. \n\nWait, the question says mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative. So normally, after phosphorylation, the subunits dimerize. If one subunit has a mutation in the dimerization domain, when it tries to dimerize with the wild-type subunit, the dimer might not form properly. So the mutant Y protein might still bind to the wild-type but prevent proper dimerization, rendering the complex non-functional. So the presence of Y would result in some dimers that are non-functional. Since the mutation is dominant-negative, even half the dimers being bad (assuming heterozygosity) would lead to a significant loss of function. \n\nIn that case, the dimerization is lost or ineffective. So the phenotype would be loss of function. But looking at the options:\n\nOption C says protein aggregation and loss of function. If the mutant and wild-type proteins form aggregates because they can't properly dimerize, that could lead to loss of function. But I'm not sure if aggregation is the direct result here. Alternatively, if dimerization is prevented, the proteins might not aggregate but just not form dimers. However, sometimes when proteins can't form their proper complexes, they might misfold and aggregate. But maybe in this case, the issue is failure to dimerize rather than aggregation.\n\nOption D suggests protein degradation. If the mutant Y causes the wild-type protein to be degraded, that would lead to loss of function. But how? If the dimerization is faulty, perhaps the mutant and wild-type form a complex that is recognized as abnormal and targeted for degradation. For example, if the dimerization domain is necessary for proper structure, and the mutant disrupts that, the cell might degrade both proteins. That would mean the wild-type allele's protein is also degraded because it's in a complex with the mutant. So the presence of Y would lead to less wild-type protein because it's being degraded along with the mutant. That would be a dominant-negative effect where the mutant causes the wild-type protein to be non-functional, possibly through degradation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutant Y protein can't dimerize, so the wild-type protein can't form functional dimers either because half the subunits are mutant. So even if the wild-type protein is present, when it tries to dimerize, there's a 50% chance it pairs with a mutant Y subunit that can't function. So the effective functional dimers would be 25% (since each dimer has two subunits, in a heterozygous case, the probability of both being wild-type is 0.5*0.5=0.25). So only 25% of dimers would be functional. That would lead to a loss of function, but not due to degradation or aggregation\u2014just ineffective dimers.\n\nBut the options given don't mention ineffective dimers directly. Let's look again:\n\nC. protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype.\n\nD. protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n\nIf mutation Y causes the protein to aggregate, then both the mutant and wild-type might form aggregates, leading to loss of function. But does a dimerization domain mutation lead to aggregation? Maybe not necessarily. If the dimerization domain is necessary for proper folding, then a mutation might cause misfolding and aggregation. But if the domain is just for binding to another subunit, then the protein might not aggregate but just be unable to form dimers.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y protein can still bind to the wild-type but in a way that prevents proper dimerization, maybe the proteins form non-functional complexes that are unstable and get degraded. So the wild-type protein is being tied up in non-functional dimers that are then degraded. That would fit option D: protein degradation and loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\nBut I need to recall: dominant-negative mutations often work by the mutant subunit incorporating into a multimeric protein and rendering the entire complex non-functional. For example, in a dimer, if one subunit is non-functional, the entire dimer doesn't work. But in that case, the problem is not degradation but non-functional complexes. However, sometimes the cell has quality control mechanisms that detect abnormal proteins and degrade them. So if the mutant subunit causes the entire complex to be recognized as abnormal, leading to degradation, then D could be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y prevents dimerization entirely, then the wild-type protein might remain monomeric. If the transcription factor needs to dimerize to function, then monomers are non-functional. In that case, even though the wild-type protein is present, it can't form dimers because the mutant Y either can't dimerize or interferes with dimerization. So the loss of dimerization would lead to loss of function. But the answer options don't have \"loss of dimerization\" except in option B, which says \"loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype,\" which is contradictory because loss of dimerization should lead to loss of function.\n\nWait, option B says loss of dimerization but wild-type phenotype? That doesn't make sense. So B is incorrect.\n\nSo between C and D. If the mutant Y causes the wild-type protein to be degraded, then D is correct. If it causes aggregation, then C is correct. Which is more likely?\n\nDominant-negative mutations can work through several mechanisms. One common mechanism is that the mutant protein forms a non-functional complex with the wild-type protein, thereby inactivating it. For example, in a receptor tyrosine kinase, a dominant-negative mutant might lack the kinase domain but still dimerize with the wild-type receptor, preventing its activation.\n\nIn this case, the transcription factor needs to dimerize. If mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, the mutant subunit might still be able to dimerize with the wild-type subunit but the resulting dimer is non-functional. Alternatively, the mutant might prevent dimerization altogether.\n\nIf the dimerization domain is necessary for the two subunits to come together, a mutation here might prevent dimerization. However, if the mutation is a missense (changing one amino acid), perhaps the mutant can still interact but not properly. For example, the dimerization might be unstable or the structure incorrect.\n\nIf the mutant Y can dimerize with the wild-type but the dimer is non-functional, then the presence of Y would sequester the wild-type subunits into non-functional dimers. This would effectively reduce the number of functional dimers (since each wild-type subunit paired with a mutant is non-functional). In this case, the problem is not degradation or aggregation, but ineffective dimers. However, none of the options directly state this.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y cannot dimerize at all, then in a heterozygous individual, half the subunits are mutant and cannot dimerize, while the other half are wild-type. The wild-type subunits could dimerize with each other, but in a heterozygous case, the probability of two wild-type subunits coming together is 25% (since each subunit has a 50% chance of being wild-type or mutant). So 25% functional dimers, 50% mixed dimers (non-functional), and 25% mutant dimers (non-functional). But if the mutant Y cannot dimerize at all, then the mixed dimers might not form. Wait, if the mutant Y cannot dimerize, then the wild-type subunits can only form dimers with other wild-type subunits. But in a heterozygous individual, the total number of wild-type subunits is half. So the amount of functional dimers would be proportional to the square of the concentration of wild-type subunits. But I'm not sure if that's how it works in reality.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y can't dimerize, then the wild-type subunits can still dimerize among themselves. But if the mutant Y somehow interferes with this process, perhaps by competing for binding or causing instability, then the wild-type dimers might not form properly. But if Y can't dimerize, maybe they just float around as monomers and don't interfere. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's go back to the options. The question states that mutation Y is a dominant-negative. Dominant-negative means that the presence of the mutant allele interferes with the function of the wild-type allele. The mechanism is typically that the mutant protein disrupts the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming a non-functional complex.\n\nIn this case, since the mutation is in the dimerization domain, the mutant protein might still bind to the wild-type protein but prevent proper dimerization. For example, if the dimerization requires both subunits to have intact domains, a mutation in one might prevent the dimer from forming correctly. Alternatively, the mutant might allow dimerization but the resulting dimer is non-functional.\n\nIf the dimer is non-functional, then the presence of Y would lead to a situation where half of the potential dimers are non-functional (assuming heterozygosity). But actually, in a heterozygous individual, each subunit has a 50% chance of being mutant. The probability of forming a wild-type dimer is 25%, a heterodimer (one wild-type, one mutant) is 50%, and a mutant dimer is 25%. If the heterodimer is non-functional, then only 25% of dimers are functional. That's a 75% reduction in function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. However, the question is about the molecular phenotype, not the overall organismal phenotype.\n\nThe options are about what happens molecularly. So if the heterodimers are non-functional because of the mutation Y, then the molecular phenotype is loss of dimerization function. But none of the options directly state that. Option C says protein aggregation and loss of function. Option D says protein degradation and loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\nAnother possibility is that the mutant Y protein, when bound to the wild-type, causes the entire complex to be unstable and targeted for degradation. For example, if the dimerization domain is important for the stability of the protein, a mutation there could lead to the complex being recognized by the cell's quality control systems (like the ubiquitin-proteasome system) and degraded. In that case, the wild-type protein would be degraded along with the mutant, leading to a loss of function. This would be option D.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y protein doesn't cause degradation but just forms non-functional dimers, then the wild-type protein is still present but tied up in non-functional complexes. In that case, the molecular phenotype would be the presence of non-functional dimers, but the proteins aren't aggregated or degraded. However, none of the options mention this scenario.\n\nGiven the options provided, I need to choose between C and D. The question states that mutation Y is dominant-negative. Dominant-negative often involves the mutant interfering with the wild-type's function. If the mutant causes the wild-type protein to be non-functional by forming a complex that is then degraded, that would be D. If the mutant causes aggregation, that's C.\n\nWhich is more likely? I think in many cases, dominant-negative mutations result in the formation of non-functional complexes rather than aggregation or degradation. However, sometimes the improper complexes can lead to degradation. For example, if a protein must form a dimer to be stable, then monomers might be degraded. If mutation Y prevents dimerization, then both mutant and wild-type proteins might be monomers and thus degraded. But in this case, the mutation is in the dimerization domain, so perhaps the mutant can't form dimers, leading to monomers. If the wild-type protein can still dimerize with itself, then maybe only the mutant is degraded. But if the presence of the mutant somehow causes the wild-type to remain monomeric and thus be degraded, then D would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the wild-type can still dimerize with itself, then even in the presence of mutant Y, some wild-type dimers would form. But if the mutant Y competes for binding, perhaps reducing the number of wild-type dimers. However, this is getting too detailed.\n\nAnother angle: the question says mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative. So the key issue is dimerization. If the dimerization is prevented, then the transcription factor can't function. But how does a heterozygous mutation Y act as dominant-negative? Because even if one allele is normal, the product of the normal allele can't form functional dimers because the mutant Y subunits interfere.\n\nWait, maybe the mutant Y subunits can still dimerize but the dimer is non-functional. For example, if the dimerization domain is necessary for proper conformation, a mutant Y might allow dimerization but the resulting dimer can't translocate to the nucleus or activate transcription. In that case, the presence of Y would lead to dimers that are non-functional. But the wild-type subunits would form some functional dimers. However, in a heterozygous individual, half the subunits are Y and half are wild-type. The chance of a wild-type dimer is 25%, so only 25% activity. That's a dominant-negative effect. But the molecular phenotype here is the presence of non-functional dimers, not aggregation or degradation. But none of the options state that.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y subunits bind to wild-type subunits and prevent their dimerization, causing them to remain as monomers. If monomers are unstable and get degraded, then the wild-type protein would be degraded when bound to Y. That would fit option D: protein degradation and loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\nAlternatively, if monomers are stable but just can't function, then the phenotype is loss of function due to lack of dimerization, but the proteins aren't degraded. But again, the options don't have that.\n\nGiven the options, I think D is a possibility if the mutant Y causes the wild-type protein to be degraded. But I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think: recessive loss-of-function mutations (like X) require both copies to be inactive. Dominant-negative mutations (like Y) mean that even one copy disrupts the function. So in Y's case, the presence of the mutant protein interferes with the normal protein's function.\n\nIf Y is in the dimerization domain, the mutant protein might form a dimer with the wild-type protein, but this dimer can't function. If these non-functional dimers are then targeted for degradation, then the wild-type protein is degraded along with the mutant, leading to loss of function. That would be D.\n\nAlternatively, if the dimer is formed but non-functional and not degraded, then the phenotype is due to non-functional dimers. But the question asks for the molecular phenotype observed. The options are about what's happening at the protein level.\n\nIf the proteins are forming dimers that can't function, the molecular phenotype is loss of dimerization function. But none of the options say that. Option C says aggregation, which is clumping of proteins, but that's different from non-functional dimers. Option D says degradation, which is the proteins being broken down.\n\nIn some cases, when proteins are part of a complex that's improperly formed, the cell's quality control systems mark them for degradation. For example, if a protein must form a dimer to be stable, failure to dimerize could lead to ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. So if the mutant Y prevents dimerization, both the mutant and wild-type proteins might be degraded because they can't form dimers. But wait, the wild-type protein could potentially dimerize with itself. However, if the mutant Y is present and can't dimerize, maybe the wild-type is outnumbered or the presence of Y monomers somehow interferes.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y can form a dimer with the wild-type but it's a structurally abnormal dimer that's recognized as misfolded and targeted for degradation. In that case, the wild-type protein is being pulled into these abnormal dimers and degraded, hence D is correct.\n\nI think this is the most likely scenario for a dominant-negative effect in this context. So the answer would be D: protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele."

            "text": "So if the mutant subunit causes the entire complex to be recognized as abnormal, leading to degradation, then D could be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y prevents dimerization entirely, then the wild-type protein might remain monomeric. If the transcription factor needs to dimerize to function, then monomers are non-functional. In that case, even though the wild-type protein is present, it can't form dimers because the mutant Y either can't dimerize or interferes with dimerization. So the loss of dimerization would lead to loss of function. But the answer options don't have \"loss of dimerization\" except in option B, which says \"loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype,\" which is contradictory because loss of dimerization should lead to loss of function.\n\nWait, option B says loss of dimerization but wild-type phenotype? That doesn't make sense. So B is incorrect.\n\nSo between C and D. If the mutant Y causes the wild-type protein to be degraded, then D is correct. If it causes aggregation, then C is correct. Which is more likely?\n\nDominant-negative mutations can work through several mechanisms. One common mechanism is that the mutant protein forms a non-functional complex with the wild-type protein, thereby inactivating it. For example, in a receptor tyrosine kinase, a dominant-negative mutant might lack the kinase domain but still dimerize with the wild-type receptor, preventing its activation.\n\nIn this case, the transcription factor needs to dimerize. If mutation Y is in the dimerization domain, the mutant subunit might still be able to dimerize with the wild-type subunit but the resulting dimer is non-functional. Alternatively, the mutant might prevent dimerization altogether.\n\nIf the dimerization domain is necessary for the two subunits to come together, a mutation here might prevent dimerization. However, if the mutation is a missense (changing one amino acid), perhaps the mutant can still interact but not properly. For example, the dimerization might be unstable or the structure incorrect.\n\nIf the mutant Y can dimerize with the wild-type but the dimer is non-functional, then the presence of Y would sequester the wild-type subunits into non-functional dimers. This would effectively reduce the number of functional dimers (since each wild-type subunit paired with a mutant is non-functional). In this case, the problem is not degradation or aggregation, but ineffective dimers. However, none of the options directly state this.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y cannot dimerize at all, then in a heterozygous individual, half the subunits are mutant and cannot dimerize, while the other half are wild-type. The wild-type subunits could dimerize with each other, but in a heterozygous case, the probability of two wild-type subunits coming together is 25% (since each subunit has a 50% chance of being wild-type or mutant). So 25% functional dimers, 50% mixed dimers (non-functional), and 25% mutant dimers (non-functional). But if the mutant Y cannot dimerize at all, then the mixed dimers might not form. Wait, if the mutant Y cannot dimerize, then the wild-type subunits can only form dimers with other wild-type subunits. But in a heterozygous individual, the total number of wild-type subunits is half. So the amount of functional dimers would be proportional to the square of the concentration of wild-type subunits. But I'm not sure if that's how it works in reality.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y can't dimerize, then the wild-type subunits can still dimerize among themselves. But if the mutant Y somehow interferes with this process, perhaps by competing for binding or causing instability, then the wild-type dimers might not form properly. But if Y can't dimerize, maybe they just float around as monomers and don't interfere. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's go back to the options. The question states that mutation Y is a dominant-negative. Dominant-negative means that the presence of the mutant allele interferes with the function of the wild-type allele. The mechanism is typically that the mutant protein disrupts the function of the wild-type protein, often by forming a non-functional complex.\n\nIn this case, since the mutation is in the dimerization domain, the mutant protein might still bind to the wild-type protein but prevent proper dimerization. For example, if the dimerization requires both subunits to have intact domains, a mutation in one might prevent the dimer from forming correctly. Alternatively, the mutant might allow dimerization but the resulting dimer is non-functional.\n\nIf the dimer is non-functional, then the presence of Y would lead to a situation where half of the potential dimers are non-functional (assuming heterozygosity). But actually, in a heterozygous individual, each subunit has a 50% chance of being mutant. The probability of forming a wild-type dimer is 25%, a heterodimer (one wild-type, one mutant) is 50%, and a mutant dimer is 25%. If the heterodimer is non-functional, then only 25% of dimers are functional. That's a 75% reduction in function, leading to a loss-of-function phenotype. However, the question is about the molecular phenotype, not the overall organismal phenotype.\n\nThe options are about what happens molecularly. So if the heterodimers are non-functional because of the mutation Y, then the molecular phenotype is loss of dimerization function. But none of the options directly state that. Option C says protein aggregation and loss of function. Option D says protein degradation and loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\nAnother possibility is that the mutant Y protein, when bound to the wild-type, causes the entire complex to be unstable and targeted for degradation. For example, if the dimerization domain is important for the stability of the protein, a mutation there could lead to the complex being recognized by the cell's quality control systems (like the ubiquitin-proteasome system) and degraded. In that case, the wild-type protein would be degraded along with the mutant, leading to a loss of function. This would be option D.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y protein doesn't cause degradation but just forms non-functional dimers, then the wild-type protein is still present but tied up in non-functional complexes. In that case, the molecular phenotype would be the presence of non-functional dimers, but the proteins aren't aggregated or degraded. However, none of the options mention this scenario.\n\nGiven the options provided, I need to choose between C and D. The question states that mutation Y is dominant-negative. Dominant-negative often involves the mutant interfering with the wild-type's function. If the mutant causes the wild-type protein to be non-functional by forming a complex that is then degraded, that would be D. If the mutant causes aggregation, that's C.\n\nWhich is more likely? I think in many cases, dominant-negative mutations result in the formation of non-functional complexes rather than aggregation or degradation. However, sometimes the improper complexes can lead to degradation. For example, if a protein must form a dimer to be stable, then monomers might be degraded. If mutation Y prevents dimerization, then both mutant and wild-type proteins might be monomers and thus degraded. But in this case, the mutation is in the dimerization domain, so perhaps the mutant can't form dimers, leading to monomers. If the wild-type protein can still dimerize with itself, then maybe only the mutant is degraded. But if the presence of the mutant somehow causes the wild-type to remain monomeric and thus be degraded, then D would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the wild-type can still dimerize with itself, then even in the presence of mutant Y, some wild-type dimers would form. But if the mutant Y competes for binding, perhaps reducing the number of wild-type dimers. However, this is getting too detailed.\n\nAnother angle: the question says mutation Y is in the dimerization domain and acts as a dominant-negative. So the key issue is dimerization. If the dimerization is prevented, then the transcription factor can't function. But how does a heterozygous mutation Y act as dominant-negative? Because even if one allele is normal, the product of the normal allele can't form functional dimers because the mutant Y subunits interfere.\n\nWait, maybe the mutant Y subunits can still dimerize but the dimer is non-functional. For example, if the dimerization domain is necessary for proper conformation, a mutant Y might allow dimerization but the resulting dimer can't translocate to the nucleus or activate transcription. In that case, the presence of Y would lead to dimers that are non-functional. But the wild-type subunits would form some functional dimers. However, in a heterozygous individual, half the subunits are Y and half are wild-type. The chance of a wild-type dimer is 25%, so only 25% activity. That's a dominant-negative effect. But the molecular phenotype here is the presence of non-functional dimers, not aggregation or degradation. But none of the options state that.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y subunits bind to wild-type subunits and prevent their dimerization, causing them to remain as monomers. If monomers are unstable and get degraded, then the wild-type protein would be degraded when bound to Y. That would fit option D: protein degradation and loss of function of the wild-type allele.\n\nAlternatively, if monomers are stable but just can't function, then the phenotype is loss of function due to lack of dimerization, but the proteins aren't degraded. But again, the options don't have that.\n\nGiven the options, I think D is a possibility if the mutant Y causes the wild-type protein to be degraded. But I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think: recessive loss-of-function mutations (like X) require both copies to be inactive. Dominant-negative mutations (like Y) mean that even one copy disrupts the function. So in Y's case, the presence of the mutant protein interferes with the normal protein's function.\n\nIf Y is in the dimerization domain, the mutant protein might form a dimer with the wild-type protein, but this dimer can't function. If these non-functional dimers are then targeted for degradation, then the wild-type protein is degraded along with the mutant, leading to loss of function. That would be D.\n\nAlternatively, if the dimer is formed but non-functional and not degraded, then the phenotype is due to non-functional dimers. But the question asks for the molecular phenotype observed. The options are about what's happening at the protein level.\n\nIf the proteins are forming dimers that can't function, the molecular phenotype is loss of dimerization function. But none of the options say that. Option C says aggregation, which is clumping of proteins, but that's different from non-functional dimers. Option D says degradation, which is the proteins being broken down.\n\nIn some cases, when proteins are part of a complex that's improperly formed, the cell's quality control systems mark them for degradation. For example, if a protein must form a dimer to be stable, failure to dimerize could lead to ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. So if the mutant Y prevents dimerization, both the mutant and wild-type proteins might be degraded because they can't form dimers. But wait, the wild-type protein could potentially dimerize with itself. However, if the mutant Y is present and can't dimerize, maybe the wild-type is outnumbered or the presence of Y monomers somehow interferes.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutant Y can form a dimer with the wild-type but it's a structurally abnormal dimer that's recognized as misfolded and targeted for degradation. In that case, the wild-type protein is being pulled into these abnormal dimers and degraded, hence D is correct.\n\n",
