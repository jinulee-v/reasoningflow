        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the velocity of particle A produced in the annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide and produce two A+ and two A- particles. The given information is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of each A particle is 300 MeV/c\u00b2. The answer choices are in terms of fractions of the speed of light, so I need to calculate the velocity and see which one matches.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in particle physics, when dealing with annihilation or creation processes, conservation laws are key. The main ones here would be conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. Since the problem mentions the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe I can approximate its kinetic energy as negligible? That might simplify things.\n\nSo, if the antiproton is at rest (or moving very slowly), then the proton and antiproton are annihilating each other at rest. Wait, but protons and antiprotons usually annihilate when they meet. However, if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the proton is at rest? Wait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving,\" so perhaps the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving slowly towards it. But in that case, the total initial momentum might not be zero. Hmm.\n\nWait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So perhaps we can treat the initial system as approximately at rest in the lab frame? Because if the antiproton is moving slowly, its velocity is low, so gamma is close to 1, and kinetic energy is negligible. Then the total initial energy would be the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton. Since protons and antiprotons have the same mass, their rest energy is each m_p c\u00b2. So total initial energy is 2 m_p c\u00b2.\n\nThen, the final state is four particles: two A+ and two A-. Each A particle has mass 300 MeV/c\u00b2. So the rest mass energy of each A is 300 MeV. Since there are four of them, the total rest mass energy would be 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. But wait, protons are much heavier. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So 2 m_p c\u00b2 would be 2 * 938 MeV \u2248 1876 MeV. So the initial energy is 1876 MeV, and the final rest mass energy is 1200 MeV. That leaves some energy left over for kinetic energy. So the produced A particles must have kinetic energy.\n\nBut since the initial momentum is approximately zero (if antiproton is moving slowly, and proton is at rest), then the total momentum of the final particles must also be zero. That means the four A particles must be emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel out. Since there are two positive and two negative particles, perhaps they are emitted in pairs moving in opposite directions?\n\nBut regardless, each A particle must have the same speed, assuming symmetry. Because otherwise, how would the momenta cancel? If there are two A+ and two A-, maybe they are produced in pairs moving in opposite directions. For example, two A+ go in opposite directions, and two A- also go in opposite directions. But then each pair would have zero net momentum. Alternatively, maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions. But since there are two of each, perhaps each pair has opposite momentum vectors.\n\nBut regardless, if the total momentum is zero, then each particle must have equal and opposite momentum vectors. So perhaps each A+ has a counterpart moving in the opposite direction, same speed. Similarly for A-. So all four particles have the same speed, but arranged symmetrically so that their momenta cancel.\n\nTherefore, if I can calculate the energy and momentum for each particle, assuming that they all have the same speed, then I can use conservation of energy and momentum to find that speed.\n\nSo let's model this. The initial energy is 2 m_p c\u00b2 (since proton and antiproton are at rest, approximately). The final energy is 4 times the energy of each A particle. Each A has energy E_A = \u03b3 m_A c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. So total final energy is 4 \u03b3 m_A c\u00b2. By conservation of energy:\n\n2 m_p c\u00b2 = 4 \u03b3 m_A c\u00b2\n\nSolving for \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = (2 m_p c\u00b2) / (4 m_A c\u00b2) = (2 * 938 MeV) / (4 * 300 MeV) = (1876) / (1200) \u2248 1.5633\n\nSo \u03b3 \u2248 1.5633. Then, we need to find the velocity v corresponding to this \u03b3.\n\nRecall that \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2). So solving for v:\n\nsqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 / \u03b3\n\n1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 / \u03b3\u00b2\n\nv\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1 / \u03b3\u00b2\n\nv = c sqrt(1 - 1 / \u03b3\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in \u03b3 \u2248 1.5633:\n\n1 / \u03b3\u00b2 \u2248 1 / (1.5633)\u00b2 \u2248 1 / 2.444 \u2248 0.409\n\nSo 1 - 0.409 \u2248 0.591\n\nv \u2248 c * sqrt(0.591) \u2248 c * 0.769 \u2248 0.769c\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option B is 0.77c. So that would be the answer. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, but hold on. Did I make an assumption that all four A particles have the same speed? If they do, then their total momentum would be zero only if their directions are arranged symmetrically. But even if their speeds are the same, but directions are opposite, then the total momentum cancels. So that's a valid scenario.\n\nBut let me verify if the calculation is correct. Let's recast the numbers:\n\nm_p c\u00b2 = 938 MeV\n\nm_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV\n\nInitial energy: 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV\n\nFinal energy: 4 * \u03b3 * 300 MeV\n\nSet equal:\n\n4 * \u03b3 * 300 = 1876\n\n\u03b3 = 1876 / (4 * 300) = 1876 / 1200 \u2248 1.5633\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen \u03b3 \u2248 1.5633\n\nCompute v:\n\nv = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2248 c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 1/2.444) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 0.409) \u2248 sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769c\n\nSo approximately 0.77c, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, the answer options include 0.77c (B) and 0.86c (C). Hmm. Let me check if my assumption is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I oversimplified. Because in reality, even if the initial antiproton is moving slowly, the proton might not be at rest. Wait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has a small velocity. Then, the total initial momentum is not zero. Therefore, the final momentum must equal the initial momentum.\n\nBut if the antiproton is moving slowly, then its momentum is approximately m_p v, where v is small. But if v is very small, then the kinetic energy is negligible, but the momentum is not zero. However, if the velocity is very low, then the momentum is m_p v, which is non-zero. Therefore, the final particles must have a net momentum equal to the initial momentum.\n\nBut if the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, but doesn't specify the frame of reference. Maybe we are to assume the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly. Then, the initial momentum is that of the antiproton, which is non-zero. However, if the velocity is very low, then the kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c\u00b2. But the initial momentum is m_p v, where v is the antiproton's velocity.\n\nBut if the velocity is very low, then m_p v is small. However, in the final state, the four particles must have a total momentum equal to the initial momentum. If the initial momentum is small, then the final momentum must also be small. But if the A particles are moving relativistically, their momenta would be significant. Therefore, perhaps the only way for the total momentum to be small is if the A particles are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out almost completely, except for a small net momentum equal to the initial one.\n\nBut if the initial momentum is very small (since the antiproton is moving slowly), maybe we can approximate the final momentum as zero? That is, neglect the initial momentum compared to the momenta of the A particles. If that's the case, then the calculation I did earlier would hold, assuming total initial momentum is zero, leading to v \u2248 0.77c, answer B.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the antiproton is slowly moving\". If \"slowly moving\" implies that it's non-relativistic, so its kinetic energy is negligible, but its momentum is not zero. However, if the proton is at rest, then the initial momentum is just the antiproton's momentum. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, then its momentum is m_p v, where v << c. But in the final state, the four A particles must have a total momentum equal to m_p v. However, since the A particles are much lighter (m_A = 300 MeV/c\u00b2 vs m_p = 938 MeV/c\u00b2), their momenta would be higher for the same velocity. But if their velocities are relativistic, their momenta would be \u03b3 m_A v.\n\nBut this complicates things because the initial momentum is small, but the final momenta could be larger. However, maybe the problem is intended to be treated in the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, but if the antiproton is moving slowly in the lab frame (proton at rest), then the center-of-momentum frame would be moving with some velocity relative to the lab frame.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is intended to assume that the initial system is at rest. But how? If the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, then the system isn't at rest. Unless the problem is considering the center-of-mass frame. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the frame. Usually, in such problems, if not specified, it's the lab frame. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the lab frame is approximately the rest frame of the proton. But then, the total initial momentum is not zero.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem expects me to assume that the initial system is at rest, so total momentum is zero, leading to the previous calculation. But why would the problem mention that the antiproton is slowly moving? Maybe it's a hint that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has low velocity, so that the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c\u00b2, and the total initial momentum is approximately m_p v. But if v is small, then m_p v is small. However, the final particles must have a total momentum equal to m_p v. But if the A particles are moving relativistically, their momenta would be much larger than m_p v unless their velocities are arranged to cancel out.\n\nBut if the initial momentum is small, maybe the problem is expecting us to ignore it and assume the initial total momentum is zero? That would make the problem solvable with the given information. Otherwise, we don't know the antiproton's velocity, just that it's \"slowly moving\", which is vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in the center-of-mass frame. Let's check. The center-of-mass frame would have the total initial momentum zero if both particles are moving towards each other with equal and opposite momenta. But if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly, then the center-of-mass frame is moving relative to the lab frame.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to be solved in the center-of-mass frame. Let's see. To compute the center-of-mass energy, we need to calculate the total energy squared, which is (E_total)^2 = (E_p + E_pbar)^2 - (p_p c + p_pbar c)^2. If the proton is at rest, E_p = m_p c\u00b2, p_p = 0. The antiproton has E_pbar = \u03b3 m_p c\u00b2, and p_pbar = \u03b3 m_p v. If the antiproton is moving slowly, then \u03b3 \u2248 1, so E_pbar \u2248 m_p c\u00b2, and p_pbar \u2248 m_p v. Then, the total energy squared is (m_p c\u00b2 + m_p c\u00b2)^2 - (m_p v c)^2 \u2248 (2 m_p c\u00b2)^2 - (m_p v c)^2. But since v is small, the second term is negligible compared to the first, so E_total \u2248 2 m_p c\u00b2. Therefore, the center-of-mass energy is approximately 2 m_p c\u00b2, same as if they were both at rest. Therefore, in the center-of-mass frame, the calculation I did earlier applies: total energy is 2 m_p c\u00b2, and the four A particles are produced at rest? No, wait, no. Wait, in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the four A particles must have zero net momentum. Therefore, their momenta must cancel out. If they are all emitted with the same speed, symmetrically, then their momenta would cancel. Therefore, the same calculation applies: each A particle has \u03b3 m_A c\u00b2, total energy 4 \u03b3 m_A c\u00b2 = 2 m_p c\u00b2, leading to \u03b3 \u2248 1.5633, velocity \u2248 0.77c.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the center-of-mass frame is necessary here. If the problem is in the lab frame, with proton at rest and antiproton moving slowly, then the initial momentum is not zero, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. If the velocity is so small that its momentum is negligible compared to the momenta of the A particles, then we can approximate the initial momentum as zero. But if that's the case, then the calculation holds. However, if the initial momentum is not negligible, then the problem becomes more complicated because we have to conserve both energy and momentum.\n\nBut given that the answer choices are all relativistic speeds (0.77c and up), and the rest mass of A is 300 MeV, which is less than the proton's rest mass, so the produced particles would need to have significant kinetic energy. Therefore, perhaps the initial approximation of treating the problem in the center-of-mass frame where total momentum is zero is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to ignore the initial momentum and just use energy conservation. But strictly speaking, both energy and momentum should be conserved. However, if the initial momentum is small, maybe the velocity of the A particles is determined primarily by energy conservation, with momentum conservation only requiring that their momenta cancel, which would be satisfied if they are emitted symmetrically.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with the initial calculation, the velocity is approximately 0.77c, answer B.\n\nBut wait, let me check with exact calculation. Let's suppose that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_pbar. Then, the total initial energy is E_total = m_p c\u00b2 + \u03b3 m_p c\u00b2, where \u03b3 is for the antiproton. The total initial momentum is p_total = \u03b3 m_p v_pbar.\n\nAfter the collision, four A particles are produced. Let's assume that they are emitted in pairs: two moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction, each with speed v. Then, the total momentum of the two in +x is 2 \u03b3_A m_A v, and the two in -x is -2 \u03b3_A m_A v. So total momentum is zero. But this contradicts the initial momentum p_total = \u03b3 m_p v_pbar. Therefore, unless the initial momentum is zero, the final momentum can't be zero. Therefore, in the lab frame, if the initial momentum is non-zero, the final particles can't all have their momenta canceled out. Therefore, the assumption that they are emitted symmetrically is invalid unless the initial momentum is zero.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be considered in the center-of-mass frame where initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the calculation leading to 0.77c is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in the lab frame, but the antiproton's velocity is so low that its kinetic energy is negligible, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c\u00b2, and the initial momentum is approximately m_p v_pbar. Then, the final particles must have total momentum equal to m_p v_pbar. However, if the A particles are moving relativistically, their momenta would be much larger than m_p v_pbar unless their velocities are arranged to almost cancel, leaving a small net momentum. But this complicates the problem, and without knowing v_pbar, we can't solve it. Therefore, the problem must be intended to be solved in the center-of-mass frame where initial momentum is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, 0.77c.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let's use relativistic energy and momentum conservation.\n\nIn the lab frame: proton at rest, antiproton moving with velocity v. So initial momentum is p_initial = \u03b3 m_p v. Initial energy is E_initial = m_p c\u00b2 + \u03b3 m_p c\u00b2.\n\nAfter collision, four A particles. Let's assume they are divided into two pairs moving in opposite directions with speed u. So two A+ and two A- moving in opposite directions. Each A has momentum \u03b3_A m_A u. So total momentum is 2 \u03b3_A m_A u - 2 \u03b3_A m_A u = 0. But initial momentum is p_initial = \u03b3 m_p v. Therefore, unless p_initial = 0, this can't hold. Therefore, unless we are in the center-of-mass frame, the momenta can't cancel out. Therefore, the problem must be in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nTherefore, in the center-of-mass frame, total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, total final momentum must be zero. Therefore, the four A particles must be emitted symmetrically with zero net momentum. Therefore, each A has the same speed, and arranged such that their momenta cancel. Therefore, energy conservation gives:\n\n2 m_p c\u00b2 = 4 \u03b3 m_A c\u00b2\n\nTherefore, \u03b3 = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) = (938)/(2*300) \u2248 938/600 \u2248 1.5633\n\nThen, velocity v = c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2248 c sqrt(1 - 1/(1.5633)^2) \u2248 c sqrt(1 - 0.409) \u2248 c sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769c \u2248 0.77c, which is option B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me check the mass of the proton again. The problem states m_A c\u00b2 = 300 MeV. Proton mass is approximately 938 MeV/c\u00b2. So yes, 2 m_p c\u00b2 = 1876 MeV, and 4 m_A c\u00b2 = 1200 MeV. The difference is 676 MeV, which is the total kinetic energy of the four A particles. So each A particle has 169 MeV of kinetic energy. Then, the total energy per A is 300 + 169 = 469 MeV. Then, \u03b3 = 469 / 300 \u2248 1.563, which matches. Then velocity is sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 1/2.444) \u2248 sqrt(0.591) \u2248 0.769c.\n\nYes, so 0.77c is correct. Therefore, the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, the given answer options include 0.86c and 0.91c. Could there be a mistake in assuming that all four particles share the energy equally? Maybe not. Because in the center-of-mass frame, particles are typically produced symmetrically, so they would have the same energy and speed. Therefore, the calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each pair of A+ and A- are produced at rest, but that doesn't make sense because their rest mass energy is 2*300 + 2*300 = 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial energy 1876 MeV. So they must be moving.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B, 0.77c."
