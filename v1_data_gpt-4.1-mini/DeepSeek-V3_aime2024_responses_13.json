        "response": "Alright, I have this problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit positive integer \\( N \\) with a specific property. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what's being asked:\n\n- **\\( N \\)**: A four-digit positive integer.\n- **Property**: If any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.\n- **Goal**: Find the greatest such \\( N \\), then divide it by 1000 to get quotient \\( Q \\) and remainder \\( R \\), and finally compute \\( Q + R \\).\n\nOkay, so I need to find the largest four-digit number where, no matter which digit I change to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, I'll perform some arithmetic with that number to find \\( Q + R \\).\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\nLet's denote \\( N \\) as a four-digit number: \\( N = ABCD \\), where \\( A, B, C, D \\) are its digits, and \\( A \\) is between 1 and 9 (since it's a four-digit number), while \\( B, C, D \\) are between 0 and 9.\n\nThe property says that if I change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, there are four cases:\n\n1. Change \\( A \\) to 1: The number becomes \\( 1BCD \\), which is divisible by 7.\n2. Change \\( B \\) to 1: The number becomes \\( A1CD \\), which is divisible by 7.\n3. Change \\( C \\) to 1: The number becomes \\( AB1D \\), which is divisible by 7.\n4. Change \\( D \\) to 1: The number becomes \\( ABC1 \\), which is divisible by 7.\n\nSo, \\( N \\) must satisfy all four conditions simultaneously.\n\n### Approach\n\nSince \\( N \\) is a four-digit number, and we're looking for the greatest such number, it makes sense to start from the largest four-digit number, which is 9999, and work our way down until we find a number that satisfies all four conditions.\n\nHowever, checking every number from 9999 downwards would be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nLet's think about the conditions:\n\n1. \\( 1BCD \\) is divisible by 7.\n2. \\( A1CD \\) is divisible by 7.\n3. \\( AB1D \\) is divisible by 7.\n4. \\( ABC1 \\) is divisible by 7.\n\nPerhaps we can express these conditions mathematically and find relationships between the digits.\n\n### Expressing Conditions Mathematically\n\nLet's express \\( N \\) in terms of its digits:\n\n\\[ N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D \\]\n\nNow, let's express each modified number:\n\n1. \\( 1BCD = 1000 \\times 1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D \\)\n2. \\( A1CD = 1000A + 100 \\times 1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D \\)\n3. \\( AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 \\times 1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D \\)\n4. \\( ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 \\)\n\nEach of these must be divisible by 7.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. \\( 1000 + 100B + 10C + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n2. \\( 1000A + 100 + 10C + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n3. \\( 1000A + 100B + 10 + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n4. \\( 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can simplify it.\n\n### Simplifying the Congruences\n\nFirst, let's simplify the coefficients modulo 7.\n\nCompute \\( 1000 \\mod 7 \\), \\( 100 \\mod 7 \\), \\( 10 \\mod 7 \\):\n\n- \\( 1000 \\div 7 = 142 \\) with a remainder of 6, so \\( 1000 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( 100 \\div 7 = 14 \\) with a remainder of 2, so \\( 100 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7} \\)\n- \\( 10 \\div 7 = 1 \\) with a remainder of 3, so \\( 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nNow, rewrite each congruence:\n\n1. \\( 6 + 2B + 3C + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n2. \\( 6A + 2 + 3C + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n3. \\( 6A + 2B + 3 + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n4. \\( 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nNow, we have a system of four congruences:\n\n1. \\( 6 + 2B + 3C + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n2. \\( 6A + 2 + 3C + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n3. \\( 6A + 2B + 3 + D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n4. \\( 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nThis still looks complicated, but maybe we can find relationships between \\( A, B, C, D \\).\n\n### Finding Relationships Between Digits\n\nLet's subtract congruence 1 from congruence 2:\n\n\\[ (6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) \\equiv 0 - 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A + 2 - 6 - 2B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A - 4 - 2B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A - 2B \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nSimilarly, subtract congruence 1 from congruence 3:\n\n\\[ (6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) \\equiv 0 - 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A + 3 - 6 - 3C \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A - 3 - 3C \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A - 3C \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nAnd subtract congruence 1 from congruence 4:\n\n\\[ (6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) \\equiv 0 - 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A + 1 - 6 - D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A - 5 - D \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ 6A - D \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nNow, we have three new congruences:\n\n1. \\( 6A - 2B \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\)\n2. \\( 6A - 3C \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\)\n3. \\( 6A - D \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\)\n\nThis seems more manageable. Let's try to express \\( B, C, D \\) in terms of \\( A \\).\n\n### Solving for \\( B, C, D \\) in Terms of \\( A \\)\n\nFrom congruence 1:\n\n\\[ 6A - 2B \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ -2B \\equiv 4 - 6A \\pmod{7} \\]\nMultiply both sides by the modular inverse of -2 modulo 7. The inverse of -2 is 3, since \\( -2 \\times 3 = -6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\n\\[ B \\equiv 3(4 - 6A) \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ B \\equiv 12 - 18A \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ B \\equiv 5 - 4A \\pmod{7} \\] (since \\( 12 \\equiv 5 \\) and \\( -18 \\equiv -4 \\) modulo 7)\n\nFrom congruence 2:\n\n\\[ 6A - 3C \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ -3C \\equiv 3 - 6A \\pmod{7} \\]\nMultiply both sides by the inverse of -3 modulo 7. The inverse of -3 is 2, since \\( -3 \\times 2 = -6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\n\\[ C \\equiv 2(3 - 6A) \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 12A \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 5A \\pmod{7} \\] (since \\( -12 \\equiv -5 \\) modulo 7)\n\nFrom congruence 3:\n\n\\[ 6A - D \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ -D \\equiv 5 - 6A \\pmod{7} \\]\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\[ D \\equiv -5 + 6A \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ D \\equiv 2 + 6A \\pmod{7} \\] (since \\( -5 \\equiv 2 \\) modulo 7)\n\nNow, we have:\n\n\\[ B \\equiv 5 - 4A \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 5A \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ D \\equiv 2 + 6A \\pmod{7} \\]\n\n### Determining Possible Values for \\( A \\)\n\nSince \\( A \\) is the first digit of a four-digit number, \\( A \\) can be from 1 to 9. However, \\( B, C, D \\) are digits from 0 to 9. So, we need to find \\( A \\) such that \\( B, C, D \\) are within 0 to 9.\n\nLet's iterate \\( A \\) from 9 downwards and see which values satisfy the conditions.\n\n#### Testing \\( A = 9 \\)\n\nCompute \\( B, C, D \\):\n\n\\[ B \\equiv 5 - 4 \\times 9 = 5 - 36 = -31 \\equiv -31 + 5 \\times 7 = -31 + 35 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 5 \\times 9 = 6 - 45 = -39 \\equiv -39 + 6 \\times 7 = -39 + 42 = 3 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ D \\equiv 2 + 6 \\times 9 = 2 + 54 = 56 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nSo, \\( B = 4 \\), \\( C = 3 \\), \\( D = 0 \\).\n\nNow, check if \\( N = 9430 \\) satisfies all original conditions.\n\n1. Change \\( A \\) to 1: \\( 1430 \\)\n   - \\( 1430 \\div 7 = 204.285... \\) Not divisible by 7.\n   \nSince \\( A = 9 \\) doesn't work, let's try \\( A = 8 \\).\n\n#### Testing \\( A = 8 \\)\n\nCompute \\( B, C, D \\):\n\n\\[ B \\equiv 5 - 4 \\times 8 = 5 - 32 = -27 \\equiv -27 + 4 \\times 7 = -27 + 28 = 1 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 5 \\times 8 = 6 - 40 = -34 \\equiv -34 + 5 \\times 7 = -34 + 35 = 1 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ D \\equiv 2 + 6 \\times 8 = 2 + 48 = 50 \\equiv 50 - 7 \\times 7 = 50 - 49 = 1 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nSo, \\( B = 1 \\), \\( C = 1 \\), \\( D = 1 \\).\n\nNow, check if \\( N = 8111 \\) satisfies all original conditions.\n\n1. Change \\( A \\) to 1: \\( 1111 \\)\n   - \\( 1111 \\div 7 = 158.714... \\) Not divisible by 7.\n\nSo, \\( A = 8 \\) doesn't work. Let's try \\( A = 7 \\).\n\n#### Testing \\( A = 7 \\)\n\nCompute \\( B, C, D \\):\n\n\\[ B \\equiv 5 - 4 \\times 7 = 5 - 28 = -23 \\equiv -23 + 4 \\times 7 = -23 + 28 = 5 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 5 \\times 7 = 6 - 35 = -29 \\equiv -29 + 5 \\times 7 = -29 + 35 = 6 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ D \\equiv 2 + 6 \\times 7 = 2 + 42 = 44 \\equiv 44 - 6 \\times 7 = 44 - 42 = 2 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nSo, \\( B = 5 \\), \\( C = 6 \\), \\( D = 2 \\).\n\nNow, check if \\( N = 7562 \\) satisfies all original conditions.\n\n1. Change \\( A \\) to 1: \\( 1562 \\)\n   - \\( 1562 \\div 7 = 223.142... \\) Not divisible by 7.\n\nSo, \\( A = 7 \\) doesn't work. Let's try \\( A = 6 \\).\n\n#### Testing \\( A = 6 \\)\n\nCompute \\( B, C, D \\):\n\n\\[ B \\equiv 5 - 4 \\times 6 = 5 - 24 = -19 \\equiv -19 + 3 \\times 7 = -19 + 21 = 2 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 5 \\times 6 = 6 - 30 = -24 \\equiv -24 + 4 \\times 7 = -24 + 28 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ D \\equiv 2 + 6 \\times 6 = 2 + 36 = 38 \\equiv 38 - 5 \\times 7 = 38 - 35 = 3 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nSo, \\( B = 2 \\), \\( C = 4 \\), \\( D = 3 \\).\n\nNow, check if \\( N = 6243 \\) satisfies all original conditions.\n\n1. Change \\( A \\) to 1: \\( 1243 \\)\n   - \\( 1243 \\div 7 = 177.571... \\) Not divisible by 7.\n\nSo, \\( A = 6 \\) doesn't work. Let's try \\( A = 5 \\).\n\n#### Testing \\( A = 5 \\)\n\nCompute \\( B, C, D \\):\n\n\\[ B \\equiv 5 - 4 \\times 5 = 5 - 20 = -15 \\equiv -15 + 3 \\times 7 = -15 + 21 = 6 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 5 \\times 5 = 6 - 25 = -19 \\equiv -19 + 3 \\times 7 = -19 + 21 = 2 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ D \\equiv 2 + 6 \\times 5 = 2 + 30 = 32 \\equiv 32 - 4 \\times 7 = 32 - 28 = 4 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nSo, \\( B = 6 \\), \\( C = 2 \\), \\( D = 4 \\).\n\nNow, check if \\( N = 5624 \\) satisfies all original conditions.\n\n1. Change \\( A \\) to 1: \\( 1624 \\)\n   - \\( 1624 \\div 7 = 232 \\) Exactly divisible by 7.\n2. Change \\( B \\) to 1: \\( 5124 \\)\n   - \\( 5124 \\div 7 = 732 \\) Exactly divisible by 7.\n3. Change \\( C \\) to 1: \\( 5614 \\)\n   - \\( 5614 \\div 7 = 802 \\) Exactly divisible by 7.\n4. Change \\( D \\) to 1: \\( 5621 \\)\n   - \\( 5621 \\div 7 = 803 \\) Exactly divisible by 7.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied! So, \\( N = 5624 \\) is a valid number.\n\nBut we need the greatest such number. We've checked \\( A = 9 \\) down to \\( A = 5 \\), and \\( A = 5 \\) works. Let's check \\( A = 4 \\) to ensure there isn't a larger number.\n\n#### Testing \\( A = 4 \\)\n\nCompute \\( B, C, D \\):\n\n\\[ B \\equiv 5 - 4 \\times 4 = 5 - 16 = -11 \\equiv -11 + 2 \\times 7 = -11 + 14 = 3 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ C \\equiv 6 - 5 \\times 4 = 6 - 20 = -14 \\equiv -14 + 2 \\times 7 = -14 + 14 = 0 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\\[ D \\equiv 2 + 6 \\times 4 = 2 + 24 = 26 \\equiv 26 - 3 \\times 7 = 26 - 21 = 5 \\pmod{7} \\]\n\nSo, \\( B = 3 \\), \\( C = 0 \\), \\( D = 5 \\).\n\nNow, check if \\( N = 4305 \\) satisfies all original conditions.\n\n1.
