        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the spin operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The components P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as \u0127/2 times the Pauli matrices \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z respectively. Wait, but the problem says the operator is called P, not spin, but the matrices given are the Pauli matrices. So maybe P here is the spin operator? Because the Pauli matrices are usually associated with spin-1/2 systems. So, muon is a spin-1/2 particle, so this makes sense.\n\nThe direction n is in the x-z plane. So, since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component of the direction vector is zero. So, the unit vector n can be parametrized as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Because in spherical coordinates, if we're in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle \u03c6 is zero, so the direction is (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8). So, the operator along direction n would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. Therefore, P_n = sin\u03b8 P_x + cos\u03b8 P_z.\n\nGiven that P_x is (\u0127/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], P_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, substituting these into P_n:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2)(sin\u03b8 [[0,1],[1,0]] + cos\u03b8 [[1,0],[0,-1]])\n\nSo, let's compute that matrix:\n\nFirst term: sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, 0]]\n\nSecond term: cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nThen multiply by \u0127/2:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the second term is [[cos\u03b8, 0], [0, -cos\u03b8]], so when adding the two matrices:\n\nFirst component: cos\u03b8 + 0 = cos\u03b8\n\nSecond component: 0 + sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8\n\nThird component: sin\u03b8 + 0 = sin\u03b8\n\nFourth component: 0 + (-cos\u03b8) = -cos\u03b8\n\nSo yes, the matrix is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] multiplied by \u0127/2.\n\nNow, we need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. So, let's denote the matrix as (\u0127/2) * M, where M is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]. Then the eigenvalues of P_n would be (\u0127/2) times the eigenvalues of M. So, if we need the eigenvalue to be +\u0127/2, then the corresponding eigenvalue of M must be +1.\n\nSo, let's find the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue +1.\n\nSo, solving (M - I)v = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n\nSo, M - I = [[cos\u03b8 - 1, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8 - 1]]\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\n(cos\u03b8 - 1) v_1 + sin\u03b8 v_2 = 0\n\nsin\u03b8 v_1 + (-cos\u03b8 -1) v_2 = 0\n\nWe need to solve these equations. Let's take the first equation:\n\n(cos\u03b8 - 1) v_1 + sin\u03b8 v_2 = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v_2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v_1\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v_1 = (cos\u03b8 + 1) v_2\n\nSo, let's see if these two equations are consistent.\n\nFrom the first equation: v_2 = [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v_1\n\nFrom the second equation: v_1 = [(cos\u03b8 + 1)/sin\u03b8] v_2\n\nSubstitute v_2 from the first equation into the second equation:\n\nv_1 = [(cos\u03b8 + 1)/sin\u03b8] * [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v_1\n\nMultiply numerator: (cos\u03b8 +1)(1 - cos\u03b8) = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo, v_1 = [sin\u00b2\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8] v_1 => v_1 = v_1, which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the eigenvectors are proportional to [1, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8]\n\nBut let's simplify (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8.\n\nUsing the identity (1 - cos\u03b8) = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), and sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo, the eigenvector is proportional to [1, tan(\u03b8/2)]\n\nBut tan(\u03b8/2) = sin\u03b8/(1 + cos\u03b8) as well, but here we have tan(\u03b8/2) = (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8, which is equivalent.\n\nSo, the eigenvector is [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] up to a normalization factor.\n\nTo normalize, we need to compute the norm squared: 1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so the norm is sec(\u03b8/2). Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)], because:\n\nIf we have [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] multiplied by cos(\u03b8/2), we get [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]\n\nBecause tan(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2), so multiplying by cos(\u03b8/2) gives sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]\n\nLooking at the options, option A is (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)), which matches.\n\nBut wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvalue equation.\n\nWait, the operator P_n is (\u0127/2) M, and we want P_n |v> = (\u0127/2) |v>\n\nSo, M |v> = |v>\n\nSo, solving M |v> = |v>\n\nSo, M is [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo, writing out the equations:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2\n\nSo, first equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = v1 => (cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 - cos\u03b8 v2 = v2 => sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 +1) v2 = 0\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, solving (cos\u03b8 -1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1\n\nSo, v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 v1\n\nAgain, same as before.\n\nExpressed in terms of \u03b8/2:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2) / (2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)) ) = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo, v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1\n\nTherefore, eigenvector is [1, tan(\u03b8/2)] up to normalization.\n\nNormalizing:\n\n1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so normalization factor is cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)]\n\nWhich is option A.\n\nBut let me check the other options.\n\nOption B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). But since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 = 0, so e^{i\u03c6} =1. But \u03b8 here is the angle from z-axis. However, eigenvectors for spin in direction (\u03b8, \u03c6) are usually given as [cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)], which is similar to option B but with \u03b8/2. So option B has \u03b8 instead of \u03b8/2, which is incorrect.\n\nOption C and D have sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which don't seem related here. Also, they include \u0127, but eigenvectors shouldn't have \u0127 in them because they are vectors in the state space, not operators. So options C and D are probably incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: (cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2))\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis. Then, the spinor in the direction n is indeed [cos(\u03b8/2), e^{i\u03c6} sin(\u03b8/2)]. Since \u03c6=0 here, because it's in the x-z plane, so \u03c6=0. Therefore, the eigenvector should be [cos(\u03b8/2), sin(\u03b8/2)], which is exactly option A. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
