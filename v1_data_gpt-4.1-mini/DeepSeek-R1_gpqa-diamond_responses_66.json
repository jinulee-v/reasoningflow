        "response": "Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. The question is asking for the joint probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u0127. The given coupled state is |1, 1, 2, -1>. The options are A through D, with possible answers 0, 1/2, 2/3, or 1. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how coupled angular momentum states relate to uncoupled states. The coupled state |l1, l2, l, m\u27e9 is a combination of the uncoupled states |l1, m1\u27e9 \u2297 |l2, m2\u27e9. Since both electrons are in p orbitals, l1 = l2 = 1. The total angular momentum quantum numbers here are l = 2 and m = -1. So the coupled state |1, 1, 2, -1\u27e9 is a linear combination of the uncoupled states where m1 + m2 = m_total = -1.\n\nTo find the probability of both electrons having m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, I need to find the coefficient of the |1, -1\u27e9 \u2297 |1, -1\u27e9 state in the expansion of |1, 1, 2, -1\u27e9. Then, the square of the absolute value of that coefficient will be the probability.\n\nBut wait, if m1 and m2 are both -1, then their sum is -2. However, the total m here is -1. So m1 + m2 must equal -1. Therefore, the state |1, -1\u27e9 \u2297 |1, -1\u27e9 cannot contribute to |1, 1, 2, -1\u27e9 because their m values add up to -2, not -1. That would mean the coefficient for that particular state is zero, so the probability is zero. But let me check this more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to expand the coupled state into the uncoupled basis. The total angular momentum state |l, m\u27e9 = |2, -1\u27e9 can be written as a sum over m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1 of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients multiplied by |1, m1\u27e9 |1, m2\u27e9.\n\nSo, the possible m1 and m2 pairs that add up to -1 are:\n\nm1 = 0, m2 = -1\n\nm1 = -1, m2 = 0\n\nm1 = 1, m2 = -2 \u2192 but m2 can't be -2 because l2 = 1, so m2 can only be -1, 0, 1. So that's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, m1 = -2, m2 = 1 is invalid.\n\nSo the only valid combinations are (0, -1) and (-1, 0). Therefore, the coupled state |2, -1\u27e9 is a combination of |1, 0\u27e9 |1, -1\u27e9 and |1, -1\u27e9 |1, 0\u27e9.\n\nTherefore, the state |2, -1\u27e9 does not include the term |1, -1\u27e9 |1, -1\u27e9. Hence, the amplitude for both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero. So the answer should be A. 0.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this. Maybe I need to write down the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two l=1 states to get l=2, m=-1.\n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be calculated using the formula or looked up in a table. For two particles with l1 = l2 = 1, coupling to L = 2 and M = -1.\n\nThe general formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is:\n\n\u27e8l1, m1; l2, m2 | L, M\u27e9\n\nSo here, L = 2, M = -1. The possible m1 and m2 are such that m1 + m2 = M = -1. As before, m1 can be 0 and m2 = -1, or m1 = -1 and m2 = 0.\n\nThe coefficients for these can be found using the formula or symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, using ladder operators. The state |2, -1\u27e9 can be obtained by applying the lowering operator to |2, 0\u27e9, but maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, recall that for two l=1 states, the possible total L are 2, 1, 0. The state with L=2, M=-1 is a symmetric state? Wait, since electrons are identical particles, but the problem says to ignore their spin angular momentum. So maybe the spatial part has to be symmetric or antisymmetric depending on the spin, but the problem says to ignore spin, so maybe we don't have to worry about that. So perhaps the state is just a product state, but coupled.\n\nWait, but the coupled state |2, -1\u27e9 is a specific combination of the |m1, m2\u27e9 states. Let me check the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nLooking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.\n\nFrom tables or formulas, the coefficients are:\n\nFor |2, -1\u27e9:\n\nsqrt(1/2) |0, -1\u27e9 + sqrt(1/2) |-1, 0\u27e9\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The state |2, 2\u27e9 is |1, 1\u27e9 |1, 1\u27e9. Then applying the lowering operator:\n\nL- |2, 2\u27e9 = (L1- + L2-) |1,1\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9\n\nWhich gives sqrt(2*2 - 2*1) |2,1\u27e9 = sqrt(2) |2,1\u27e9\n\nBut also, L1- |1,1\u27e9 = sqrt(1*2 - 1*0) |1,0\u27e9 = sqrt(2) |1,0\u27e9\n\nSimilarly, L2- |1,1\u27e9 = sqrt(2) |1,0\u27e9\n\nSo L- |2,2\u27e9 = sqrt(2) |1,0\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9 + sqrt(2) |1,1\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9\n\nBut |2,1\u27e9 should be (|1,0\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9 + |1,1\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9)/sqrt(2)\n\nSimilarly, continuing to lower to get |2, -1\u27e9:\n\nStarting from |2,1\u27e9, apply L-:\n\nL- |2,1\u27e9 = sqrt(2*2 - 1*0) |2,0\u27e9 = sqrt(4) |2,0\u27e9 = 2 |2,0\u27e9\n\nBut also, applying L1- + L2- to |2,1\u27e9:\n\nWhich is (L1- + L2-)(|1,0\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9 + |1,1\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9)/sqrt(2)\n\nCompute L1- |1,0\u27e9 = sqrt(1*2 - 0*(-1)) |1,-1\u27e9 = sqrt(2) |1,-1\u27e9\n\nL1- |1,1\u27e9 = sqrt(2) |1,0\u27e9\n\nSimilarly, L2- |1,1\u27e9 = sqrt(2) |1,0\u27e9\n\nL2- |1,0\u27e9 = sqrt(1*2 - 0*(-1)) |1,-1\u27e9 = sqrt(2) |1,-1\u27e9\n\nSo:\n\n(L1- + L2-)(|1,0\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9 + |1,1\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9)/sqrt(2) =\n\n[ sqrt(2) |1,-1\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9 + sqrt(2) |1,0\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9 + sqrt(2) |1,0\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9 + sqrt(2) |1,1\u27e9 |1,-1\u27e9 ] / sqrt(2)\n\nSimplify:\n\n[ sqrt(2)( |1,-1\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9 + 2 |1,0\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9 + |1,1\u27e9 |1,-1\u27e9 ) ] / sqrt(2) =\n\n|1,-1\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9 + 2 |1,0\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9 + |1,1\u27e9 |1,-1\u27e9\n\nBut this should equal 2 |2,0\u27e9. Therefore, |2,0\u27e9 is ( |1,-1\u27e9 |1,1\u27e9 + 2 |1,0\u27e9 |1,0\u27e9 + |1,1\u27e9 |1,-1\u27e9 ) / sqrt(6) ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to normalize. The coefficients squared should add up to 1.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can refer to standard Clebsch-Gordan tables.\n\nLooking up Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for 1 \u2297 1 \u2192 2.\n\nFor L=2, M=-1:\n\nThe state |2, -1\u27e9 is composed of the combinations where m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1, m2 pairs are (0, -1) and (-1, 0). The coefficients for these can be found in tables.\n\nAccording to standard tables, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two l=1 states to get L=2, M=-1 are:\n\n\u27e81, 0; 1, -1 | 2, -1\u27e9 = sqrt(1/2)\n\n\u27e81, -1; 1, 0 | 2, -1\u27e9 = sqrt(1/2)\n\nTherefore, the coupled state |2, -1\u27e9 is:\n\nsqrt(1/2) |1, 0\u27e9 |1, -1\u27e9 + sqrt(1/2) |1, -1\u27e9 |1, 0\u27e9\n\nTherefore, in this state, the possible outcomes for (m1, m2) are (0, -1) and (-1, 0), each with probability |sqrt(1/2)|\u00b2 = 1/2. So the total probability is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, as expected.\n\nBut the question is asking for the joint probability where both m1 and m2 are -1. However, in the expansion above, there is no term with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Therefore, the coefficient for that term is zero, so the probability is zero. Therefore, the answer is A. 0.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the coupled state is only composed of those two terms. Let me confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the state |2, -1\u27e9 must be orthogonal to the |1, -1\u27e9 and |0, -1\u27e9 states in the L=1 and L=0 multiplets. But perhaps that's more involved.\n\nAlternatively, think about the possible states. For two p electrons (l1 = l2 = 1), the total angular momentum can be L=2, 1, 0. The state given is L=2, M=-1. The possible M values for L=2 are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. So M=-1 is achievable by combinations of m1 and m2 adding to -1. As we saw, the only possible pairs are (0, -1) and (-1, 0). Therefore, the state |2, -1\u27e9 cannot have any components where m1 and m2 are both -1, since that would give M=-2, which is a different state (|2, -2\u27e9).\n\nTherefore, the joint probability of both being -1 is indeed zero. So the answer is A. 0.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that the state could somehow include | -1, -1 \u27e9. For that, m1 + m2 = -2, which would correspond to the |2, -2\u27e9 state. But our state is |2, -1\u27e9, which is a different M. Since each M is unique for a given L, the |2, -1\u27e9 state cannot include any components with m1 + m2 \u2260 -1. Therefore, components with m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 are excluded, confirming that the probability is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
