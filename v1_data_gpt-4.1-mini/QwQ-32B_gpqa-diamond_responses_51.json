        "question": "Astronomers are studying a star with a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When the star's surface is not covered by dark spots, its Teff is 6000K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. What is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots? Note that the transition between the energy levels under consideration corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. Assume that the stellar photosphere is in LTE.\nA. ~7.8\nB. ~4.5\nC. ~1.1\nD. ~2.9",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The question mentions that the ratio decreases when there are spots, so the factor should be greater than 1. The options are A. ~7.8, B. ~4.5, C. ~1.1, D. ~2.9. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is:\n\nN\u2082/N\u2081 = (g\u2082/g\u2081) * exp(-\u0394E/(k_B T))\n\nWhere:\n- N\u2082 and N\u2081 are the number of atoms in the upper and lower levels,\n- g\u2082 and g\u2081 are the statistical weights of the levels,\n- \u0394E is the energy difference between the two levels,\n- k_B is Boltzmann's constant,\n- T is the temperature.\n\nSince the problem states that the ratio decreases when there are spots, that means the ratio N\u2082/N\u2081 is smaller when the star has spots. Therefore, when there are no spots, the ratio should be higher. The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So, we need to compute (N\u2082/N\u2081)_no_spots divided by (N\u2082/N\u2081)_spots.\n\nThe key here is that the temperature of the photosphere changes when there are spots. The effective temperature (T_eff) decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered by spots. Since the photosphere is in LTE, the temperature T in the Boltzmann equation is the effective temperature of the star. Therefore, the ratio of the populations depends exponentially on the inverse of the temperature.\n\nLet me write the ratio of the ratios:\n\n(N\u2082/N\u2081)_no_spots / (N\u2082/N\u2081)_spots = [exp(-\u0394E/(k_B T_no_spots))] / [exp(-\u0394E/(k_B T_spots))] \n\nBecause the g factors (statistical weights) are the same in both cases, they cancel out. So this simplifies to exp(\u0394E/(k_B) [1/T_spots - 1/T_no_spots])\n\nWait, actually, let me check that again. Let me write it step by step.\n\nLet me denote the ratio without spots as R_no = (g\u2082/g\u2081) exp(-\u0394E/(k_B T_no))\n\nWith spots, R_spots = (g\u2082/g\u2081) exp(-\u0394E/(k_B T_spots))\n\nTherefore, the ratio R_no / R_spots = exp( -\u0394E/(k_B T_no) + \u0394E/(k_B T_spots) ) = exp( \u0394E/(k_B) (1/T_spots - 1/T_no) )\n\nYes, that's correct. So the factor is exp( \u0394E/(k_B) (1/T_spots - 1/T_no) )\n\nNow, I need to compute this factor. To do that, I need to know \u0394E, the energy difference between the two levels. The problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 \u00c5. \n\nThe energy difference \u0394E is related to the wavelength of the transition by the equation:\n\n\u0394E = hc / \u03bb\n\nWhere h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nSo first, let's compute \u0394E. Let me note down the constants:\n\nh = 6.626 x 10^-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448 x 10^-10 m (since 1 \u00c5 = 1e-10 m)\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E = (6.626e-34 J\u00b7s)(3.0e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m:\n\n1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) x 10^(-25 +7) = approx 1.372 x 10^-18 J\n\nWait, let me compute that more precisely:\n\n1.9878 divided by 1.448:\n\n1.9878 / 1.448 \u2248 1.372 (since 1.448*1.372 \u2248 1.448*1.3 = 1.8824, plus 1.448*0.072\u22480.104, total \u22481.986, so yes, that's right)\n\nSo \u0394E \u2248 1.372 x 10^-18 J\n\nBut we need this in terms of eV perhaps? Wait, but Boltzmann's constant is in J/K, so maybe we can keep it in J.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so converting \u0394E to eV:\n\n\u0394E = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.57 eV\n\nHmm, that seems high for an atomic transition? Wait, 1448 \u00c5 is in the ultraviolet. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 1448 \u00c5 is 144.8 nm. The visible spectrum is 400-700 nm, so 144 nm is UV. The energy of a photon at 1448 \u00c5 (144.8 nm):\n\nE_photon = hc/\u03bb = (1240 eV\u00b7nm)/144.8 nm \u2248 8.57 eV. Yes, that's correct. So the energy difference between the two levels is about 8.57 eV.\n\nBut wait, the energy levels of Ti atoms... Hmm, but maybe that's okay. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, let's compute the exponent:\n\n\u0394E/(k_B) * (1/T_spots - 1/T_no)\n\nFirst, let's compute 1/T_spots - 1/T_no.\n\nT_no = 6000 K, T_spots = 5500 K.\n\n1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(5500*6000)\n\nCompute denominator: 5500*6000 = 33,000,000\n\nSo 500 / 33,000,000 \u2248 1.515e-5 K^-1\n\nSo the difference in reciprocal temperatures is ~1.515e-5 K^-1\n\nNow, \u0394E/(k_B) is (8.57eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) \u2248 let's see:\n\nWait, Boltzmann's constant k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K, but in eV/K it's 8.617e-5 eV/K.\n\nSo \u0394E is 8.57 eV, so \u0394E/(k_B) = 8.57 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's compute that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8.617e-5:\n\n\u2248 (8.57 / 8.617e-5) \u2248 (8.57 / 8.617) * 1e5 \u2248 approx (0.994) * 1e5 \u2248 99,400 K\n\nWait, that's a huge number. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 8.57 eV divided by 8.617e-5 eV/K gives:\n\n8.57 / 8.617e-5 = 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 8.57 / 0.000086 \u2248 100,000? Let me compute 8.617e-5 is 0.00008617, so 8.57 divided by that is 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 100,000? Let me compute 8.57 / 0.00008617:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1e5: 857000 / 8.617 \u2248 857000 / 8.617 \u2248 let's see:\n\n8.617 * 100,000 = 861,700, which is a bit more than 857,000. So approximately 99,500 K? Let's say approximately 100,000 K for estimation purposes.\n\nWait, but actually, let me do precise calculation:\n\n8.57 / 0.00008617 = ?\n\nLet me write 8.57 / 8.617e-5 = (8.57 / 8.617) * 1e5\n\n8.57 divided by 8.617 is approximately 0.994 (since 8.617 * 0.994 \u2248 8.617 - 8.617*0.006 \u2248 8.617 - 0.0517 \u2248 8.565, which is close to 8.57). So 0.994 * 1e5 \u2248 99,400 K.\n\nSo \u0394E/(k_B) \u2248 99,400 K.\n\nThen, the exponent is 99,400 K * (1.515e-5 K^-1) \u2248 99,400 * 1.515e-5\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 1e5 * 1.515e-5 = 1.515, so 99,400 is 0.994e5, so 0.994e5 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 0.994 * 1.515 \u2248 approx 1.506.\n\nWait, let me compute 99,400 * 1.515e-5:\n\n99,400 * 1.515e-5 = (99,400 * 1.515) * 1e-5\n\nCompute 99,400 * 1.515:\n\nFirst, 100,000 * 1.515 = 151,500\n\nSubtract 600 * 1.515 = 909, so 151,500 - 909 = 150,591\n\nTherefore, 150,591 * 1e-5 = 15.0591\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 99,400 * 1.515e-5:\n\nWait, 99,400 * 1.515e-5 = 99,400 * 0.00001515\n\nLet me compute 99,400 * 0.00001 = 0.994\n\nThen 99,400 * 0.00000515 = ?\n\n0.00000515 * 100,000 = 0.515, so 0.00000515 * 99,400 \u2248 0.515 * 0.994 \u2248 0.512\n\nTherefore total is approx 0.994 + 0.512 \u2248 1.506. Wait, but that contradicts the previous step. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent calculation.\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nThe exponent is (\u0394E/k_B)*(1/T_spots - 1/T_no) = (\u0394E/k_B)*(\u0394(1/T))\n\nWe had \u0394E/k_B \u2248 99,400 K\n\n\u0394(1/T) = 1/5500 - 1/6000 \u2248 1.515e-5 K^-1\n\nMultiply them: 99,400 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 99,400 * 0.00001515 \u2248\n\nLet me compute 99,400 * 0.00001 = 0.994\n\n99,400 * 0.00000515 = ?\n\n0.00000515 is 5.15e-6\n\nSo 99,400 * 5.15e-6 = (99,400 * 5.15) * 1e-6\n\n99,400 * 5 = 497,000\n\n99,400 * 0.15 = 14,910\n\nTotal: 497,000 +14,910 = 511,910\n\nMultiply by 1e-6: 0.51191\n\nSo total exponent is 0.994 + 0.51191 \u2248 1.5059\n\nSo approximately 1.506.\n\nTherefore, the exponent is about 1.506, so the factor is exp(1.506).\n\nCompute exp(1.506):\n\nWe know that exp(1) = 2.718, exp(1.6) \u2248 4.953, exp(1.5) \u2248 4.4817, exp(1.506) is a bit more than that.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nexp(1.5) = 4.4817\n\nexp(1.506) = exp(1.5 + 0.006) = exp(1.5)*exp(0.006) \u2248 4.4817 * (1 + 0.006 + 0.006\u00b2/2) \u2248 4.4817 * 1.006018 \u2248 4.4817 * 1.006 \u2248 4.4817 + 4.4817*0.006 \u2248 4.4817 + 0.0269 \u2248 4.5086\n\nSo approximately 4.51.\n\nTherefore, the factor is about 4.5, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check again the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the energy difference calculation:\n\n\u03bb = 1448 \u00c5 = 1448e-10 m\n\n\u0394E = hc/\u03bb = (6.626e-34 * 3e8)/(1448e-10)\n\nCompute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nDivide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.9878 / 1.448 * 1e-18 \u2248 1.372 * 1e-18 J\n\nConvert to eV: 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV \u2248 8.57 eV. That's correct.\n\nThen, \u0394E/(k_B) where k_B is 8.617e-5 eV/K:\n\n8.57 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 100,000 K (approx 99,400 K). Correct.\n\nThen, 1/T_spots - 1/T_no = (1/5500 - 1/6000) \u2248 1.515e-5 K^-1. Correct.\n\nMultiply those two terms: 99,400 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 1.506. Correct.\n\nExponentiate: e^1.506 \u2248 4.5. So the factor is ~4.5, which is option B.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. The question says \"the ratio decreases when the star has spots\". So the ratio N\u2082/N\u2081 is smaller when there are spots. Therefore, the ratio without spots is higher. So the factor is R_no / R_spots = exp(\u0394E/(k_B)(1/T_spots - 1/T_no)). Since T_spots < T_no, 1/T_spots > 1/T_no, so the exponent is positive, so the factor is greater than 1, which matches the options. So 4.5 is B, which is one of the options. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I inverted the temperature difference. Let me re-express the exponent:\n\nThe exponent is (\u0394E/k_B)(1/T_spots - 1/T_no). Since T_spots is lower (5500 K) than T_no (6000 K), 1/T_spots is higher, so the difference (1/T_spots - 1/T_no) is positive. Therefore, the exponent is positive, so exp(positive) is greater than 1, so R_no/R_spots is greater than 1, which is correct. So that's right.\n\nAlternatively, if I had done (1/T_no - 1/T_spots), that would be negative, but since the exponent is (1/T_spots - 1/T_no), it's positive. So all steps are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, ~4.5.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Let me recalculate the exponent:\n\n\u0394E/(k_B) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) \u2248 8.57 / 0.00008617 \u2248 100,000 K (approx 99,400 K)\n\nThen, 1/T_spots - 1/T_no = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) \u2248 1.515e-5 K^-1\n\nMultiply them: 99,400 * 1.515e-5 \u2248 99,400 * 0.00001515 \u2248\n\nLet me compute 99,400 * 0.00001 = 0.994\n\n99,400 * 0.00000515 = ?\n\n0.00000515 is 5.15e-6\n\nSo 99,400 * 5.15e-6 = (99,400 * 5.15) * 1e-6\n\n99,400 * 5 = 497,000\n\n99,400 * 0.15 = 14,910\n\nTotal: 497,000 + 14,910 = 511,910\n\nMultiply by 1e-6: 0.51191\n\nTotal exponent: 0.994 + 0.51191 \u2248 1.5059, so ~1.506. So exp(1.506) \u2248 4.5. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use more precise numbers?\n\nLet me compute \u0394E/(k_B) more precisely.\n\n\u0394E = hc/\u03bb\n\nh = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s (exact value as per SI)\n\nc = 299792458 m/s (exact)\n\n\u03bb = 1448e-10 m\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394E = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / (1448e-10)\n\nFirst compute numerator:\n\n6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 \u2248 6.62607015 * 2.99792458e8 * 1e-34\n\nWait, 6.62607015 * 2.99792458 \u2248 19.8645 (since 6.626 * 3 \u2248 19.878, so close)\n\nSo 19.8645e-26 J\u00b7m (since 1e-34 * 1e8 = 1e-26)\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = 6.62607015 * 299792458 * 1e-34\n\nCompute 6.62607015 * 299,792,458 \u2248 6.62607 * 3e8 \u2248 1.9878e9, but precise?\n\nWait, 6.62607015 * 299,792,458:\n\nLet me compute 6.62607015 * 3e8 = 1.987821045e9, but since it's 299,792,458 which is ~2.9979e8, so:\n\n6.62607015 * 2.99792458e8 = 6.62607015 * 2.99792458 * 1e8\n\nCompute 6.62607015 * 2.99792458:\n\nLet me compute 6 * 2.9979 \u2248 17.9874\n\n0.62607 * 2.9979 \u2248 approx 1.876\n\nTotal \u2248 17.9874 + 1.876 \u2248 19.8634\n\nSo total is 19.8634e8 * 1e-34 (since the original was 6.626e-34 * 2.997e8 m/s)\n\nWait, actually, the units:\n\nWait, the numerator is (J\u00b7s)(m/s) = J\u00b7m, so the units are correct for energy (J).\n\nSo the numerator is 19.8634e8 * 1e-34 J\u00b7m? Wait, no, let me track the exponents properly.\n\nWait, 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s * 299792458 m/s = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 m\u00b7J/s\u00b2? Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, J = kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so J\u00b7s has units kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s. Then multiplying by m/s gives kg\u00b7m\u00b3/s\u00b2. Hmm, perhaps better to just compute the numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the numerical value of hc in eV\u00b7\u00c5:\n\nWe know that hc = 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5 approximately. Let me confirm:\n\nhc = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nConvert to eV\u00b7\u00c5:\n\n1 J = 6.242e18 eV,\n\n1 m = 1e10 \u00c5,\n\nSo 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m = 1.9878e-25 * 6.242e18 eV * 1e10 \u00c5 = 1.9878 * 6.242 * 1e(-25 +18 +10) eV\u00b7\u00c5\n\nWait, exponents: -25 +18 +10 = 3, so 1e3.\n\nSo 1.9878 * 6.242 \u2248 12.4 (since 2*6.242=12.484, so close). Therefore, hc \u2248 12.4 eV\u00b7nm, or 1240 eV\u00b7\u00c5. Yes, that's the standard value.\n\nTherefore, hc = 1240 eV\u00b7\u00c5.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E (in eV) = hc / \u03bb (in \u00c5) = 1240 / 1448 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1240 divided by 1448:\n\n1448 / 1240 \u2248 1.1677, so 1/1.1677 \u2248 0.856. So 1240 /1448 \u2248 0.856, so \u0394E \u2248 0.856 eV? Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation of 8.57 eV. Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, this is a critical mistake.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I messed up the units here. Let me clarify:\n\nThe wavelength \u03bb is given as 1448 \u00c5. So in the formula \u0394E = hc/\u03bb, if hc is in eV\u00b7\u00c5, then \u03bb in \u00c5 gives \u0394E in eV.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E = 1240 eV\u00b7\u00c5 / 1448 \u00c5 \u2248 0.856 eV. Wait, so that's different from my previous calculation where I got 8.57 eV. That was a mistake in unit conversion earlier.\n\nOh no! I see the problem. Earlier, I converted \u03bb to meters, but when using hc in eV\u00b7\u00c5, it's much simpler. So my initial calculation was wrong because I messed up the units. Let me start over with the correct approach.\n\nSo, using hc = 1240 eV\u00b7nm, but since the wavelength is given in \u00c5, which is 0.1 nm, so 1448 \u00c5 = 144.8 nm.\n\nWait, 1 \u00c5 = 0.1 nm, so 1448 \u00c5 = 144.8 nm.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E = hc / \u03bb = (1240 eV\u00b7nm) / (144.8 nm) \u2248 1240 / 144.8 \u2248 8.56 eV. Wait, that's the same as before. Wait, but hold on, 1240 divided by 144.8 is indeed approximately 8.56 eV. Wait, but if hc is 1240 eV\u00b7nm, then dividing by nm gives eV. So 1240 / 144.8 \u2248 8.56 eV. So that's correct. So my first calculation was correct, but when I thought of hc in eV\u00b7\u00c5, I made a mistake. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, actually, hc is 1240 eV\u00b7nm, so 1240 eV\u00b7nm divided by 144.8 nm gives 8.56 eV. Alternatively, if expressed in \u00c5, since 1 nm = 10 \u00c5, then hc = 1240 eV\u00b7nm = 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5. Then, \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5, so \u0394E = 12400 / 1448 \u2248 8.56 eV. So that's correct. So my initial calculation was correct. The confusion was when I thought of hc in eV\u00b7\u00c5, but actually, it's 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E is indeed ~8.56 eV. So that part was correct.\n\nTherefore, the rest of the calculation is okay. So the exponent is ~1.506, leading to exp(1.506) \u2248 4.5. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check once again the exponent calculation with precise numbers.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E/(k_B):\n\n\u0394E = 8.56 eV\n\nk_B = 8.617e-5 eV/K\n\nSo \u0394E/k_B = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's compute this division precisely.\n\nLet me write 8.56 / 0.00008617:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8.617e-5:\n\nWait, alternatively, 8.56 / (8.617e-5) = (8.56 / 8.617) * 1e5\n\n8.56 /8.617 \u2248 0.9936\n\nTherefore, 0.9936 * 1e5 \u2248 99,360 K\n\nSo \u0394E/k_B \u2248 99,360 K\n\nThen, 1/T_spots -1/T_no = (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) \u2248 1.51515e-5 K^-1\n\nMultiply them:\n\n99,360 K * 1.51515e-5 K^-1 \u2248 99,360 * 1.51515e-5\n\nLet me compute 99,360 * 1.51515e-5:\n\nFirst, 1e5 * 1.51515e-5 = 0.151515\n\nSo 99,360 is 0.9936e5, so 0.9936e5 * 1.51515e-5 = 0.9936 * 1.51515 \u2248\n\nCompute 1 * 1.51515 = 1.51515\n\nSubtract 0.0064 * 1.51515 \u2248 0.009697\n\nSo approx 1.51515 - 0.009697 \u2248 1.50545\n\nTherefore, exponent \u22481.50545\n\nThus, exp(1.50545). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nWe know that ln(4.5) is approximately 1.5041, since ln(4) = 1.386, ln(5)=1.609, so ln(4.5)=?\n\nCompute ln(4.5):\n\nln(4) = 1.386294\n\nln(4.5) = ln(4) + ln(1.125) \u2248 1.386294 + 0.117783 \u2248 1.504077\n\nAh! So ln(4.5) \u22481.5041, which is very close to our exponent of ~1.50545. Therefore, exp(1.50545) \u2248 4.5 * exp(0.00137)\n\nSince 1.50545 -1.504077 \u22480.00137\n\nexp(0.00137) \u22481 +0.00137 + (0.00137)^2/2 \u22481.00137 + 0.00000094 \u22481.00137\n\nTherefore, exp(1.50545)\u22484.5 *1.00137\u22484.506\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 4.5, so the answer is B.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B, ~4.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does, we use the Boltzmann equation under LTE conditions.

So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I inverted the temperature difference. Let me re-express the exponent:\n\nThe exponent is (\u0394E/k_B)(1/T_spots - 1/T_no). Since T_spots is lower (5500 K) than T_no (6000 K), 1/T_spots is higher, so the difference (1/T_spots - 1/T_no) is positive. Therefore, the exponent is positive, so exp(positive) is greater than 1, so R_no/R_spots is greater than 1, which is correct. So that's right.\n\nAlternatively, if I had done (1/T_no - 1/T_spots), that would be negative, but since the exponent is (1/T_spots - 1/T_no), it's positive.

Wait, no, let me track the exponents properly.\n\nWait, 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s * 299792458 m/s = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 m\u00b7J/s\u00b2? Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, J = kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so J\u00b7s has units kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s. Then multiplying by m/s gives kg\u00b7m\u00b3/s\u00b2. Hmm, perhaps better to just compute the numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute the numerical value of hc in eV\u00b7\u00c5:\n\nWe know that hc = 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5 approximately. Let me confirm:\n\nhc = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\nConvert to eV\u00b7\u00c5:\n\n1 J = 6.242e18 eV,\n\n1 m = 1e10 \u00c5,\n\nSo 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m = 1.9878e-25 * 6.242e18 eV * 1e10 \u00c5 = 1.9878 * 6.242 * 1e(-25 +18 +10) eV\u00b7\u00c5\n\nWait, exponents: -25 +18 +10 = 3, so 1e3.\n\nSo 1.9878 * 6.242 \u2248 12.4 (since 2*6.242=12.484, so close). Therefore, hc \u2248 12.4 eV\u00b7nm, or 1240 eV\u00b7\u00c5. Yes, that's the standard value.\n\nTherefore, hc = 1240 eV\u00b7\u00c5.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E (in eV) = hc / \u03bb (in \u00c5) = 1240 / 1448 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n1240 divided by 1448:\n\n1448 / 1240 \u2248 1.1677, so 1/1.1677 \u2248 0.856. So 1240 /1448 \u2248 0.856, so \u0394E \u2248 0.856 eV? Wait, that contradicts my previous calculation of 8.57 eV. Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, this is a critical mistake.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I messed up the units here. Let me clarify:\n\nThe wavelength \u03bb is given as 1448 \u00c5. So in the formula \u0394E = hc/\u03bb, if hc is in eV\u00b7\u00c5, then \u03bb in \u00c5 gives \u0394E in eV.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E = 1240 eV\u00b7\u00c5 / 1448 \u00c5 \u2248 0.856 eV. Wait, so that's different from my previous calculation where I got 8.57 eV. That was a mistake in unit conversion earlier.\n\nOh no! I see the problem. Earlier, I converted \u03bb to meters, but when using hc in eV\u00b7\u00c5, it's much simpler. So my initial calculation was wrong because I messed up the units. Let me start over with the correct approach.\n\nSo, using hc = 1240 eV\u00b7nm, but since the wavelength is given in \u00c5, which is 0.1 nm, so 1448 \u00c5 = 144.8 nm.\n\nWait, 1 \u00c5 = 0.1 nm, so 1448 \u00c5 = 144.8 nm.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E = hc / \u03bb = (1240 eV\u00b7nm) / (144.8 nm) \u2248 1240 / 144.8 \u2248 8.56 eV. Wait, that's the same as before. Wait, but hold on, 1240 divided by 144.8 is indeed approximately 8.56 eV. Wait, but if hc is 1240 eV\u00b7nm, then dividing by nm gives eV. So 1240 / 144.8 \u2248 8.56 eV. So that's correct. So my first calculation was correct, but when I thought of hc in eV\u00b7\u00c5, I made a mistake. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, actually, hc is 1240 eV\u00b7nm, so 1240 eV\u00b7nm divided by 144.8 nm gives 8.56 eV. Alternatively, if expressed in \u00c5, since 1 nm = 10 \u00c5, then hc = 1240 eV\u00b7nm = 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5. Then, \u03bb = 1448 \u00c5, so \u0394E = 12400 / 1448 \u2248 8.56 eV. So that's correct. So my initial calculation was correct. The confusion was when I thought of hc in eV\u00b7\u00c5, but actually, it's 12400 eV\u00b7\u00c5. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, \u0394E is indeed ~8.56 eV. So that part was correct.\n\nTherefore, the rest of the calculation is okay. So the exponent is ~1.506, leading to exp(1.506) \u2248 4.5. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check once again the exponent calculation with precise numbers.\n\nLet me compute \u0394E/(k_B):\n\n\u0394E = 8.56 eV\n\nk_B = 8.617e-5 eV/K\n\nSo \u0394E/k_B = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 \u2248 8.56 / 0.00008617 \u2248 let's compute this division precisely.\n\nLet me write 8.56 / 0.00008617:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8.617e-5:\n\nWait, alternatively, 8.56 / (8.617e-5) = (8.56 / 8.617) * 1e5\n\n8.56 /8.617 \u2248 0.9936\n\nTherefore, 0.9936 * 1e5 \u2248 99,360 K\n\nSo \u0394E/k_B \u2248 99,360 K\n\nThen, 1/T_spots -1/T_no = (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) = 500/(33,000,000) \u2248 1.51515e-5 K^-1\n\nMultiply them:\n\n99,360 K * 1.51515e-5 K^-1 \u2248 99,360 * 1.51515e-5\n\nLet me compute 99,360 * 1.51515e-5:\n\nFirst, 1e5 * 1.51515e-5 = 0.151515\n\nSo 99,360 is 0.9936e5, so 0.9936e5 * 1.51515e-5 = 0.9936 * 1.51515 \u2248\n\nCompute 1 * 1.51515 = 1.51515\n\nSubtract 0.0064 * 1.51515 \u2248 0.009697\n\nSo approx 1.51515 - 0.009697 \u2248 1.50545\n\nTherefore, exponent \u22481.50545\n\nThus, exp(1.50545). Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nWe know that ln(4.5) is approximately 1.5041, since ln(4) = 1.386, ln(5)=1.609, so ln(4.5)=?\n\nCompute ln(4.5):\n\nln(4) = 1.386294\n\nln(4.5) = ln(4) + ln(1.125) \u2248 1.386294 + 0.117783 \u2248 1.504077\n\nAh! So ln(4.5) \u22481.5041, which is very close to our exponent of ~1.50545. Therefore, exp(1.50545) \u2248 4.5 * exp(0.00137)\n\nSince 1.50545 -1.504077 \u22480.00137\n\nexp(0.00137) \u22481 +0.00137 + (0.00137)^2/2 \u22481.00137 + 0.00000094 \u22481.00137\n\nTherefore, exp(1.50545)\u22484.5 *1.00137\u22484.506\n\nTherefore, the factor is approximately 4.5, so the answer is B.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B, ~4.5.\n\n",
