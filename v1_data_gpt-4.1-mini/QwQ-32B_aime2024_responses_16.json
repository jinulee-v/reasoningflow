        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain every rectangular box in the set \ud835\udc9e (they mentioned \ud835\udc9e but the problem says \ud835\udcaf? Wait, let me check again. Wait, the problem says \"Let \ud835\udcaf be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let r be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of \ud835\udcaf. The value of r\u00b2 can be written as p/q...\" Hmm, okay, so maybe it's a typo in my head, but the problem says \ud835\udcaf. Anyway, moving on.\n\nFirst, the problem is about rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain all such boxes, and then find r\u00b2 where r is the radius of that sphere. The answer needs to be in the form p/q with p and q coprime, then find p+q.\n\nAlright, so first, let me recall that for a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, and the volume is abc = 23. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, so the sphere must have a radius at least half of that. But since we need the sphere to contain all such boxes, the radius must be the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in \ud835\udcaf. Therefore, r is the maximum of (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2))/2 for all a, b, c such that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23. Therefore, r\u00b2 would be the maximum of (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/4 over those boxes, so we need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23. Then, once we find that maximum value, divide by 4 to get r\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to an optimization problem: maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23. Let me note that variables a, b, c are positive real numbers.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Since we have two constraints, maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers? Or perhaps express variables in terms of each other?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use some inequalities or substitutions. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me note that the surface area is 54, so ab + bc + ac = 27. Volume is 23, so abc = 23.\n\nWe need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac is known (27), if we can express a + b + c in terms of something else, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac) = (a + b + c)^2 - 54. So if we can maximize (a + b + c)^2, then we can get a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Let me set up the problem.\n\nLet me denote the function to maximize as f(a,b,c) = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nSubject to the constraints:\n\ng(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ac - 27 = 0,\n\nh(a,b,c) = abc - 23 = 0.\n\nSo we have two constraints, so we need to use two Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian would be:\n\nL = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - \u03bb(ab + bc + ac - 27) - \u03bc(abc - 23).\n\nThen, taking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202a = 2a - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc(bc) = 0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202b = 2b - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc(ac) = 0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202c = 2c - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc(ab) = 0,\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\nab + bc + ac = 27,\n\nabc = 23.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find symmetry here. Suppose that the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Let me see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose that a = b. Then, let me set a = b, so we can write variables in terms of a and c.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me assume a = b. Then, let's see:\n\nLet a = b, so then:\n\nSurface area: 2(a\u00b2 + 2ac) = 54 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + 2ac = 27,\n\nVolume: a\u00b2c = 23,\n\nWe need to maximize a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 2a\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nSo let me write equations:\n\nFrom surface area: a\u00b2 + 2ac = 27,\n\nFrom volume: a\u00b2c = 23,\n\nWe can try to express c in terms of a from the volume equation: c = 23/(a\u00b2). Then plug into the surface area equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) = 27 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + 46/a = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na\u00b3 + 46 = 27a \u21d2 a\u00b3 -27a +46 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if it factors. Let me try a=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. 8-54 is -46, -46 +46=0. So a=2 is a root. Therefore, factor as (a - 2)(a\u00b2 + 2a -23) =0.\n\nCheck: (a -2)(a\u00b2 + 2a -23) = a\u00b3 +2a\u00b2 -23a -2a\u00b2 -4a +46 = a\u00b3 -27a +46. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the roots are a=2 and roots of a\u00b2 +2a -23=0. The other roots would be [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since a must be positive, the other positive root is -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898. So possible a values are 2 and approximately 3.898.\n\nSo when a = 2, then c =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75.\n\nThen, compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 2*(2)^2 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625.\n\nAlternatively, when a \u22483.898, then c =23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, a\u00b2 \u2248 (3.898)^2 \u2248 15.19, so c\u224823/15.19\u22481.515.\n\nThen, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 \u2248 2*(15.19) + (1.515)^2 \u224830.38 + 2.295\u224832.675, which is less than 41.0625. So the maximum in this case is when a=2, giving 41.0625. Hmm, so that's one possibility.\n\nBut wait, this is under the assumption that a = b. Maybe the maximum occurs when all three variables are equal? Let me check that.\n\nIf a = b = c, then surface area would be 6a\u00b2 =54 \u21d2 a\u00b2=9 \u21d2 a=3. Volume would be a\u00b3=27, but the volume here is 23, which is less than 27, so that's not possible. So the cube is not in the set \ud835\udcaf. So the variables can't all be equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two variables are equal, but not a = b? Wait, but I assumed a = b, but maybe another pair? But since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, the maximum when two variables are equal would be the same regardless of which pair we choose. So perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, so the case we considered is sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum occurs when all variables are different? To check that, maybe we need to consider the Lagrangian equations.\n\nLooking back at the Lagrangian equations:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202a = 2a - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc(bc) = 0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202b = 2b - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc(ac) = 0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202c = 2c - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc(ab) = 0.\n\nIf we suppose that a = b = c, then we can check if that's a solution. But as before, that would require 6a\u00b2 =54 \u21d2 a=3, but volume would be 27\u226023, so that's not possible. So variables can't all be equal.\n\nAlternatively, suppose two variables are equal, say a = b \u2260 c. Then, let's see if the equations hold.\n\nLet me set a = b, so then variables are a, a, c.\n\nThen, the partial derivatives:\n\nFor \u2202L/\u2202a: 2a - \u03bb( a + c ) - \u03bc(ac) =0,\n\nSimilarly, \u2202L/\u2202b is the same as \u2202L/\u2202a,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202c: 2c - \u03bb(2a) - \u03bc(a\u00b2) =0.\n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1) 2a - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc(ac) =0,\n\n2) 2c - 2\u03bb a - \u03bc a\u00b2 =0,\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\nab + bc + ac = a\u00b2 + 2ac =27,\n\nabc = a\u00b2 c =23.\n\nSo let me see if we can solve these equations with a=2, c=23/4 as before.\n\nLet me plug in a=2, c=23/4.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb and \u03bc.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n2*(2) - \u03bb(2 + 23/4) - \u03bc*(2*(23/4)) =0,\n\nSo 4 - \u03bb*( (8/4 +23/4) ) - \u03bc*(23/2) =0,\n\n4 - \u03bb*(31/4) - \u03bc*(23/2)=0,\n\nEquation 2:\n\n2*(23/4) - 2\u03bb*(2) - \u03bc*(2\u00b2)=0,\n\n(23/2) -4\u03bb -4\u03bc =0,\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1) 4 - (31/4)\u03bb - (23/2)\u03bc =0,\n\n2) 23/2 -4\u03bb -4\u03bc =0.\n\nLet me write equation 2 as:\n\n4\u03bb +4\u03bc =23/2 \u21d2 \u03bb + \u03bc =23/8.\n\nLet me denote equation 2 as equation A: \u03bb + \u03bc =23/8.\n\nEquation 1: Let me multiply equation 1 by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n4*4 -31\u03bb - 46\u03bc =0 \u21d216 -31\u03bb -46\u03bc =0 \u21d231\u03bb +46\u03bc =16.\n\nNow, from equation A: \u03bb =23/8 - \u03bc.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n31*(23/8 - \u03bc) +46\u03bc =16,\n\nCompute 31*(23/8) -31\u03bc +46\u03bc =16,\n\n31*(23/8) +15\u03bc =16,\n\nCalculate 31*23: 30*23=690, 1*23=23 \u21d2 total 713,\n\nSo 713/8 +15\u03bc =16,\n\n15\u03bc =16 -713/8 = (128/8 -713/8)= (-585)/8,\n\nThus \u03bc = (-585)/(8*15)= (-585)/120 = -39/8.\n\nThen, from equation A: \u03bb =23/8 - (-39/8)= (23 +39)/8=62/8=31/4.\n\nSo \u03bb=31/4, \u03bc= -39/8.\n\nNow, check if these satisfy equation 1:\n\n31\u03bb +46\u03bc =31*(31/4) +46*(-39/8).\n\nCompute 31*31=961, so 961/4,\n\n46*39= 46*(40-1)=1840-46=1794, so 46*(-39/8)= -1794/8,\n\nThus total: 961/4 -1794/8 = (1922 -1794)/8 =128/8=16, which matches equation 1. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the solution a=2, c=23/4 is indeed a critical point. So that's valid.\n\nBut is this a maximum? Well, when we considered the other root of the cubic, which was a\u22483.898, that gave a lower value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, so perhaps this is the maximum. But we need to check if there are other critical points where variables are not equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another critical point where all variables are different. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are all different. Then, the three partial derivatives must hold:\n\n2a - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\n2b - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0,\n\n2c - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0.\n\nThis system seems complicated. Maybe we can subtract equations to find relations between variables.\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n[2b - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac] - [2a - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc] =0,\n\nSo 2(b -a) - \u03bb(a + c - b - c) - \u03bc(ac - bc)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(b -a) - \u03bb(a - b) - \u03bc c(a - b)=0,\n\nFactor out (b -a):\n\n(b -a)[2 + \u03bb + \u03bc c] =0.\n\nSince a \u2260 b (assuming all variables are different), then:\n\n2 + \u03bb + \u03bc c =0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract the second equation from the third:\n\n[2c - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab] - [2b - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac] =0,\n\n2(c - b) - \u03bb(a + b - a - c) - \u03bc(ab - ac)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(c - b) - \u03bb(b - c) - \u03bc a(b - c)=0,\n\nFactor out (c - b):\n\n(c - b)[2 + \u03bb + \u03bc a] =0.\n\nAgain, since c \u2260 b, then:\n\n2 + \u03bb + \u03bc a =0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract first equation from third:\n\n[2c - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab] - [2a - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc] =0,\n\n2(c -a) - \u03bb(a + b - b - c) - \u03bc(ab - bc)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(c -a) - \u03bb(a - c) - \u03bc b(a - c)=0,\n\nFactor out (c -a):\n\n(c -a)[2 + \u03bb + \u03bc b] =0.\n\nSince c \u2260a, then:\n\n2 + \u03bb + \u03bc b =0.\n\nTherefore, from the above three results:\n\n2 + \u03bb + \u03bc c =0,\n\n2 + \u03bb + \u03bc a =0,\n\n2 + \u03bb + \u03bc b =0.\n\nTherefore, setting the first two equal:\n\n2 + \u03bb + \u03bc c = 2 + \u03bb + \u03bc a \u21d2 \u03bc(c -a)=0.\n\nSince \u03bc \u22600 (unless... let's see, if \u03bc=0, then from the first equation 2 + \u03bb =0, but then from the other equations, same, but let's see. If \u03bc=0, then from the first equation 2a - \u03bb(b + c)=0, similarly for others. But if \u03bc=0, then from the first three equations, we have 2a = \u03bb(b + c), 2b=\u03bb(a + c), 2c=\u03bb(a + b). Maybe possible? Let me check later. But assuming \u03bc\u22600, then from \u03bc(c -a)=0, since \u03bc\u22600, then c =a. But we assumed all variables are different, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the only possibility is that variables cannot all be different. Therefore, the critical points must have at least two variables equal. Therefore, the maximum must occur when two variables are equal, so the case we considered earlier is the only possibility. Therefore, the maximum of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is 41.0625 when a = b =2 and c=23/4.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that this is indeed a maximum. Since when variables are unequal, like in the other solution of the cubic, the value was lower, so perhaps this is the maximum. But to be thorough, maybe there are other cases where different pairs are equal?\n\nSuppose instead of a = b, we set a = c, then similar steps would follow, but due to symmetry, the result would be the same. Similarly for b = c. So the maximum is indeed 41.0625, which is 41 + 0.0625 = 41 + 1/16, but actually 41.0625 is 657/16. Let me check:\n\n41.0625 *16 = 41*16 + 0.0625*16 = 656 +1=657. So yes, 657/16. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 657/16, so r\u00b2 would be (657/16)/4 = 657/64. Wait, but hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait, the radius is half the space diagonal, so the space diagonal is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), so radius is (1/2)sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2), so r\u00b2 would be (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)/4. Therefore, if a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is 657/16, then r\u00b2 is (657/16)/4 = 657/64. Let me check 657 and 64. Are they coprime?\n\n657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657 = 3*219 = 3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. So no common factors. Therefore, 657/64 is reduced, so p=657, q=64, so p+q=721. But before I get too excited, let me confirm that this is indeed the maximum.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if there are other critical points when variables are not two equal. Wait, according to the Lagrangian analysis, the only critical points are when two variables are equal. So the maximum must be at that point. But let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at some other point where variables are not equal? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parametrize variables in terms of two variables. Let me suppose variables a, b, c with ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23. Let me set variables as follows: Let me set x = a, y = b, then c =23/(xy). Then, substitute into the surface area equation:\n\nab + bc + ac = xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = xy + 23/x +23/y =27.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nxy + 23/x +23/y =27.\n\nThis is a equation in two variables x and y. To find the maximum of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (23/(xy))\u00b2.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can set x = y to see if that gives the maximum. Wait, but that's the case when a = b, which we already considered. So that gives the same result. Alternatively, perhaps set x different from y?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t = x + y and s = xy, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use AM-QM inequality or other inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, note that for fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the expression a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is maximized when variables are as unequal as possible? Wait, but in our case, when variables are more equal, the sum of squares is smaller, so actually, to maximize the sum of squares, we need to make variables as unequal as possible. Wait, but in our case, when a and b are 2 and c is 5.75, that's quite unequal, and gives a higher sum of squares than when variables are closer. Wait, but in the other solution where a\u22483.898, c\u22481.515, which is even more unequal, but the sum of squares was lower. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, let me recalculate that. Let me take the other root of the cubic equation when a \u22483.898. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nThe cubic equation was a\u00b3 -27a +46 =0. We found that a=2 is a root, so factored into (a-2)(a\u00b2 +2a -23)=0. The other roots are from a\u00b2 +2a -23=0, so a = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). The positive root is -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let me compute 2*sqrt(6): sqrt(6)\u22482.449, so 2*2.449\u22484.898, so -1 +4.898\u22483.898, as before.\n\nSo a\u22483.898, then c=23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a\u00b2:\n\na\u22483.898, so a\u00b2\u2248(3.898)^2\u224815.19, so c\u224823/15.19\u22481.515.\n\nThen, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2\u2248 (15.19) + (15.19) + (1.515)^2\u224830.38 + 2.3\u224832.68, which is indeed less than 41.06. Hmm, so even though c is smaller, the sum of squares is smaller. So that suggests that making one variable very large and another very small doesn't help. Wait, but in this case, a is about 3.9, which is larger than 2, but c is smaller. Hmm, so perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2, c=5.75.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another critical point where variables are arranged differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable approaches zero? Let me see. Suppose that c approaches zero, then the volume abc=23 would require that a or b approaches infinity, but surface area 2(ab + bc + ac)=54. If c approaches zero, then ab must approach 27/2=13.5, but then volume abc approaches zero, which contradicts the volume being 23. So that's impossible. Similarly, variables can't be too small or too large.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum occurs at the case when two variables are equal, which we found, so that is indeed the maximum. Therefore, the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is 657/16, so r\u00b2 is 657/64, so the answer is 657 +64=721.\n\nBut wait, before I conclude, let me check if there are other possibilities where variables are not two equal but give a higher sum.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that a, b, c are such that one variable is larger than 2, and others are different. Let me try some numbers.\n\nSuppose a=3, then let me see what b and c would be.\n\nIf a=3, then from volume: 3bc=23 \u21d2 bc=23/3\u22487.6667.\n\nFrom surface area: ab + bc + ac =3b +3c + bc=27.\n\nSo 3b +3c + (23/3)=27 \u21d23(b +c)=27 -23/3= (81 -23)/3=58/3 \u21d2b +c=58/9\u22486.4444.\n\nSo we have b +c\u22486.4444 and bc\u22487.6667.\n\nLet me set variables b and c such that they satisfy these. Let me denote variables as x and y, so x + y =58/9, xy=23/3.\n\nThen, the quadratic equation is t\u00b2 - (58/9)t +23/3=0.\n\nMultiply by 9: 9t\u00b2 -58t +69=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 58\u00b2 -4*9*69=3364 - 2484= 880.\n\nsqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4*sqrt(55)\u22484*7.416\u224829.664.\n\nThus roots: [58 \u00b129.664]/18.\n\nSo first root: (58 +29.664)/18\u224887.664/18\u22484.87, second root\u2248(58-29.664)/18\u224828.336/18\u22481.574.\n\nThus, b\u22484.87, c\u22481.574 or vice versa.\n\nThen, compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=9 + (4.87)^2 + (1.574)^2\u22489 +23.7 +2.475\u224835.175, which is still less than 41.06.\n\nHmm, so even with a=3, the sum is lower. Let me try a=1. Let me see.\n\nIf a=1, then bc=23, and surface area: ab + bc +ac =b +c +23=27 \u21d2b +c=4.\n\nSo with bc=23 and b +c=4. Then quadratic equation t\u00b2 -4t +23=0. Discriminant 16 -92= -76 <0. No real solutions. So that's impossible.\n\nHow about a=4? Let me try a=4.\n\nThen bc=23/4\u22485.75,\n\nSurface area:4b +4c + bc=27 \u21d24(b +c) +5.75=27 \u21d24(b +c)=21.25 \u21d2b +c=5.3125.\n\nThus, variables b and c satisfy b +c=5.3125 and bc\u22485.75.\n\nQuadratic equation: t\u00b2 -5.3125 t +5.75=0.\n\nDiscriminant: (5.3125)^2 -4*5.75\u224828.22 -23\u22485.22. sqrt(5.22)\u22482.285.\n\nRoots: [5.3125 \u00b12.285]/2.\n\nFirst root\u2248(5.3125 +2.285)/2\u22487.5975/2\u22483.798,\n\nSecond root\u2248(5.3125 -2.285)/2\u22483.0275/2\u22481.513.\n\nThus, a=4, b\u22483.8, c\u22481.513,\n\nSum of squares: 16 + (3.8)^2 + (1.513)^2\u224816 +14.44 +2.29\u224832.73, which is lower than 41.06.\n\nHmm, so seems like the maximum is indeed when a=b=2, c=23/4=5.75.\n\nWait, let me check another case where a=1. Let me see, but earlier when a=1, no solution. How about a=2.5?\n\nLet me try a=2.5. Then bc=23/(2.5)^2=23/6.25\u22483.68.\n\nSurface area:2.5b +2.5c + bc=27,\n\nSo 2.5(b +c) +3.68=27 \u21d22.5(b +c)=23.32 \u21d2b +c\u22489.328.\n\nThus, variables b and c with b +c\u22489.328 and bc\u22483.68.\n\nQuadratic equation: t\u00b2 -9.328 t +3.68\u22480.\n\nDiscriminant\u2248(9.328)^2 -4*3.68\u224887 -14.72\u224872.28,\n\nsqrt(72.28)\u22488.5,\n\nRoots\u2248[9.328 \u00b18.5]/2,\n\nFirst root\u2248(17.828)/2\u22488.914,\n\nSecond root\u2248(0.828)/2\u22480.414.\n\nThus, a=2.5, b\u22488.914, c\u22480.414,\n\nSum of squares: (2.5)^2 + (8.914)^2 + (0.414)^2\u22486.25 +79.46 +0.17\u224885.88? Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, wait, 8.914 squared is about 79.46, plus 0.414 squared is ~0.17, plus 6.25 gives ~85.88? But that contradicts previous results. Wait, but hold on, if a=2.5, b\u22488.914, c\u22480.414, then the surface area would be 2(ab + bc + ac)=2*(2.5*8.914 +8.914*0.414 +2.5*0.414).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2.5*8.914\u224822.285,\n\n8.914*0.414\u22483.696,\n\n2.5*0.414\u22481.035,\n\nTotal sum inside:22.285 +3.696 +1.035\u224827.016, which is close to 27, so that works. Volume is 2.5*8.914*0.414\u22482.5*3.696\u22489.24, but wait, that's not 23. Wait, hold on, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, bc was supposed to be 23/(a\u00b2)=23/(6.25)=3.68, so volume is a*b*c =2.5*(b*c)=2.5*3.68\u22489.2, which is not 23. Wait, so that's a problem. Wait, so my mistake here is that when I set a=2.5, then bc=23/(a\u00b2)=23/(6.25)=3.68, so volume is a*b*c= a*(b*c)=2.5*3.68\u22489.2, which is not 23. Wait, so that's a contradiction. Wait, so I must have messed up the equations.\n\nWait, hold on, if a=2.5, then volume is a*b*c=23, so bc=23/(2.5)=9.2, not 23/(a\u00b2). Wait, no, wait, volume is a*b*c=23, so bc=23/a. Wait, yes, that's right. Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier.\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nIf a is given, then bc = 23/a, not 23/a\u00b2. Wait, yes, because volume is a*b*c=23 \u21d2 bc=23/a. So my mistake earlier was in the calculation when I set a=2.5, bc should be 23/2.5=9.2, not 23/(2.5)^2. That was an error. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo, if a=2.5, then bc=23/2.5=9.2,\n\nSurface area: ab + bc + ac =2.5b +2.5c +9.2=27 \u21d22.5(b +c)=27 -9.2=17.8 \u21d2b +c=17.8/2.5=7.12,\n\nThus, variables b and c satisfy b +c=7.12 and bc=9.2,\n\nThus quadratic equation: t\u00b2 -7.12 t +9.2=0,\n\nDiscriminant: (7.12)^2 -4*9.2\u224850.69 -36.8\u224813.89,\n\nsqrt(13.89)\u22483.727,\n\nRoots: [7.12 \u00b13.727]/2,\n\nFirst root\u2248(10.847)/2\u22485.423,\n\nSecond root\u2248(3.393)/2\u22481.6965.\n\nThus, a=2.5, b\u22485.423, c\u22481.6965,\n\nThen, compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22486.25 +29.4 +2.88\u224838.53, which is still less than 41.06.\n\nSo that's better than the previous wrong calculation but still less than 41.06.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the case when a=b=2 gives the highest sum so far. Let me check another case where a=1. Let me see, but as before, when a=1, bc=23, and surface area would be ab + bc +ac =b +c +23=27 \u21d2b +c=4. But bc=23 and b +c=4, which as before, discriminant negative, so no solution. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, let me try a= sqrt(23/c). Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of symmetric sums. Let me denote S = a + b + c, P = ab + bc + ac =27, R = abc=23.\n\nWe need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2P = S\u00b2 -54. So to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, we need to maximize S\u00b2, so maximize S.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to maximizing a + b + c given that ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again for maximizing S =a + b + c with constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using inequalities. Let me think.\n\nWe can consider that for positive real numbers a, b, c with fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the sum a + b + c is maximized when two variables are equal? Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, using the method of symmetric means. Let me recall that for three variables, with fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the sum a + b + c can be expressed in terms of the roots of the cubic equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Px - R =0, where S is the sum, P=27, R=23.\n\nThe roots are a, b, c. To maximize S, perhaps the roots need to be as spread out as possible? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the AM \u2265 GM inequality. But since we have fixed P and R, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that if two variables are equal, then we can parametrize as before, and see if that gives the maximum S.\n\nIn the case when a = b =2, c=23/4=5.75,\n\nThen S =2 +2 +5.75=9.75,\n\nAlternatively, when a\u22483.898, c\u22481.515, then S\u22483.898 +3.898 +1.515\u22489.311,\n\nWhich is less than 9.75.\n\nIn the case when a=2.5, b\u22485.423, c\u22481.6965, S\u22482.5 +5.423 +1.6965\u22489.6195, which is less than 9.75.\n\nSo the maximum S so far is 9.75, which gives a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (9.75)^2 -54\u224895.06 -54\u224841.06, which matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, this seems to be the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's a case where S is higher.\n\nSuppose a=1. Let me see, but as before, no solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me try a=1.5.\n\nThen bc=23/1.5\u224815.333,\n\nSurface area:1.5b +1.5c +15.333=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=11.6667 \u21d2b +c\u22487.7778,\n\nThus, variables b and c with b +c\u22487.7778 and bc\u224815.333,\n\nQuadratic equation: t\u00b2 -7.7778 t +15.333\u22480,\n\nDiscriminant\u2248(7.7778)^2 -4*15.333\u224860.5 -61.332\u2248-0.832,\n\nNegative discriminant, so no real solution. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm, so seems like the maximum S is indeed 9.75 when a=b=2, c=5.75.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is (9.75)^2 -54.\n\nLet me compute that exactly.\n\nFirst, 9.75 is 39/4, so (39/4)^2 = (39)^2 /16 = 1521/16,\n\nThus, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1521/16 -54 =1521/16 - 864/16 = (1521 -864)/16 =657/16,\n\nTherefore, r\u00b2 is (657/16)/4 =657/64,\n\nWhich reduces to 657/64, as 657 and 64 share no common factors (since 657 is 3\u00d7219=3\u00d73\u00d773, and 64 is 2^6). So yes, coprime.\n\nTherefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nWait, but before I finish, let me check once more if there could be another case where variables are not two equal but give a higher S.\n\nSuppose that variables are a, b, c with a different from b and c, but arranged such that S is higher.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that one variable is larger than 2, but not equal to another.\n\nWait, let me try a=2. Let me see, if a=2, then as before, b=2, c=23/4. Alternatively, if a=2 but b\u2260c, would that give a higher S?\n\nWait, if a=2, then from the volume, bc=23/2=11.5,\n\nSurface area:2b +2c + bc=27,\n\nSo 2(b +c) +11.5=27 \u21d22(b +c)=15.5 \u21d2b +c=7.75,\n\nThus, with bc=11.5 and b +c=7.75,\n\nQuadratic equation: t\u00b2 -7.75 t +11.5=0,\n\nDiscriminant: (7.75)^2 -46\u224860.06 -46\u224814.06,\n\nsqrt(14.06)\u22483.75,\n\nRoots: [7.75 \u00b13.75]/2,\n\nFirst root\u2248(11.5)/2=5.75,\n\nSecond root\u2248(4)/2=2,\n\nThus, the solutions are b=5.75, c=2 or vice versa. So actually, this is the same as the case when a=b=2, c=5.75. So even if we set a=2 and let b and c vary, the maximum S occurs when b=c=2 or one is 5.75 and the other 2. Wait, but in this case, when a=2, and b and c are 5.75 and 2, then the sum S is 2 +5.75 +2=9.75, same as before. So indeed, the maximum occurs when two variables are 2 and the third is 5.75. So that is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, I think this is correct. So the answer is 657 +64=721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n</think>\n\nGiven the set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \\(r\\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius \\(r\\) is half the space diagonal of the box, so we need to maximize the space diagonal \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\\) for boxes with \\(2(ab + bc + ac) = 54\\) and \\(abc = 23\\).\n\nFirst, we note that the surface area constraint gives \\(ab + bc + ac = 27\\). We aim to maximize \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\). Using the identity \\((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)\\), we can express \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\) as \\((a + b + c)^2 - 54\\). Thus, maximizing \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\) is equivalent to maximizing \\((a + b + c)^2\\).\n\nWe consider the case where two variables are equal. Let \\(a = b\\). Then, the constraints become:\n\\[\na^2 + 2ac = 27 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a^2c = 23.\n\\]\nSolving for \\(c\\) from the volume equation, we get \\(c = \\frac{23}{a^2}\\). Substituting into the surface area equation:\n\\[\na^2 + 2a \\left(\\frac{23}{a^2}\\right) = 27 \\implies a^2 + \\frac{46}{a} = 27.\n\\]\nMultiplying through by \\(a\\) gives the cubic equation:\n\\[\na^3 - 27a + 46 = 0.\n\\]\nFactoring, we find \\(a = 2\\) is a root, leading to the factorization \\((a - 2)(a^2 + 2a - 23) = 0\\). The positive root of the quadratic factor is \\(a = -1 + 2\\sqrt{6}\\), but this gives a smaller value for \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\).\n\nFor \\(a = 2\\), we get \\(c = \\frac{23}{4} = 5.75\\). Thus, the sides are \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = 5.75\\). Calculating the sum of squares:\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \\left(\\frac{23}{4}\\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \\frac{529}{16} = \\frac{64 + 64 + 529}{16} = \\frac{657}{16}.\n\\]\nThe radius \\(r\\) is half the space diagonal, so:\n\\[\nr^2 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} = \\frac{657}{64}.\n\\]\nThus, \\(p = 657\\) and \\(q = 64\\), giving \\(p + q = 721\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{721}\n\\]"

            "text": "But let me see if there are other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at some other point where variables are not equal? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parametrize variables in terms of two variables. Let me suppose variables a, b, c with ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23. Let me set variables as follows: Let me set x = a, y = b, then c =23/(xy). Then, substitute into the surface area equation:\n\nab + bc + ac = xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = xy + 23/x +23/y =27.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nxy + 23/x +23/y =27.\n\nThis is a equation in two variables x and y. To find the maximum of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (23/(xy))\u00b2.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can set x = y to see if that gives the maximum. Wait, but that's the case when a = b, which we already considered. So that gives the same result. Alternatively, perhaps set x different from y?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t = x + y and s = xy, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use AM-QM inequality or other inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, note that for fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the expression a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is maximized when variables are as unequal as possible? Wait, but in our case, when variables are more equal, the sum of squares is smaller, so actually, to maximize the sum of squares, we need to make variables as unequal as possible. Wait, but in our case, when a and b are 2 and c is 5.75, that's quite unequal, and gives a higher sum of squares than when variables are closer. Wait, but in the other solution where a\u22483.898, c\u22481.515, which is even more unequal, but the sum of squares was lower. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, let me recalculate that. Let me take the other root of the cubic equation when a \u22483.898. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nThe cubic equation was a\u00b3 -27a +46 =0. We found that a=2 is a root, so factored into (a-2)(a\u00b2 +2a -23)=0. The other roots are from a\u00b2 +2a -23=0, so a = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). The positive root is -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let me compute 2*sqrt(6): sqrt(6)\u22482.449, so 2*2.449\u22484.898, so -1 +4.898\u22483.898, as before.\n\nSo a\u22483.898, then c=23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a\u00b2:\n\na\u22483.898, so a\u00b2\u2248(3.898)^2\u224815.19, so c\u224823/15.19\u22481.515.\n\nThen, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2\u2248 (15.19) + (15.19) + (1.515)^2\u224830.38 + 2.3\u224832.68, which is indeed less than 41.06. Hmm, so even though c is smaller, the sum of squares is smaller. So that suggests that making one variable very large and another very small doesn't help. Wait, but in this case, a is about 3.9, which is larger than 2, but c is smaller. Hmm, so perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2, c=5.75.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another critical point where variables are arranged differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable approaches zero? Let me see. Suppose that c approaches zero, then the volume abc=23 would require that a or b approaches infinity, but surface area 2(ab + bc + ac)=54. If c approaches zero, then ab must approach 27/2=13.5, but then volume abc approaches zero, which contradicts the volume being 23. So that's impossible. Similarly, variables can't be too small or too large.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum occurs at the case when two variables are equal, which we found, so that is indeed the maximum. Therefore, the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is 657/16, so r\u00b2 is 657/64, so the answer is 657 +64=721.\n\nBut wait, before I conclude, let me check if there are other possibilities where variables are not two equal but give a higher sum.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that a, b, c are such that one variable is larger than 2, and others are different. Let me try some numbers.\n\nSuppose a=3, then let me see what b and c would be.\n\nIf a=3, then from volume: 3bc=23 \u21d2 bc=23/3\u22487.6667.\n\nFrom surface area: ab + bc + ac =3b +3c + bc=27.\n\nSo 3b +3c + (23/3)=27 \u21d23(b +c)=27 -23/3= (81 -23)/3=58/3 \u21d2b +c=58/9\u22486.4444.\n\nSo we have b +c\u22486.4444 and bc\u22487.6667.\n\nLet me set variables b and c such that they satisfy these. Let me denote variables as x and y, so x + y =58/9, xy=23/3.\n\nThen, the quadratic equation is t\u00b2 - (58/9)t +23/3=0.\n\nMultiply by 9: 9t\u00b2 -58t +69=0.\n\nDiscriminant: 58\u00b2 -4*9*69=3364 - 2484= 880.\n\nsqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4*sqrt(55)\u22484*7.416\u224829.664.\n\nThus roots: [58 \u00b129.664]/18.\n\nSo first root: (58 +29.664)/18\u224887.664/18\u22484.87, second root\u2248(58-29.664)/18\u224828.336/18\u22481.574.\n\nThus, b\u22484.87, c\u22481.574 or vice versa.\n\nThen, compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=9 + (4.87)^2 + (1.574)^2\u22489 +23.7 +2.475\u224835.175, which is still less than 41.06.\n\nHmm, so even with a=3, the sum is lower. Let me try a=1. Let me see.\n\nIf a=1, then bc=23, and surface area: ab + bc +ac =b +c +23=27 \u21d2b +c=4.\n\nSo with bc=23 and b +c=4. Then quadratic equation t\u00b2 -4t +23=0. Discriminant 16 -92= -76 <0. No real solutions. So that's impossible.\n\nHow about a=4? Let me try a=4.\n\nThen bc=23/4\u22485.75,\n\nSurface area:4b +4c + bc=27 \u21d24(b +c) +5.75=27 \u21d24(b +c)=21.25 \u21d2b +c=5.3125.\n\nThus, variables b and c satisfy b +c=5.3125 and bc\u22485.75.\n\nQuadratic equation: t\u00b2 -5.3125 t +5.75=0.\n\nDiscriminant: (5.3125)^2 -4*5.75\u224828.22 -23\u22485.22. sqrt(5.22)\u22482.285.\n\nRoots: [5.3125 \u00b12.285]/2.\n\nFirst root\u2248(5.3125 +2.285)/2\u22487.5975/2\u22483.798,\n\nSecond root\u2248(5.3125 -2.285)/2\u22483.0275/2\u22481.513.\n\nThus, a=4, b\u22483.8, c\u22481.513,\n\nSum of squares: 16 + (3.8)^2 + (1.513)^2\u224816 +14.44 +2.29\u224832.73, which is lower than 41.06.\n\nHmm, so seems like the maximum is indeed when a=b=2, c=23/4=5.75.\n\nWait, let me check another case where a=1. Let me see, but earlier when a=1, no solution. How about a=2.5?\n\nLet me try a=2.5. Then bc=23/(2.5)^2=23/6.25\u22483.68.\n\nSurface area:2.5b +2.5c + bc=27,\n\nSo 2.5(b +c) +3.68=27 \u21d22.5(b +c)=23.32 \u21d2b +c\u22489.328.\n\nThus, variables b and c with b +c\u22489.328 and bc\u22483.68.\n\nQuadratic equation: t\u00b2 -9.328 t +3.68\u22480.\n\nDiscriminant\u2248(9.328)^2 -4*3.68\u224887 -14.72\u224872.28,\n\nsqrt(72.28)\u22488.5,\n\nRoots\u2248[9.328 \u00b18.5]/2,\n\nFirst root\u2248(17.828)/2\u22488.914,\n\nSecond root\u2248(0.828)/2\u22480.414.\n\nThus, a=2.5, b\u22488.914, c\u22480.414,\n\nSum of squares: (2.5)^2 + (8.914)^2 + (0.414)^2\u22486.25 +79.46 +0.17\u224885.88? Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, wait, 8.914 squared is about 79.46, plus 0.414 squared is ~0.17, plus 6.25 gives ~85.88? But that contradicts previous results. Wait, but hold on, if a=2.5, b\u22488.914, c\u22480.414, then the surface area would be 2(ab + bc + ac)=2*(2.5*8.914 +8.914*0.414 +2.5*0.414).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n2.5*8.914\u224822.285,\n\n8.914*0.414\u22483.696,\n\n2.5*0.414\u22481.035,\n\nTotal sum inside:22.285 +3.696 +1.035\u224827.016, which is close to 27, so that works. Volume is 2.5*8.914*0.414\u22482.5*3.696\u22489.24, but wait, that's not 23. Wait, hold on, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, bc was supposed to be 23/(a\u00b2)=23/(6.25)=3.68, so volume is a*b*c =2.5*(b*c)=2.5*3.68\u22489.2, which is not 23. Wait, so that's a problem. Wait, so my mistake here is that when I set a=2.5, then bc=23/(a\u00b2)=23/(6.25)=3.68, so volume is a*b*c= a*(b*c)=2.5*3.68\u22489.2, which is not 23. Wait, so that's a contradiction. Wait, so I must have messed up the equations.\n\nWait, hold on, if a=2.5, then volume is a*b*c=23, so bc=23/(2.5)=9.2, not 23/(a\u00b2). Wait, no, wait, volume is a*b*c=23, so bc=23/a. Wait, yes, that's right. Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier.\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nIf a is given, then bc = 23/a, not 23/a\u00b2. Wait, yes, because volume is a*b*c=23 \u21d2 bc=23/a. So my mistake earlier was in the calculation when I set a=2.5, bc should be 23/2.5=9.2, not 23/(2.5)^2. That was an error. Let me recalculate.\n\nSo, if a=2.5, then bc=23/2.5=9.2,\n\nSurface area: ab + bc + ac =2.5b +2.5c +9.2=27 \u21d22.5(b +c)=27 -9.2=17.8 \u21d2b +c=17.8/2.5=7.12,\n\nThus, variables b and c satisfy b +c=7.12 and bc=9.2,\n\nThus quadratic equation: t\u00b2 -7.12 t +9.2=0,\n\nDiscriminant: (7.12)^2 -4*9.2\u224850.69 -36.8\u224813.89,\n\nsqrt(13.89)\u22483.727,\n\nRoots: [7.12 \u00b13.727]/2,\n\nFirst root\u2248(10.847)/2\u22485.423,\n\nSecond root\u2248(3.393)/2\u22481.6965.\n\nThus, a=2.5, b\u22485.423, c\u22481.6965,\n\nThen, compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2\u22486.25 +29.4 +2.88\u224838.53, which is still less than 41.06.\n\nSo that's better than the previous wrong calculation but still less than 41.06.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the case when a=b=2 gives the highest sum so far. Let me check another case where a=1. Let me see, but as before, when a=1, bc=23, and surface area would be ab + bc +ac =b +c +23=27 \u21d2b +c=4. But bc=23 and b +c=4, which as before, discriminant negative, so no solution. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, let me try a= sqrt(23/c). Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of symmetric sums. Let me denote S = a + b + c, P = ab + bc + ac =27, R = abc=23.\n\nWe need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2P = S\u00b2 -54. So to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, we need to maximize S\u00b2, so maximize S.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to maximizing a + b + c given that ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again for maximizing S =a + b + c with constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using inequalities. Let me think.\n\nWe can consider that for positive real numbers a, b, c with fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the sum a + b + c is maximized when two variables are equal? Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, using the method of symmetric means. Let me recall that for three variables, with fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the sum a + b + c can be expressed in terms of the roots of the cubic equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Px - R =0, where S is the sum, P=27, R=23.\n\nThe roots are a, b, c. To maximize S, perhaps the roots need to be as spread out as possible? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the AM \u2265 GM inequality. But since we have fixed P and R, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that if two variables are equal, then we can parametrize as before, and see if that gives the maximum S.\n\nIn the case when a = b =2, c=23/4=5.75,\n\nThen S =2 +2 +5.75=9.75,\n\nAlternatively, when a\u22483.898, c\u22481.515, then S\u22483.898 +3.898 +1.515\u22489.311,\n\nWhich is less than 9.75.\n\nIn the case when a=2.5, b\u22485.423, c\u22481.6965, S\u22482.5 +5.423 +1.6965\u22489.6195, which is less than 9.75.\n\nSo the maximum S so far is 9.75, which gives a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (9.75)^2 -54\u224895.06 -54\u224841.06, which matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, this seems to be the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's a case where S is higher.\n\nSuppose a=1. Let me see, but as before, no solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me try a=1.5.\n\nThen bc=23/1.5\u224815.333,\n\nSurface area:1.5b +1.5c +15.333=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=11.6667 \u21d2b +c\u22487.7778,\n\nThus, variables b and c with b +c\u22487.7778 and bc\u224815.333,\n\nQuadratic equation: t\u00b2 -7.7778 t +15.333\u22480,\n\nDiscriminant\u2248(7.7778)^2 -4*15.333\u224860.5 -61.332\u2248-0.832,\n\nNegative discriminant, so no real solution. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm, so seems like the maximum S is indeed 9.75 when a=b=2, c=5.75.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is (9.75)^2 -54.\n\nLet me compute that exactly.\n\nFirst, 9.75 is 39/4, so (39/4)^2 = (39)^2 /16 = 1521/16,\n\nThus, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =1521/16 -54 =1521/16 - 864/16 = (1521 -864)/16 =657/16,\n\nTherefore, r\u00b2 is (657/16)/4 =657/64,\n\nWhich reduces to 657/64, as 657 and 64 share no common factors (since 657 is 3\u00d7219=3\u00d73\u00d773, and 64 is 2^6). So yes, coprime.\n\nTherefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nWait, but before I finish, let me check once more if there could be another case where variables are not two equal but give a higher S.\n\nSuppose that variables are a, b, c with a different from b and c, but arranged such that S is higher.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that one variable is larger than 2, but not equal to another.\n\nWait, let me try a=2. Let me see, if a=2, then as before, b=2, c=23/4. Alternatively, if a=2 but b\u2260c, would that give a higher S?\n\nWait, if a=2, then from the volume, bc=23/2=11.5,\n\nSurface area:2b +2c + bc=27,\n\nSo 2(b +c) +11.5=27 \u21d22(b +c)=15.5 \u21d2b +c=7.75,\n\nThus, with bc=11.5 and b +c=7.75,\n\nQuadratic equation: t\u00b2 -7.75 t +11.5=0,\n\nDiscriminant: (7.75)^2 -46\u224860.06 -46\u224814.06,\n\nsqrt(14.06)\u22483.75,\n\nRoots: [7.75 \u00b13.75]/2,\n\nFirst root\u2248(11.5)/2=5.75,\n\nSecond root\u2248(4)/2=2,\n\nThus, the solutions are b=5.75, c=2 or vice versa. So actually, this is the same as the case when a=b=2, c=5.75. So even if we set a=2 and let b and c vary, the maximum S occurs when b=c=2 or one is 5.75 and the other 2. Wait, but in this case, when a=2, and b and c are 5.75 and 2, then the sum S is 2 +5.75 +2=9.75, same as before. So indeed, the maximum occurs when two variables are 2 and the third is 5.75. So that is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, I think this is correct. So the answer is 657 +64=721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n</think>\n\nGiven the set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \\(r\\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius \\(r\\) is half the space diagonal of the box, so we need to maximize the space diagonal \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\\) for boxes with \\(2(ab + bc + ac) = 54\\) and \\(abc = 23\\).\n\nFirst, we note that the surface area constraint gives \\(ab + bc + ac = 27\\). We aim to maximize \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\). Using the identity \\((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)\\), we can express \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\) as \\((a + b + c)^2 - 54\\). Thus, maximizing \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\) is equivalent to maximizing \\((a + b + c)^2\\).\n\nWe consider the case where two variables are equal. Let \\(a = b\\). Then, the constraints become:\n\\[\na^2 + 2ac = 27 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a^2c = 23.\n\\]\nSolving for \\(c\\) from the volume equation, we get \\(c = \\frac{23}{a^2}\\). Substituting into the surface area equation:\n\\[\na^2 + 2a \\left(\\frac{23}{a^2}\\right) = 27 \\implies a^2 + \\frac{46}{a} = 27.\n\\]\nMultiplying through by \\(a\\) gives the cubic equation:\n\\[\na^3 - 27a + 46 = 0.\n\\]\nFactoring, we find \\(a = 2\\) is a root, leading to the factorization \\((a - 2)(a^2 + 2a - 23) = 0\\). The positive root of the quadratic factor is \\(a = -1 + 2\\sqrt{6}\\), but this gives a smaller value for \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\).\n\nFor \\(a = 2\\), we get \\(c = \\frac{23}{4} = 5.75\\). Thus, the sides are \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = 5.75\\). Calculating the sum of squares:\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \\left(\\frac{23}{4}\\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \\frac{529}{16} = \\frac{64 + 64 + 529}{16} = \\frac{657}{16}.\n\\]\nThe radius \\(r\\) is half the space diagonal, so:\n\\[\nr^2 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} = \\frac{657}{64}.\n\\]\nThus, \\(p = 657\\) and \\(q = 64\\), giving \\(p + q = 721\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{721}\n\\]",
