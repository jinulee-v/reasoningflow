        "question": "ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?\nA. At active promoters and enhancers\nB. At random locations in the genome\nC. In the introns of large genes\nD. At repeats",
        "response": "The disappearance of ChIP-seq peaks when switching from PFA (paraformaldehyde) fixation to PFA+DSG (dithiothreitol) fixation suggests that the fixation method is affecting the cross-linking of proteins to DNA, particularly for the IKAROS transcription factor. DSG is often used to reduce protein-protein crosslinks while maintaining protein-DNA interactions, which can sometimes lead to differences in the efficiency of chromatin immunoprecipitation.\n\nGiven this context, the most likely scenario is that the disappearing peaks are at sites where the interaction between IKAROS and DNA is more sensitive to changes in fixation conditions. Transcription factors like IKAROS are known to bind at regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, which are critical for gene expression regulation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. At active promoters and enhancers\n\nThis is because these regions are highly dynamic and sensitive to changes in chromatin structure and protein-DNA interactions, making them more susceptible to variations in fixation protocols."
