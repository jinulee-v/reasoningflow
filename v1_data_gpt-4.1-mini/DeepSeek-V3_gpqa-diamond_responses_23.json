        "question": "If an equimolar mixture X of two liquids, which decolorizes bromine water, is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation, which does not decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under rather severe conditions gives only one substance, a certain hydrocarbon Z (mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%), which is a constituent of mixture Y and widely used as a solvent. Substance Z does not react further with hydrogen. There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X.\nIndicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\nA. 18\nB. 12\nC. 22\nD. 16",
        "response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. This suggests that both liquids are unsaturated (contain double or triple bonds).\n\n2. **Hydrogenation of Mixture X**: When hydrogenated under severe conditions, it yields a single hydrocarbon Z. This implies that both liquids in mixture X can be hydrogenated to the same product Z.\n\n3. **Hydrocarbon Z**: The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. This means the molecular formula of Z can be determined as follows:\n   - Let the molecular formula of Z be \\( C_nH_{2n+2} \\) (since it's a saturated hydrocarbon).\n   - The mass fraction of hydrogen is \\( \\frac{2n+2}{12n + 2n + 2} = 0.1428 \\).\n   - Solving for \\( n \\), we find \\( n = 6 \\). Thus, Z is \\( C_6H_{14} \\) (hexane).\n\n4. **Mixture Y**: An equimolar mixture of two liquids formed from the disproportionation of mixture X. Mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, indicating that both liquids are saturated.\n\n5. **Hydrogenation of Mixture Y**: When hydrogenated under severe conditions, it also yields Z (hexane). This suggests that both liquids in mixture Y can be hydrogenated to hexane.\n\n6. **Substance Z**: Hexane is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. It does not react further with hydrogen, confirming it is fully saturated.\n\n7. **Mixture X**: Since both liquids in mixture X hydrogenate to hexane, they must be isomers of hexene (C6H12). The possible isomers are:\n   - 1-Hexene\n   - 2-Hexene\n   - 3-Hexene\n\n8. **Total Number of Hydrogen Atoms in Mixture X**: Each hexene molecule has 12 hydrogen atoms. Since mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two hexene isomers, the total number of hydrogen atoms is \\( 12 + 12 = 24 \\).\n\nHowever, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds of mixture X. This eliminates conjugated dienes, which would have fewer hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is indeed 24.\n\nBut wait, the options provided are:\nA. 18\nB. 12\nC. 22\nD. 16\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct answer should be 24, but since 24 is not among the options, there might be a misunderstanding. Let's reconsider:\n\nIf mixture X consists of two different hexene isomers, each with 12 hydrogen atoms, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the mixture would be \\( 12 + 12 = 24 \\). However, since 24 is not an option, let's check if there's a possibility of a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if mixture X consists of one hexene isomer and another compound with fewer hydrogen atoms, the total could be less than 24. But the problem states that both liquids in mixture X decolorize bromine water, indicating both are unsaturated hydrocarbons.\n\nGiven the options, the closest to our calculated total is 22, but this doesn't align with our analysis. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the given information is 24, but since it's not an option, there might be an error in the problem or the provided options.\n\nHowever, considering the problem's constraints and the options, the most reasonable answer is:\n\n**C. 22**"
