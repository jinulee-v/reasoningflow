        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty \u0394P_z for the given system. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127, and the state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). The question is asking for the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, let me recall how to calculate the uncertainty of an operator in a given state.\n\nThe uncertainty \u0394P_z is given by the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. So, \u0394P_z = sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). Since P_z is an operator, I need to compute these expectation values using the given state vector.\n\nFirst, let me note that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the given state vector is expressed in the P_z basis. The matrix for P_z is diagonal, with entries (\u0127, 0, -\u0127) along the diagonal. So, the eigenvalues of P_z are \u0127, 0, and -\u0127, corresponding to the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively.\n\nThe state vector provided is |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T. To compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to take the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8\u27e9, multiply by the P_z matrix, then multiply by |\u03c8\u27e9 again. Since all the components of the state vector are real numbers, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write the P_z matrix:\n\nP_z = \n[ \u0127   0    0  ]\n[ 0   0    0  ]\n[ 0   0  -\u0127 ]\n\nSo, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Let me compute that.\n\n\u03c8\u2020 is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]\n\nMultiplying \u03c8\u2020 by P_z:\n\nFirst element: (-1/2)*\u0127 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = (-\u0127/2)\nSecond element: (-1/2)*0 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = 0\nThird element: (-1/2)*0 + (1/\u221a2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-\u0127) = (\u0127/2)\n\nWait, hold on, actually, when multiplying matrices, the order is important. Let me correct that. The multiplication is \u03c8\u2020 * P_z * \u03c8. Let me do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is just the sum over i of \u03c8_i*(P_z)_ii * \u03c8_i. Since the basis is orthonormal, the expectation value simplifies to that.\n\nSo, since the state vector is in the P_z basis, each component squared times the corresponding eigenvalue gives the expectation value. Let me compute that.\n\nThe components of |\u03c8\u27e9 are:\n\n\u03c8\u2081 = -1/2,\n\n\u03c8\u2082 = 1/\u221a2,\n\n\u03c8\u2083 = -1/2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u2081|\u00b2*(\u0127) + |\u03c8\u2082|\u00b2*(0) + |\u03c8\u2083|\u00b2*(-\u0127)\n\nWait, hold on, actually, the eigenvalues for the basis vectors are:\n\nFirst basis vector (\u03c8\u2081 component) corresponds to eigenvalue \u0127,\n\nSecond basis vector (\u03c8\u2082 component) corresponds to eigenvalue 0,\n\nThird basis vector (\u03c8\u2083 component) corresponds to eigenvalue -\u0127.\n\nTherefore, the expectation value is:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (|\u03c8\u2081|\u00b2)(\u0127) + (|\u03c8\u2082|\u00b2)(0) + (|\u03c8\u2083|\u00b2)(-\u0127)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n|\u03c8\u2081|\u00b2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4,\n\n|\u03c8\u2082|\u00b2 = (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2,\n\n|\u03c8\u2083|\u00b2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u27e9 = (1/4)(\u0127) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\u0127) = (1/4 - 1/4)\u0127 = 0.\n\nHmm, interesting. The expectation value of P_z is zero. That's because the state has equal magnitude components in the first and third basis vectors, which have eigenvalues +\u0127 and -\u0127, so they cancel out, and the middle component is in the 0 eigenvalue state. So, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will just be the square of its diagonal entries. So, P_z\u00b2 is a diagonal matrix with entries (\u0127\u00b2, 0, \u0127\u00b2). Therefore, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum over |\u03c8_i|\u00b2*(P_z\u00b2)_ii.\n\nSo,\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = |\u03c8\u2081|\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2) + |\u03c8\u2082|\u00b2*(0) + |\u03c8\u2083|\u00b2*(\u0127\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = (1/4)(\u0127\u00b2) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(\u0127\u00b2) = (1/4 + 1/4)\u0127\u00b2 = (1/2)\u0127\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty squared is \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2 = (1/2 \u0127\u00b2) - 0 = 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. Therefore, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). So that would be option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to be sure.\n\nFirst, verifying the expectation value of P_z:\n\nYes, the first and third components squared are each 1/4, multiplied by \u0127 and -\u0127 respectively, so they cancel. The middle term is 1/2 times 0, so indeed 0. That's correct.\n\nThen, for P_z squared, since squaring the operator would square the eigenvalues, so the first and third eigenvalues become \u0127\u00b2 and \u0127\u00b2, so their contributions are each (1/4)(\u0127\u00b2). Adding those gives 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) = \u0127 / sqrt(2). So the answer should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the state vector is normalized. The problem says it's an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127, so it should be normalized. Let me confirm:\n\nThe state vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). The squared magnitudes are (1/4, 1/2, 1/4). Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question? The question says the system is in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -\u0127, and the explicit form is given. So that state is already provided, so we can just use it directly. Since the basis is the P_z basis, so the components are in terms of P_z eigenvectors. So all steps are okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the given state is indeed an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127? The problem states that, so perhaps we can take that as given, but just to confirm, maybe I can verify that quickly?\n\nGiven the matrix for P_x:\n\nFirst row: (0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0)\n\nSecond row: (\u0127/\u221a2, 0, \u0127/\u221a2)\n\nThird row: (0, \u0127/\u221a2, 0)\n\nSo, let's apply P_x to the given state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T and see if it gives -\u0127 |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nCompute P_x |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\nFirst component: 0*(-1/2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*(-1/2) = (\u0127/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) = \u0127/(2)\n\nSecond component: (\u0127/\u221a2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)*(-1/2) = ( - \u0127/(2\u221a2) ) + ( - \u0127/(2\u221a2) ) = - \u0127/\u221a2\n\nThird component: 0*(-1/2) + (\u0127/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*(-1/2) = same as first component: \u0127/2\n\nSo the result is [ \u0127/2, -\u0127/\u221a2, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nNow, if this is supposed to be equal to -\u0127 |\u03c8\u27e9, let's compute -\u0127 |\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n-\u0127 * [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T = [ \u0127/2, -\u0127/\u221a2, \u0127/2 ]^T.\n\nWhich matches exactly. So yes, the given state is indeed an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u0127. So that's confirmed. So the state is correct.\n\nTherefore, my calculation for \u0394P_z is correct. The uncertainty is \u0127 / sqrt(2), which is option C. Hmm, but let me check the options again:\n\nA. sqrt(2)\u0127\n\nB. \u0127\n\nC. \u0127/sqrt(2)\n\nD. \u0127/2\n\nYes, so C is the answer. Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the uncertainty in P_z. Since the expectation value is zero, the uncertainty is sqrt(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9). Since \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/2)\u0127\u00b2, so sqrt(1/2 \u0127\u00b2) is indeed \u0127/sqrt(2). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9? Let me recalculate that.\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is the sum over |\u03c8_i|\u00b2*(P_z eigenvalue)^2 for each component.\n\nFirst component: | -1/2 |\u00b2 * (\u0127)^2 = (1/4) * \u0127\u00b2\n\nSecond component: |1/\u221a2|\u00b2 * (0)^2 = (1/2)*0 = 0\n\nThird component: | -1/2 |\u00b2 * (-\u0127)^2 = (1/4)*\u0127\u00b2\n\nAdding them: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2, so 1/2 \u0127\u00b2. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. So I think that's correct. Hmm, but let me see if there's any other perspective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, and P_x and P_z don't commute, so the uncertainty should be non-zero, which it is. The calculation seems straightforward. I don't see any mistake here. So I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo find the uncertainty \\(\\Delta P_z\\) for the given system, we use the formula \\(\\Delta P_z = \\sqrt{\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle P_z \\rangle^2}\\).\n\nGiven the state vector \\(|\\psi\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\ -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}\\), which is an eigenstate of \\(P_x\\) with eigenvalue \\(-\\hbar\\), we first calculate the expectation value \\(\\langle P_z \\rangle\\).\n\nThe matrix form of \\(P_z\\) is:\n\\[\nP_z = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hbar & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -\\hbar\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe expectation value \\(\\langle P_z \\rangle\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\sum_i |\\psi_i|^2 \\cdot (\\text{eigenvalue of } P_z \\text{ for basis } i)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left| -\\frac{1}{2} \\right|^2 \\cdot \\hbar + \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right|^2 \\cdot 0 + \\left| -\\frac{1}{2} \\right|^2 \\cdot (-\\hbar)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\langle P_z \\rangle = \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\hbar \\right) + 0 + \\left( \\frac{1}{4} (-\\hbar) \\right) = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\(\\langle P_z^2 \\rangle\\).
