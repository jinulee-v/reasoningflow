        "response": "The molecular mechanism responsible for the less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to Down's syndrome is related to **C. chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote**.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Klinefelter's Syndrome (47,XXY)**:\n   - This condition arises due to nondisjunction during meiosis, resulting in an extra X chromosome in males.\n   - The presence of an extra X chromosome leads to inactivation of most of its genes through **X-inactivation**, a process mediated by chromatin methylation and histone modifications. This reduces the phenotypic impact of the extra chromosome.\n\n2. **Down's Syndrome (47,XX/XY,+21)**:\n   - This condition results from trisomy of chromosome 21, which does not undergo inactivation.\n   - The extra chromosome 21 remains active, leading to overexpression of its genes and more severe phenotypic consequences.\n\n3. **Chromatin Methylation**:\n   - In Klinefelter's syndrome, histone methyltransferases and other epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) play a role in silencing the extra X chromosome, mitigating its effects.\n   - This epigenetic regulation is not applicable to trisomy 21, as autosomes do not undergo inactivation.\n\n### Why Not the Other Options?\n- **A. Progression of polymerase alpha**: This is related to DNA replication and is not specific to the phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome.\n- **B. Attachment of spindle to kinetochores**: This is a meiotic process and does not explain the phenotypic differences post-fertilization.\n- **D. Chiasmata resolution by separase**: This is a meiotic event and does not account for the epigenetic regulation of X chromosomes in Klinefelter's syndrome.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C. chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote**."
