        "question": "You have prepared an unknown compound. To identify the product, you have used the following characterisation techniques: FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. A strong absorption peak is also observed at 1700 wavenumbers. Several peaks were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, none of which are correspond to vinyl-hydrogens. One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Identify the compound as either, CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH, CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH, CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH, or CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH\nA. CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH\nB.

However, **Option A** has ethyl groups (C2H5) directly attached to the carbon chain, which would lead to more complex splitting patterns in the 1H NMR spectrum compared to **Option D**, where the ethyl groups are further away from the carboxylic acid group. Therefore, **Option A** is the most likely compound.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer:**\n**A. CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**"
