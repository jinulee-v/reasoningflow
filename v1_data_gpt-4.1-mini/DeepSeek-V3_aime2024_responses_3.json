        "question": "Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",
        "response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm still getting the hang of game theory, but I'll try my best to understand and solve this.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nWe have a game with the following rules:\n\n- There's a stack of \\( n \\) tokens.\n- Two players, Alice and Bob, take turns removing tokens.\n- Alice goes first.\n- On each turn, a player can remove either 1 token or 4 tokens.\n- The player who removes the last token wins.\n\nOur goal is to find out how many positive integers \\( n \\) (where \\( n \\leq 2024 \\)) allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.\n\n### Breaking Down the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for Bob to have a winning strategy. Essentially, Bob can always make moves that lead him to win, regardless of Alice's moves.\n\nTo find this, I think I need to analyze the game for different values of \\( n \\) and see for which \\( n \\) Bob can force a win.\n\n### Starting with Small Values of \\( n \\)\n\nLet's start by examining small values of \\( n \\) to see if we can spot a pattern.\n\n1. **\\( n = 1 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token and wins.\n   - Bob doesn't get a chance to play.\n   - **Bob cannot win.**\n\n2. **\\( n = 2 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 1.\n   - Bob removes the last token and wins.\n   - **Bob can win.**\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If Alice removes 1 token, leaving 1, then Bob removes the last token and wins. So, Bob can win when \\( n = 2 \\).\n\nBut let's check if Alice has another option.\n\n   - Alice could also remove 4 tokens, but there are only 2 tokens, so she can't remove 4.\n   - Therefore, Alice must remove 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob to win.\n   - **Bob can win when \\( n = 2 \\).**\n\n3. **\\( n = 3 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 2.\n     - Bob removes 1 token, leaving 1.\n     - Alice removes the last token and wins.\n   - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, but she can't since there are only 3.\n   - So, Alice removes 1, Bob removes 1, Alice wins.\n   - **Bob cannot win.**\n\nWait, let's see if Bob has a better move.\n\n   - After Alice removes 1, leaving 2, Bob could remove 4 tokens, but he can't.\n   - So, Bob must remove 1, leaving 1 for Alice to win.\n   - **Bob cannot win when \\( n = 3 \\).**\n\n4. **\\( n = 4 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 3.\n     - Bob removes 1 token, leaving 2.\n       - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 1.\n       - Bob removes the last token and wins.\n     - Or Bob removes 4 tokens, but he can't.\n     - So, Bob removes 1, Alice removes 1, Bob wins.\n   - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, winning immediately.\n   - If Alice removes 4, she wins.\n   - If Alice removes 1, Bob can win.\n   - So, Alice can choose to remove 4 and win.\n   - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 4 \\).**\n\nWait, but if Alice removes 1, Bob can win. But Alice can also remove 4 and win. So, Alice has a winning strategy.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 4 \\).**\n\n5. **\\( n = 5 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 4.\n     - Bob removes 1 token, leaving 3.\n       - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 2.\n         - Bob removes 1 token, leaving 1.\n           - Alice removes the last token and wins.\n     - Or Bob removes 4 tokens, winning immediately.\n     - So, Bob can choose to remove 4 and win.\n   - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 1.\n     - Bob removes the last token and wins.\n   - In both cases, Bob can win.\n   - **Bob can win when \\( n = 5 \\).**\n\n6. **\\( n = 6 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 5.\n     - Bob can win as per \\( n = 5 \\).\n   - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 2.\n     - Bob removes 1 token, leaving 1.\n       - Alice removes the last token and wins.\n   - So, Alice can choose to remove 4, leaving 2, and win.\n   - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 6 \\).**\n\n7. **\\( n = 7 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 6.\n     - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 6 \\).\n   - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 3.\n     - Bob removes 1 token, leaving 2.\n       - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 1.\n         - Bob removes the last token and wins.\n     - Or Bob removes 4 tokens, but he can't.\n     - So, Bob removes 1, Alice removes 1, Bob wins.\n   - If Alice removes 4, Bob can win.\n   - If Alice removes 1, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n   - So, Alice can choose to remove 1, leading to Bob not being able to guarantee a win.\n   - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 7 \\).**\n\nWait, let's double-check:\n\n   - Alice removes 1, leaving 6: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n   - Alice removes 4, leaving 3: Bob can win.\n   - So, Alice can choose to remove 1, preventing Bob from guaranteeing a win.\n   - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 7 \\).**\n\n8. **\\( n = 8 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 7.\n     - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 7 \\).\n   - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 4.\n     - Bob removes 1 token, leaving 3.\n       - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 2.\n         - Bob removes 1 token, leaving 1.\n           - Alice removes the last token and wins.\n     - Or Bob removes 4 tokens, winning immediately.\n     - So, Bob can choose to remove 4 and win.\n   - If Alice removes 1, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n   - If Alice removes 4, Bob can win.\n   - So, Alice can choose to remove 1, preventing Bob from guaranteeing a win.\n   - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 8 \\).**\n\nWait, but if Alice removes 4, Bob can win. If Alice removes 1, Bob cannot guarantee a win. So, Alice can choose to remove 1, preventing Bob from guaranteeing a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 8 \\).**\n\n### Observing the Pattern\n\nFrom the above analysis:\n\n- \\( n = 1 \\): Bob cannot win.\n- \\( n = 2 \\): Bob can win.\n- \\( n = 3 \\): Bob cannot win.\n- \\( n = 4 \\): Bob cannot win.\n- \\( n = 5 \\): Bob can win.\n- \\( n = 6 \\): Bob cannot win.\n- \\( n = 7 \\): Bob cannot win.\n- \\( n = 8 \\): Bob cannot win.\n\nIt seems that Bob can win when \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\). Let's check a few more to see if a pattern emerges.\n\n9. **\\( n = 9 \\)**\n   - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 8.\n     - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 8 \\).\n   - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 5.\n     - Bob can win as per \\( n = 5 \\).\n   - So, Alice can choose to remove 4, leaving 5, and Bob can win.\n   - **Bob can win when \\( n = 9 \\).**\n\nWait, but if Alice removes 4, leaving 5, Bob can win. If Alice removes 1, leaving 8, Bob cannot guarantee a win. So, Alice can choose to remove 4, allowing Bob to win.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If Alice removes 4, leaving 5, Bob can win. But Alice wants to win, so she wouldn't choose a move that allows Bob to win. Therefore, Alice would choose to remove 1, leaving 8, where Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 9 \\).**\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf Alice removes 1, leaving 8: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nIf Alice removes 4, leaving 5: Bob can win.\nAlice wants to win, so she would choose to remove 1, leaving 8, preventing Bob from guaranteeing a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 9 \\).**\n\n10. **\\( n = 10 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 9.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 9 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 6.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 6 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 10 \\).**\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nIf Alice removes 1, leaving 9: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nIf Alice removes 4, leaving 6: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nSo, in both cases, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 10 \\).**\n\n11. **\\( n = 11 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 10.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 10 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 7.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 7 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 11 \\).**\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nIf Alice removes 1, leaving 10: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nIf Alice removes 4, leaving 7: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nSo, in both cases, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 11 \\).**\n\n12. **\\( n = 12 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 11.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 11 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 8.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 8 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 12 \\).**\n\nWait, but let's verify:\n\nIf Alice removes 1, leaving 11: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nIf Alice removes 4, leaving 8: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nSo, in both cases, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 12 \\).**\n\n13. **\\( n = 13 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 12.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 12 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 9.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 9 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 13 \\).**\n\nWait, but let's confirm:\n\nIf Alice removes 1, leaving 12: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nIf Alice removes 4, leaving 9: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nSo, in both cases, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 13 \\).**\n\n14. **\\( n = 14 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 13.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 13 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 10.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 10 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 14 \\).**\n\nWait, but let's verify:\n\nIf Alice removes 1, leaving 13: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nIf Alice removes 4, leaving 10: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nSo, in both cases, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 14 \\).**\n\n15. **\\( n = 15 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 14.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 14 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 11.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 11 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 15 \\).**\n\nWait, but let's confirm:\n\nIf Alice removes 1, leaving 14: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nIf Alice removes 4, leaving 11: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nSo, in both cases, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 15 \\).**\n\n16. **\\( n = 16 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 15.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 15 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 12.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 12 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 16 \\).**\n\nWait, but let's verify:\n\nIf Alice removes 1, leaving 15: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nIf Alice removes 4, leaving 12: Bob cannot guarantee a win.\nSo, in both cases, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 16 \\).**\n\n### Identifying the Pattern\n\nFrom the above analysis, it seems that Bob can only guarantee a win when \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\). For other values up to \\( n = 16 \\), Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nBut let's check a few more to be sure.\n\n17. **\\( n = 17 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 16.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 16 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 13.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 13 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 17 \\).**\n\n18. **\\( n = 18 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 17.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 17 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 14.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 14 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 18 \\).**\n\n19. **\\( n = 19 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 18.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 18 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 15.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 15 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 19 \\).**\n\n20. **\\( n = 20 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 19.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 19 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 16.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 16 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 20 \\).**\n\n### Generalizing the Pattern\n\nFrom the analysis up to \\( n = 20 \\), it appears that Bob can only guarantee a win when \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\). For all other values, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nBut let's see if this pattern continues.\n\n21. **\\( n = 21 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 20.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 20 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 17.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 17 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 21 \\).**\n\n22. **\\( n = 22 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 21.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 21 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 18.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 18 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 22 \\).**\n\n23. **\\( n = 23 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 22.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 22 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 19.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 19 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 23 \\).**\n\n24. **\\( n = 24 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 23.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 23 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 20.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 20 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 24 \\).**\n\n25. **\\( n = 25 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 24.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 24 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 21.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 21 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 25 \\).**\n\n### Conclusion from the Pattern\n\nFrom \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 25 \\), Bob can only guarantee a win when \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\). For all other values, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nThis suggests that Bob can only guarantee a win when \\( n \\) is congruent to 2 or 5 modulo 5.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\n### Testing the Hypothesis\n\nLet's check \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n- \\( 6 \\mod 5 = 1 \\)\n- According to the hypothesis, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n- From our earlier analysis, Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 6 \\).\n\n\\( n = 7 \\):\n\n- \\( 7 \\mod 5 = 2 \\)\n- According to the hypothesis, Bob can guarantee a win.\n- But from our earlier analysis, Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nWait, this contradicts our hypothesis.\n\nSo, our initial hypothesis that Bob can guarantee a win when \\( n \\equiv 2 \\) or \\( 5 \\mod 5 \\) is incorrect because \\( n = 7 \\equiv 2 \\mod 5 \\), but Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, we need to refine our hypothesis.\n\n### Refining the Hypothesis\n\nLet's look at the values where Bob can guarantee a win:\n\n- \\( n = 2 \\)\n- \\( n = 5 \\)\n\nLet's see if these values follow a specific pattern.\n\nLooking at the differences:\n\n- \\( 5 - 2 = 3 \\)\n\nIs there a pattern where Bob can guarantee a win every 3 numbers?\n\nLet's check:\n\nNext expected value: \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\)\n\nBut from our earlier analysis, Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 8 \\).\n\nSo, this pattern doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if Bob can guarantee a win when \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 5k + 2 \\).\n\nLet's test:\n\nFor \\( k = 0 \\): \\( n = 2 \\) \u2192 Bob can win.\nFor \\( k = 1 \\): \\( n = 7 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\nFor \\( k = 2 \\): \\( n = 12 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\n\nThis doesn't seem to hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Bob can guarantee a win when \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 5k + 2 \\) or \\( 5k + 5 \\).\n\nWait, \\( 5k + 5 = 5(k+1) \\), which is just multiples of 5.\n\nBut \\( n = 5 \\) \u2192 Bob can win.\n\\( n = 10 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\n\\( n = 15 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\n\nSo, this doesn't hold either.\n\nPerhaps Bob can guarantee a win when \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 5k + 2 \\).\n\nBut \\( n = 2 \\) \u2192 Bob can win.\n\\( n = 7 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\n\\( n = 12 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\n\nThis doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Bob can guarantee a win when \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 5k + 2 \\) or \\( 5k + 5 \\), but only for certain \\( k \\).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n\\( n = 2 \\) \u2192 \\( k = 0 \\)\n\\( n = 5 \\) \u2192 \\( k = 1 \\)\n\\( n = 7 \\) \u2192 \\( k = 1 \\)\n\\( n = 12 \\) \u2192 \\( k = 2 \\)\n\\( n = 17 \\) \u2192 \\( k = 3 \\)\n\nFrom our earlier analysis:\n\n\\( n = 2 \\) \u2192 Bob can win.\n\\( n = 5 \\) \u2192 Bob can win.\n\\( n = 7 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\n\\( n = 12 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\n\\( n = 17 \\) \u2192 Bob cannot win.\n\nSo, Bob can guarantee a win only at \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\).\n\nThis suggests that Bob can guarantee a win only at specific isolated points, not following a simple modulo pattern.\n\n### Extending the Analysis\n\nGiven that Bob can only guarantee a win at \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\), let's see if this pattern continues beyond \\( n = 25 \\).\n\n26. **\\( n = 26 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 25.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 25 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 22.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 22 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 26 \\).**\n\n27. **\\( n = 27 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 26.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 26 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 23.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 23 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 27 \\).**\n\n28. **\\( n = 28 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 27.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 27 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 24.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 24 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 28 \\).**\n\n29. **\\( n = 29 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 28.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 28 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 25.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 25 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 29 \\).**\n\n30. **\\( n = 30 \\)**\n    - Alice removes 1 token, leaving 29.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 29 \\).\n    - Or Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 26.\n      - Bob cannot guarantee a win as per \\( n = 26 \\).\n    - So, no matter what Alice does, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n    - **Bob cannot guarantee a win when \\( n = 30 \\).**\n\n### Observing the Trend\n\nFrom \\( n = 1 \\) to \\( n = 30 \\), Bob can only guarantee a win at \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\). For all other values, Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nThis suggests that Bob can only guarantee a win at specific isolated points, not following a simple modulo pattern.\n\n### Formulating the General Rule\n\nBased on the analysis, Bob can guarantee a win only when \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\). For all other values of \\( n \\), Bob cannot guarantee a win.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is the number of times \\( n = 2 \\) or \\( n = 5 \\) appears in the range from 1 to 2024.\n\nSince \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\) are distinct and both are less than or equal to 2024, the count is 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{2}\\)"
