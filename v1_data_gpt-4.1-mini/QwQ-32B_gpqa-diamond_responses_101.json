        "question": "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\nA. the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\nB. ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\nC. the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\nD. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame",
        "response": "Okay, let me try to work through this question step by step. So the problem is about a bicistronic lox-Cre vector used to study a new ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. The user is asking why there's no green signal (eGFP) observed in the offspring when they're visualized under a confocal microscope. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is the most likely reason.\n\nFirst, let me recap the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it can produce two proteins from one mRNA. The ligand is at the 5' end fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a constitutive promoter, so it should be expressed without needing Cre. The receptor part is after an IRES element. Wait, but between the ligand and mCherry there's a stop codon in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. \n\nSo, the structure is probably like this: CBA promoter drives transcription of the ligand ORF, then a stop codon flanked by loxP sites. Then an IRES, followed by the receptor ORF, which is also followed by a stop codon flanked by lox2272 sites. Wait, but the description says \"between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.\" Hmm, maybe the ligand is fused to mCherry but separated by a stop that's flanked by loxP? Wait, perhaps the ligand is in frame with mCherry but the stop is in between, so Cre would remove the stop, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed? Similarly, the receptor and eGFP are separated by a stop in a lox2272 cassette, so Cre would remove that stop to allow receptor-eGFP expression. But since they used SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest cells, the Cre would excise the stop sequences, allowing both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.\n\nWait, but the bicistronic vector: the ligand is at the 5' position fused to mCherry, but with a stop in between? Maybe the ligand is first, then a stop flanked by loxP, so when Cre is present, the stop is removed, so ligand is translated, then continues into mCherry? Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES, but the receptor and eGFP are separated by a stop flanked by lox2272. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, so receptor is translated and continues into eGFP. \n\nWait, but the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor. So the mRNA would have the ligand (with possible stop), then IRES, then receptor (with possible stop before eGFP). The IRES allows for internal ribosomal entry, so the receptor could be translated even if the ligand is not. But the stops are in the way unless Cre removes them. \n\nSo in the absence of Cre, the ligand would have a stop before mCherry, so ligand is expressed but not mCherry. The receptor would have a stop before eGFP, so receptor is expressed but not eGFP. But with Cre, the stops are removed, so ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are expressed. \n\nThe problem is that when they crossed the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre (which is hemizygous, so the offspring would be heterozygous for Cre), they don't see green (eGFP). So why isn't the eGFP being expressed?\n\nPossible issues: \n\nOption D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop was removed but the reading frame between receptor and eGFP is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed properly. That could lead to no green signal. \n\nOption A: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, maybe it's retained in the Golgi, but eGFP is part of the receptor's C-terminus, so maybe it's still present but not visible? But if it's stuck in the Golgi, maybe it's still fluorescent but not in the cytoplasm? Not sure. \n\nOption B: Paracrine relationship. If the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, meaning they act on different cells, maybe the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on another cell. But the construct is in the same cell? Wait, the ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices, which might be a secreted protein? If the ligand is secreted, then the receptor on the same cell might not get activated, but the eGFP is just a tag, so even if the ligand is paracrine, the eGFP should still be expressed. Unless the receptor isn't being properly expressed because the ligand isn't present? But the eGFP is fused to the receptor, so even if the receptor isn't activated, it should still be there. So maybe B is not the reason for no eGFP. \n\nOption C: Enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe the enhancer isn't needed? Unless the IRES requires an enhancer? Not sure. The problem states that the ligand is under CBA, so maybe the receptor's expression via IRES might depend on the first cistron's promoter? Wait, IRES allows for translation of the second cistron even if the first is not translated, but maybe the efficiency is lower. But if the stop is removed, then the receptor should be translated. Unless the IRES isn't working, but the question says they tested the construct in Western blot after transfection into astrocytes and saw signals proportional to actin. Wait, the user says they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes and did Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the construct works in vitro, then maybe in vivo the problem is different. \n\nWait, the problem says that after breeding the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre, the offspring don't show green. But in the transfection experiment, they did see the proteins. So maybe in vivo, the Cre isn't excising the stop properly? Or maybe the Cre is not present in the right cells? Wait, SOX10-Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, so if the construct is in the neural crest cells, then Cre should be there. But maybe the lox2272 sites are not compatible with Cre? Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different, but Cre can excise between loxP and lox2272? Wait, no, Cre can only excise between two loxP sites. Wait, actually, lox2272 is a mutant version that can be used with flippase, but maybe in this case, the stop between receptor and eGFP is flanked by lox2272 sites. So if the Cre is present, but the lox2272 sites can't be excised by Cre, then the stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Wait, but the question says the stop between receptor and eGFP is in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So that's flanked by two lox2272 sites. Cre can excise between loxP and loxP, or between lox2272 and lox2272? Wait, I think lox2272 is a mutant that is not recognized by Cre unless there's another site. Wait, actually, Cre can excise between two loxP sites, but between lox2272 and lox2272, it can also excise, but maybe the orientation matters. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation? Or maybe the Cre can't excise the lox2272-flanked stop because it's a different site. Wait, but the question states that between the receptor and eGFP is a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. So if Cre is present, it should excise the stop, allowing receptor-eGFP to be in frame. But maybe the lox2272 sites are not compatible with Cre? Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant that can be used with Cre, but perhaps in a different orientation. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the construct design, such that the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation so Cre can't excise the stop. But the question doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame even after excision. \n\nWait, the question says \"between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.\" So the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is present, it removes the stop, so the receptor's ORF is followed by eGFP's ORF. But if the stop was in between, then after excision, the receptor and eGFP should be in frame. Unless the cloning was done wrong, so that even after removing the stop, the reading frame is off. That would be option D. \n\nThe user also mentions that they tested the construct in Western blot after transfection into astrocytes. If in vitro it worked (they saw the proteins), then in vivo maybe the problem is different. Wait, but if in the transfection they saw the eGFP signal, then in vivo it should also work. Unless in the transfection they used a different Cre? Wait, the problem says they used the plasmid transfection into primary astrocytes and tested with antibodies. The construct in the plasmid would have the stops unless Cre is present. So maybe in the transfection experiment, they used a Cre-expressing plasmid to test the construct? The question says \"after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture.\" It doesn't mention adding Cre, so maybe the construct in the plasmid has the stops, so without Cre, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Wait, but the question says \"the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element.\" So the receptor is after the IRES. So maybe in the plasmid transfection, the ligand is expressed (since CBA is active), but the receptor would be expressed via IRES. But the stops are still there unless Cre is present. So unless they used Cre in the transfection, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Wait, but the question says they \"use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture.\" Maybe they used Cre in the transfection? The problem is a bit unclear here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Western blot showed that the proteins were expressed, so the construct works in vitro. Therefore, the problem in vivo must be something else. \n\nThe fact that the offspring don't show green (eGFP) suggests that the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't being expressed. The possible reasons are either the stop wasn't removed (so eGFP isn't translated), or the fusion is not in frame (so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't properly expressed). \n\nIf the stop between receptor and eGFP is flanked by lox2272 sites, then Cre should excise it. But maybe the Cre is not present in the cells where the construct is? Wait, the construct is bred into the mice, and crossed with SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so if the construct is in the neural crest cells, then Cre should be there. But maybe the construct is not expressed in those cells? Wait, the ligand is under CBA, which is a constitutive promoter, so the ligand should be expressed regardless. The receptor is after IRES, so maybe it's expressed as well. But the eGFP part requires the stop to be removed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, Cre can't excise. But the question doesn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame (option D). If the stop was removed but the reading frame between the receptor and eGFP is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. That would explain no green signal. Since in the transfection they might have used a different setup (maybe with correct frame), but in the mouse construct, there was a mistake in cloning, leading to frameshift. \n\nAlternatively, option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so maybe the enhancer isn't needed. Unless the IRES requires an enhancer? Not sure. \n\nOption B: paracrine relationship. If the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on another cell, but the eGFP is on the same cell's receptor, so even if the ligand is paracrine, the eGFP should still be present. Unless the receptor isn't expressed because the ligand isn't present? But the eGFP is a tag, so it should be there regardless. \n\nOption A: stuck in Golgi. If the receptor is a transmembrane protein, maybe the eGFP is stuck in the Golgi and not transported to the cell surface, but it should still be visible in the cytoplasm. Unless the antibody didn't detect it, but the question is about fluorescence, not Western blot. Wait, the problem says they used antibodies in the Western blot, but the lack of green signal is from the microscope. So if the eGFP is present but not fluorescent, maybe it's not being translated properly. \n\nPutting it all together, the most likely answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop was removed but the frame is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. The fact that in the transfection they saw the proteins (maybe they used a correct construct in vitro but the mouse construct had a frameshift) could be possible. Alternatively, maybe in the transfection they used Cre, so the eGFP was expressed, but in the mouse, the Cre didn't excise properly? Wait, but the lox2272 sites might not be compatible. Wait, lox2272 is a mutant that can be used with Cre, but maybe the orientation is wrong. For example, if the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, Cre can't excise. But the question doesn't specify orientation. Alternatively, maybe the stop between the receptor and eGFP is flanked by lox2272 sites, so Cre can remove it, but if the loxP and lox2272 are different, maybe the Cre can't excise between them? Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant that can be used with Cre, but requires specific orientation. Maybe the user made a mistake in the construct design, such that the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation, so the stop isn't removed. But the question doesn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Since the question mentions that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct in Western blot, which worked. If the construct in the plasmid was correct (so in vitro it worked with Cre), but in the mouse, maybe the construct was inserted into the genome in a way that disrupted the reading frame? Wait, but the question says they bred a mouse model homozygous for the construct. So the construct was correctly inserted. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. The bicistronic vector has the ligand ORF at 5' fused to mCherry, with a stop between them in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The receptor is at 3', fused to eGFP with a stop between them in lox2272-stop-lox2272. The IRES is upstream of the receptor. \n\nSo the mRNA structure is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop (loxP-stop-loxP) -> mCherry? Wait, no. Wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but separated by a stop. So the ligand is first, then a stop, then mCherry? Or is the ligand in frame with mCherry but with a stop in between that can be removed by Cre? \n\nWait, perhaps the ligand is in frame with mCherry, but there's a stop codon between them, flanked by loxP. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing ligand-mCherry to be expressed as a fusion. Similarly, the receptor is in frame with eGFP, but with a stop between them flanked by lox2272. So when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing receptor-eGFP. \n\nIf that's the case, then in the absence of Cre, ligand is expressed but not mCherry, and receptor is expressed but not eGFP. With Cre, both fusions are expressed. \n\nThe problem is that in the mice, they don't see green (eGFP). So why? \n\nPossible issues: \n\n1. The Cre didn't excise the lox2272-flanked stop. Maybe because the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if both are in the same orientation, Cre can't excise. But the question doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the lox2272 sites are not compatible with Cre? Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant that can be used with Cre, but requires specific orientation. \n\nAlternatively, the stop between receptor and eGFP wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. \n\nBut why would that be? If the Cre is present (SOX10-Cre in neural crest cells), then the lox2272 sites should allow excision. Unless the lox2272 is in the wrong orientation. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Even if the stop is removed, if the reading frame is off, the eGFP won't be expressed. That would be option D. \n\nThe fact that in the transfection they saw the proteins (with Western blot) suggests that in vitro, when the construct is transfected along with Cre (maybe?), the eGFP was expressed. But in the mouse, maybe the construct was inserted into the genome in a way that caused a frameshift? Or perhaps the cloning was done wrong, so the eGFP is out of frame. Since the question states that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct, which worked, maybe the in vitro construct was correct, but in the mouse, due to genomic insertion, the frame was disrupted. But the question says the mouse is homozygous for the construct, implying it's correctly inserted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working properly in vivo, so the receptor isn't translated. But the ligand is under CBA, so it should be expressed. The eGFP depends on the receptor's expression and the stop removal. \n\nHmm. Another angle: the bicistronic vector uses IRES between ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so it's translated first. The receptor is after IRES, so it's translated via IRES. But if the stop between receptor and eGFP is not removed (because Cre didn't excise it), then the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. \n\nWait, but the stop between receptor and eGFP is flanked by lox2272. If Cre is present, it should remove the stop. If not, then no eGFP. \n\nWhy wouldn't Cre remove it? Maybe the Cre is not present in those cells. Wait, SOX10-Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. If the construct is in neural crest cells, then Cre should be there. But maybe the construct is not expressed in neural crest cells? The CBA promoter is a ubiquitous promoter, so it should be expressed everywhere. \n\nAlternatively, the lox2272 sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the two lox2272 sites are in the same orientation, Cre can't excise between them. Because Cre requires the two lox sites to be in opposite orientations. So if both are in the same direction, the excision won't happen. That would mean the stop remains, so no eGFP. But the question doesn't mention orientation. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame (option D). Even if the stop is removed, if the reading frame is off, the eGFP won't be expressed. Since the user tested the construct in vitro and saw the proteins, maybe in vitro they used a correct construct, but in the mouse, there was a frameshift. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the eGFP is present but not fluorescent. For example, if the receptor is stuck in the Golgi (option A), but then the eGFP would still be fluorescent in the Golgi. Unless the antibody didn't detect it, but the question is about fluorescence microscopy. \n\nHmm. The most likely answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop was removed but the frame is wrong, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. The fact that in vitro it worked suggests that in the plasmid, the frame was correct, but in the mouse construct, perhaps due to cloning error, the frame was off. Since the question mentions that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct, which worked, maybe the in vitro construct was correct, but in the mouse, the genomic insertion caused a frameshift. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bicistronic vector's IRES isn't efficient enough, so the receptor isn't translated much, but the eGFP would still be there if the stop was removed. \n\nAlternatively, the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship (B), but that wouldn't affect the expression of eGFP, just the signaling. \n\nHmm. I think the best answer is D. Because if the fusion is out of frame, then even with the stop removed, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. The other options don't fit as well. The problem states that in the transfection, they saw the proteins, so the construct works in vitro, implying that the frame was correct there. But in the mouse, maybe the genomic insertion caused a frameshift. Or perhaps during cloning, the eGFP was inserted out of frame. Since the question is about the most likely reason, D seems plausible.\n</think>\n\nThe most likely reason for the absence of green (eGFP) fluorescence in the offspring is **D. the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Construct Design**:\n   - The bicistronic vector uses a **CBA promoter** for the ligand, followed by a **loxP-stop-loxP cassette** between the ligand and mCherry. \n   - The receptor is downstream of an **IRES element**, with a **lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette** between the receptor and eGFP.\n   - **Cre-mediated excision** of the stop codons should allow ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP expression in cells where SOX10-Cre is active (neural crest cells).\n\n2. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - In neural crest cells, Cre should remove the stops, enabling translation of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. The absence of green fluorescence suggests a failure in eGFP expression despite Cre activity.\n\n3. **Critical Issues**:\n   - **Option D (Frame Shift)**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame after Cre removes the stop, the eGFP sequence would be mistranslated, resulting in no functional GFP. This is plausible because:\n     - The Western blot confirmed construct functionality *in vitro*, implying correct design in the plasmid. However, genomic insertion during mouse breeding could introduce a frameshift mutation (e.g., cloning error or integration artifact).\n     - A frameshift would prevent eGFP expression regardless of Cre activity, directly explaining the lack of fluorescence.\n\n4. **Eliminating Other Options**:\n   - **A (Golgi retention)**: While transmembrane proteins can localize to the Golgi, eGFP fused to the receptor\u2019s C-terminus should still fluoresce intracellularly. The absence of *any* signal suggests no expression, not just mislocalization.\n   - **B (Paracrine relationship)**: Paracrine signaling affects ligand-receptor interaction, not eGFP expression. The eGFP tag should still be visible even if the ligand acts on distant cells.\n   - **C (Missing enhancer)**: The CBA promoter is constitutive and does not require enhancers for basic expression. The IRES ensures receptor translation even without ligand-driven transcription, so enhancer loss is unlikely to block eGFP entirely.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most parsimonious explanation is a frameshift between the receptor and eGFP, preventing proper translation of the fusion protein. This aligns with the observation that the construct worked *in vitro* (suggesting correct design in plasmids) but failed *in vivo*, pointing to a genomic integration or cloning error in the mouse model. \n\n**Answer: D. the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame.**"

Unless the lox2272 is in the wrong orientation. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Even if the stop is removed, if the reading frame is off, the eGFP won't be expressed. That would be option D. \n\nThe fact that in the transfection they saw the proteins (with Western blot) suggests that in vitro, when the construct is transfected along with Cre (maybe?), the eGFP was expressed. But in the mouse, maybe the construct was inserted into the genome in a way that caused a frameshift? Or perhaps the cloning was done wrong, so the eGFP is out of frame. Since the question states that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct, which worked, maybe the in vitro construct was correct, but in the mouse, due to genomic insertion, the frame was disrupted. But the question says the mouse is homozygous for the construct, implying it's correctly inserted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working properly in vivo, so the receptor isn't translated. But the ligand is under CBA, so it should be expressed. The eGFP depends on the receptor's expression and the stop removal. \n\nHmm. Another angle: the bicistronic vector uses IRES between ligand and receptor. The ligand is under CBA, so it's translated first. The receptor is after IRES, so it's translated via IRES. But if the stop between receptor and eGFP is not removed (because Cre didn't excise it), then the receptor is expressed but not eGFP. \n\nWait, but the stop between receptor and eGFP is flanked by lox2272.

            "text": "Since the question is about the most likely reason, D seems plausible.\n</think>\n\nThe most likely reason for the absence of green (eGFP) fluorescence in the offspring is **D. the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Construct Design**:\n   - The bicistronic vector uses a **CBA promoter** for the ligand, followed by a **loxP-stop-loxP cassette** between the ligand and mCherry. \n   - The receptor is downstream of an **IRES element**, with a **lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette** between the receptor and eGFP.\n   - **Cre-mediated excision** of the stop codons should allow ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP expression in cells where SOX10-Cre is active (neural crest cells).\n\n2. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - In neural crest cells, Cre should remove the stops, enabling translation of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. The absence of green fluorescence suggests a failure in eGFP expression despite Cre activity.\n\n3. **Critical Issues**:\n   - **Option D (Frame Shift)**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame after Cre removes the stop, the eGFP sequence would be mistranslated, resulting in no functional GFP. This is plausible because:\n     - The Western blot confirmed construct functionality *in vitro*, implying correct design in the plasmid. However, genomic insertion during mouse breeding could introduce a frameshift mutation (e.g., cloning error or integration artifact).\n     - A frameshift would prevent eGFP expression regardless of Cre activity, directly explaining the lack of fluorescence.\n\n4. **Eliminating Other Options**:\n   - **A (Golgi retention)**: While transmembrane proteins can localize to the Golgi, eGFP fused to the receptor\u2019s C-terminus should still fluoresce intracellularly. The absence of *any* signal suggests no expression, not just mislocalization.\n   - **B (Paracrine relationship)**: Paracrine signaling affects ligand-receptor interaction, not eGFP expression. The eGFP tag should still be visible even if the ligand acts on distant cells.\n   - **C (Missing enhancer)**: The CBA promoter is constitutive and does not require enhancers for basic expression. The IRES ensures receptor translation even without ligand-driven transcription, so enhancer loss is unlikely to block eGFP entirely.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most parsimonious explanation is a frameshift between the receptor and eGFP, preventing proper translation of the fusion protein. This aligns with the observation that the construct worked *in vitro* (suggesting correct design in plasmids) but failed *in vivo*, pointing to a genomic integration or cloning error in the mouse model. \n\n**Answer: D. the receptor and the eGFP are not in frame.**",
