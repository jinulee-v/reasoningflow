        "question": "Your overhear two chemists talking to each other as they leave a synthetic organic chemistry lab. One asks the other \"So, how did it go?\" The second chemist replies, \"Not well - my compounds are on top of each other.\"\n\nWhat is the second chemist most likely referring to?\nA. The compounds they are working with have similar polarities.\nB. The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.\nC. The compounds they are working with are bonding to each other through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.\nD. The compounds they are working with have similar optical rotations.",
        "response": "The statement \"my compounds are on top of each other\" in the context of synthetic organic chemistry most likely refers to difficulties in separating or distinguishing between the compounds due to their similar properties. Among the given options, the one that best fits this scenario is:\n\nB. The compounds they are working with have similar boiling points.\n\nThis suggests that the chemist is having trouble with separation techniques such as distillation, where compounds with similar boiling points would not separate effectively, leading to a mixture where the compounds remain \"on top of each other\" rather than being separated into distinct layers or fractions."
