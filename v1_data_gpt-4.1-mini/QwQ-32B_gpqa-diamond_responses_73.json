        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the decay of an atomic nucleus. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about calculating the probability that a single atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay probability over 100 minutes is known to be 32%. The options are A through D with percentages. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how radioactive decay works. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential distribution, right? The probability of decay is constant over time, so the decay follows the formula N(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt), where \u03bb is the decay constant. But here, they mention a probability over a certain time, so maybe I can use that to find \u03bb first?\n\nLet me parse the problem again. The decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. That means if we start with a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed. Since we're dealing with a single atom, the probability that it decays within 100 minutes is 32%. \n\nSo, using the exponential decay formula, the probability of decay by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So, given that P(100) = 0.32, we can set up the equation:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*100)\n\nTherefore, e^(-\u03bb*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-\u03bb*100 = ln(0.68)\n\nSo, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100\n\nLet me compute that. Let me get my calculator out. Wait, maybe I can do this step by step.\n\nFirst, ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... since ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, so 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) should be a bit higher than -0.6931. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can remember that ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566? Wait, let me check with a calculator. Wait, actually, let me think. Let me recall that ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567, and ln(0.6) is about -0.5108. Since 0.68 is between 0.6 and 0.7, so maybe around -0.385? Let me see:\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68):\n\nLet me use the Taylor series approximation around 0.7? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, use natural logarithm properties. Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithm tables? Wait, maybe I can use a calculator here. Since this is a thought process, I can approximate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can just keep it symbolic for now. Let me see.\n\nSo, \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 (0.38566)/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute. Wait, actually, if ln(0.68) is negative, so the negative of that would be positive. Let me confirm with calculator steps:\n\nLet me compute ln(0.68):\n\nUsing a calculator (pretending to press buttons):\n\nln(0.68) \u2248 -0.385662489\n\nTherefore, \u03bb \u2248 0.385662489 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nSo, \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 min\u207b\u00b9.\n\nNow, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? Wait, so total time from now would be 150 minutes, but since it's already survived 50 minutes, the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But actually, since we are given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, we need to compute the conditional probability.\n\nWait, in radioactive decay, the probability is memoryless, right? So the probability of decaying in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how long it has already survived. Wait, but is that true?\n\nWait, actually, yes, the exponential distribution is memoryless. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability that it would decay in the first 150 minutes if it was just starting now. Wait, but actually, the memoryless property says that P(T > s + t | T > s) = P(T > t). So the probability that it survives another t minutes given it has survived s minutes is the same as the probability it survives t minutes from the start. Therefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - P(survive another 150 minutes) = 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150).\n\nWait, but hold on, let me confirm. The memoryless property says that the conditional probability of surviving an additional time t, given that it has already survived s, is equal to the probability of surviving t from the start. Therefore, the probability of decaying in the next t minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), regardless of how long it has already been around. Therefore, in this case, since we have to find the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes, it's the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from now. So, the 50 minutes already passed don't affect the probability for the next 150 minutes. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to compute the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes (since 50 + 150 = 200), given that it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes. So, the conditional probability would be [P(decay between 50 and 200)] / P(survived until 50). Since the decay is memoryless, this should be equal to P(decay between 0 and 150) / P(survived until 0), but since P(survived until 0) is 1, so it's just P(decay between 0 and 150). Wait, but actually, the conditional probability is P(50 < T \u2264 200 | T > 50) = P(T \u2264 200 and T >50)/P(T>50) = P(50 < T \u2264200)/P(T>50) = [P(T \u2264200) - P(T \u226450)] / P(T>50). \n\nBut since P(T \u2264 t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), so substituting:\n\n[ (1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)) - (1 - e^(-\u03bb*50)) ] / e^(-\u03bb*50)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n1 - e^(-200\u03bb) -1 + e^(-50\u03bb) = e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb)\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is [e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb)] / e^(-50\u03bb) ) = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb)\n\nAh, so that's the same as 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). So indeed, the memoryless property gives that the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now. Therefore, the 50 minutes already passed don't affect it. Therefore, the answer is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). \n\nTherefore, I can compute that. Let me compute \u03bb first. Earlier, we had \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute. Let me confirm that again.\n\nGiven that P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb), so e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68, so \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, to compute 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150):\n\nFirst compute \u03bb*150 = 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.57849\n\nThen e^(-0.57849) \u2248 ?\n\nAgain, let me compute e^-0.57849. Let me recall that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488, so 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute 0.57849. Let me use a calculator approach:\n\nLet me note that ln(0.55) is about -0.5978, so e^-0.5978 \u2248 0.55. Hmm, but maybe better to compute step by step.\n\nAlternatively, approximate e^-0.57849:\n\nLet me write 0.57849 as 0.5 + 0.07849.\n\nSo e^-(0.5 + 0.07849) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849 \u2248 0.6065 * e^-0.07849\n\nNow, e^-0.07849 \u2248 1 - 0.07849 + (0.07849)^2/2 - ... using Taylor series.\n\nFirst term: 1 - 0.07849 \u2248 0.92151\n\nSecond term: + (0.07849)^2 / 2 \u2248 (0.00616) / 2 \u2248 0.00308\n\nThird term: - (0.07849)^3 / 6 \u2248 (0.000483)/6 \u2248 0.0000805\n\nSo adding up: 0.92151 + 0.00308 \u2248 0.92459 - 0.00008 \u2248 0.92451\n\nSo e^-0.07849 \u2248 approximately 0.9245\n\nTherefore, e^-0.57849 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.6 * 0.9245 = 0.5547\n\n0.0065 * 0.9245 \u2248 0.006 * 0.9245 \u2248 0.00555, plus 0.0005*0.9245\u22480.00046, so total \u22480.00601\n\nSo total \u2248 0.5547 + 0.00601 \u2248 0.5607\n\nTherefore, e^-0.57849 \u2248 ~0.5607, so 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, so approximately 43.93%, which is about 44%. Hmm, so that would be answer B, 44%.\n\nWait, but let me check with a calculator for better precision. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute \u03bb more accurately.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u03bb again:\n\nGiven that e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68, so \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100\n\nCalculating ln(0.68):\n\nUsing a calculator (pretend):\n\nln(0.68) = ?\n\nLet me recall that ln(0.68) = ln(68/100) = ln(68) - ln(100) = ln(68) - 4.60517\n\nln(68): ln(64) is 4.1589, ln(68) is a bit more. Let's compute ln(68):\n\n68 = 64 * 1.0625, so ln(68) = ln(64) + ln(1.0625) \u2248 4.1589 + 0.06062 \u2248 4.2195\n\nTherefore, ln(68) \u2248 4.2195, so ln(0.68) \u2248 4.2195 - 4.60517 \u2248 -0.38567\n\nTherefore, \u03bb = 0.38567 / 100 \u2248 0.0038567 per minute.\n\nSo, \u03bb*150 = 0.0038567 * 150 = 0.578505\n\nTherefore, e^-0.578505. Let me compute this more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, using the fact that e^-0.5785 \u2248 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that ln(0.56) is?\n\nWait, maybe better to use a calculator-like approach:\n\nLet me note that e^-0.5785 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me use the Taylor series expansion around x=0.5:\n\nWait, maybe better to use known values. Let me see:\n\nWe know that e^-0.5 \u2248 0.6065\n\ne^-0.6 \u2248 0.5488\n\nWe need e^-0.5785. Let me see the difference between 0.5 and 0.5785 is 0.0785, so between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.\n\nLet me use linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.\n\nAt x=0.5, e^-x = 0.6065\n\nAt x=0.6, e^-x = 0.5488\n\nThe difference between x=0.5 and x=0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the difference in e^-x is 0.5488 - 0.6065 = -0.0577\n\nSo, per 0.1 x, the decrease is -0.0577. So per 0.01 x, decrease is -0.00577.\n\nWe need to go from x=0.5 to x=0.5785, which is an increase of 0.0785 in x.\n\nTherefore, the decrease in e^-x would be 0.0785 * (0.0577 / 0.1) \u2248 0.0785 * 0.577 \u2248 0.0453\n\nTherefore, e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.6065 - 0.0453 \u2248 0.5612\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.5612 \u2248 0.4388, so ~43.88%, which is about 44%, so answer B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a better approximation. Let me try using the Taylor series around x=0.5:\n\nLet me let f(x) = e^{-x}, and expand around a=0.5.\n\nf(a) = e^{-0.5} \u2248 0.6065\n\nf'(a) = -e^{-0.5} \u2248 -0.6065\n\nf''(a) = e^{-0.5} \u2248 0.6065\n\nWait, but maybe linear approximation is sufficient here.\n\nWait, let me compute f(0.5785) \u2248 f(0.5) + f\u2019(0.5)*(0.5785 - 0.5)\n\nSo, f(0.5785) \u2248 0.6065 + (-0.6065)*(0.0785)\n\nCompute 0.6065 * 0.0785 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.07 = 0.042455, plus 0.6065 *0.0085\u22480.005155, total \u22480.04761\n\nTherefore, f(0.5785) \u2248 0.6065 - 0.0476 \u2248 0.5589\n\nWait, that's different from the previous linear between 0.5 and 0.6. Hmm, so which is better?\n\nWait, the linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6 gave 0.5612, while the Taylor series around 0.5 gives 0.5589. Hmm, so maybe the actual value is around 0.56?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator here. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, since I know that ln(0.56) is?\n\nWait, let me think of e^-0.5785 = ?\n\nLet me note that 0.5785 is approximately 0.5785.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that ln(0.56) \u2248 ?\n\nWait, maybe I can use logarithm tables? Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that e^-0.5785 \u2248 1 / e^0.5785.\n\nCompute e^0.5785:\n\nWe can compute e^0.5 = 1.64872\n\ne^0.0785 \u2248 1 + 0.0785 + (0.0785)^2/2 + (0.0785)^3/6\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: 0.0785\n\nThird term: (0.00616)/2 \u2248 0.00308\n\nFourth term: (0.000483)/6 \u2248 0.0000805\n\nAdding up: 1 + 0.0785 = 1.0785 + 0.00308 = 1.08158 + 0.00008 \u2248 1.08166\n\nTherefore, e^0.0785 \u2248 1.08166\n\nTherefore, e^0.5785 = e^0.5 * e^0.0785 \u2248 1.64872 * 1.08166 \u2248 ?\n\nCompute 1.64872 * 1.08:\n\n1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872\n\n1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1319\n\nTotal \u2248 1.64872 + 0.1319 \u2248 1.7806\n\nThen, 1.64872 * 1.08166 \u2248 1.7806 + (1.64872 * 0.00166) \u2248 1.7806 + 0.00273 \u2248 1.7833\n\nTherefore, e^0.5785 \u2248 1.7833, so e^-0.5785 \u2248 1 / 1.7833 \u2248 0.5606\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.5606 \u2248 0.4394, so ~43.94%, which is about 44%. So that's consistent with the previous calculation. So the answer is B, 44%.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Let me recap:\n\nWe have a decay probability of 32% in 100 minutes. So, the survival probability after 100 minutes is 68%, so e^(-\u03bb*100)=0.68, so \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nThen, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). Since the memoryless property allows us to ignore the prior 50 minutes.\n\nCalculating that exponent: 0.0038566 * 150 \u2248 0.5785, so e^-0.5785 \u2248 0.5606, so 1 - 0.5606 \u2248 0.4394, so ~44%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, 44%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different approach? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want to compute the probability over 200 minutes minus the probability over 50 minutes? Wait, but that would be incorrect because the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is P(decay between 50 and 200) = P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50). But since we are given that it hasn't decayed by 50, the conditional probability is [P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50)] / P(not decay by 50). Which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the half-life formula? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want to use the fact that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the half-life can be calculated?\n\nWait, but the half-life T1/2 is related to \u03bb by T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb. But maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the answer is different if I model it as a binomial distribution? But no, since it's a continuous process, exponential is the right model.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Since 50 minutes have passed, and the total time we are looking at is 150 minutes, so total time from start would be 200 minutes. But the probability of decay in 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bb*200). But since we know it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the conditional probability is [1 - e^(-\u03bb*200)] / e^(-\u03bb*50) - 1? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the conditional probability is [P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50)] / P(survived 50). Which is exactly the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the numbers again step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb:\n\nGiven that after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed, so survival probability S(100) = 0.68 = e^(-\u03bb*100). So \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nCompute the survival probability after 50 minutes: S(50) = e^(-\u03bb*50) \u2248 e^(-0.0038566*50) \u2248 e^(-0.19283) \u2248 ?\n\nCompute e^-0.19283:\n\nAgain, e^-0.2 \u2248 0.8187, so 0.19283 is slightly less than 0.2, so e^-0.19283 \u2248 0.824?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLet me compute 0.19283. Let me use the Taylor series again.\n\ne^-0.19283 \u2248 1 - 0.19283 + (0.19283)^2 / 2 - (0.19283)^3 / 6\n\nFirst term: 1 - 0.19283 = 0.80717\n\nSecond term: + (0.03718)/2 \u2248 0.01859 \u2192 0.80717 + 0.01859 \u2248 0.82576\n\nThird term: - (0.00717)/6 \u2248 -0.001195 \u2192 0.82576 - 0.001195 \u2248 0.82456\n\nFourth term: + (0.00138)/24 \u2248 negligible.\n\nSo approximately 0.8246. So S(50) \u2248 0.8246.\n\nThen, the survival probability after 200 minutes is S(200) = e^(-\u03bb*200) \u2248 e^(-0.0038566*200) = e^(-0.77132). Let me compute that:\n\ne^-0.77132. Let me see:\n\nWe know that e^-0.7 \u2248 0.4966, e^-0.8 \u2248 0.4493. 0.77132 is between 0.7 and 0.8.\n\nCompute e^-0.77132:\n\nLet me use linear approximation between 0.7 and 0.8.\n\nAt x=0.7, e^-x \u22480.4966\n\nAt x=0.8, e^-x\u22480.4493\n\nDifference over 0.1 x is -0.0473 per 0.1 x.\n\n0.77132 -0.7 = 0.07132, so fraction is 0.7132 of the interval from 0.7 to 0.8.\n\nWait, actually, the difference between 0.7 and 0.8 is 0.1, so 0.07132 is 0.7132 of that interval. Wait, no, actually, the fraction is 0.07132 / 0.1 = 0.7132.\n\nTherefore, the decrease from 0.4966 would be 0.7132 * (-0.0473) \u2248 -0.0337\n\nTherefore, e^-0.77132 \u2248 0.4966 - 0.0337 \u2248 0.4629\n\nAlternatively, using Taylor series around x=0.7:\n\nLet me compute f(x)=e^{-x}, at x=0.7, f=0.4966\n\nf'(x)= -e^{-x}, so f'(0.7)= -0.4966\n\nf''(x)= e^{-x}, so f''(0.7)=0.4966\n\nApproximate f(0.77132) \u2248 f(0.7) + f\u2019(0.7)*(0.07132) + 0.5*f''(0.7)*(0.07132)^2\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term: 0.4966\n\nSecond term: -0.4966 * 0.07132 \u2248 -0.03546\n\nThird term: 0.5 * 0.4966 * (0.005086) \u2248 0.5 * 0.4966 * 0.005086 \u2248 0.00127\n\nTotal \u2248 0.4966 -0.03546 +0.00127 \u2248 0.4624\n\nSo, e^-0.77132 \u2248 ~0.4624\n\nTherefore, the survival probability after 200 minutes is ~0.4624.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it has decayed between 50 and 200 minutes is S(50) - S(200) = 0.8246 - 0.4624 \u2248 0.3622. But wait, no, actually, the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is P(decay between 50 and 200) = S(50) - S(200). Wait, actually, the survival probability at 200 is S(200), so the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is S(50) - S(200). Therefore, the conditional probability is [S(50) - S(200)] / S(50) = 1 - S(200)/S(50)\n\nCompute S(200)/S(50) = e^(-\u03bb*200)/e^(-\u03bb*50) = e^(-\u03bb*(200-50)) = e^(-\u03bb*150). So that's the same as before. Therefore, 1 - e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 1 - 0.5606 \u2248 0.4394, so 43.94%, so 44%.\n\nTherefore, that's consistent. So the answer is B, 44%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem interpretation? Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes\". So that is P(decay within 100 minutes) = 0.32. So that is correct.\n\nThen, \"50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\"\n\nSo the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes, so total 200 minutes from start, but conditional on surviving 50 minutes. So yes, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to use a different model, like a constant probability per unit time, but that's essentially what the exponential model is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the fact that the decay probability over 100 minutes is 32%, so the probability per minute is 0.32/100 = 0.32% per minute, and then over 150 minutes, it's 0.32% * 150 = 48%, but that would be linear, which is incorrect because decay is exponential, not linear. So that would be answer A, 48%, but that's wrong because the decay is memoryless and exponential.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to compute the probability as 1 - (survival probability over 150 minutes). But survival probability over 150 minutes is e^(-\u03bb*150) \u2248 0.5606, so 1 - 0.5606 \u2248 0.4394, so 44%, which is B. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they consider that after 50 minutes, the remaining probability is 1 - (0.32 * 0.5) or something? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the decay probability is given. Let me check the problem again:\n\n\"We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\"\n\nSo that is P(T \u2264 100) = 0.32, so that is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct, so the answer is B, 44%.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the half-life.\n\nGiven that P(T \u2264 100) = 0.32, so the half-life T1/2 is the time when P(T \u2264 T1/2) = 0.5.\n\nWe can compute T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb.\n\nWe have \u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nTherefore, T1/2 \u2248 0.6931 / 0.0038566 \u2248 let's compute that:\n\n0.6931 / 0.0038566 \u2248 0.6931 / 0.0038566 \u2248 179.7 minutes.\n\nSo the half-life is approximately 180 minutes.\n\nTherefore, in 100 minutes, which is less than a half-life, the decay probability is 32%, which is less than 50%, which makes sense.\n\nNow, the question is, after 50 minutes, what is the probability to decay in the next 150 minutes (total 200 minutes from start). Since the half-life is ~180 minutes, so after 200 minutes, which is a bit more than a half-life, the survival probability would be roughly 0.5 * e^(- (200 - 180)/180 * ln2 ), but maybe that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, using the half-life formula:\n\nThe decay probability in time t is 1 - (1/2)^(t / T1/2)\n\nWait, but that formula is an approximation for discrete half-lives, but actually, the exact formula is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt), and since T1/2 = ln(2)/\u03bb, so substituting, 1 - e^(- (ln2 / T1/2)* t ) = 1 - 2^(-t / T1/2). So that's exact.\n\nTherefore, using that formula, let's compute the probability of decaying in 150 minutes:\n\nP = 1 - 2^(-150 / 179.7)\n\nCompute 150 / 179.7 \u2248 0.835\n\nTherefore, 2^-0.835 \u2248 ?\n\nSince 2^-0.835 = e^(-0.835 ln2) \u2248 e^(-0.835 * 0.6931) \u2248 e^(-0.579)\n\nWait, that's exactly the exponent we had before, 0.579, so e^-0.579 \u2248 0.5606, so 1 - 0.5606 \u2248 0.4394, so same result. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 44%, which is B.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B, 44%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem of determining the probability that a single atom will decay in the next 150 minutes after already surviving 50 minutes, we start by using the exponential decay model. The decay probability within 100 minutes is given as 32%, which allows us to find the decay constant \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n1. **Calculate the decay constant \\(\\lambda\\):**\n   \\[\n   P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(\\lambda\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} = 0.68 \\implies -\\lambda \\cdot 100 = \\ln(0.68) \\implies \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\lambda \\approx \\frac{0.38566}{100} \\approx 0.0038566 \\, \\text{per minute}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes using the memoryless property:**\n   The probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given it has survived 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from the start:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{decay in next 150 minutes}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150}\n   \\]\n   Calculate the exponent:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.0038566 \\cdot 150 \\approx 0.5785\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   e^{-0.5785} \\approx 0.5606\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the probability is:\n   \\[\n   1 - 0.5606 \\approx 0.4394 \\approx 44\\%\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verification using half-life approach:**\n   The half-life \\(T_{1/2}\\) is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   T_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda} \\approx \\frac{0.6931}{0.0038566} \\approx 179.7 \\, \\text{minutes}\n   \\]\n   Using the half-life formula for decay probability:\n   \\[\n   P = 1 - 2^{-150 / 179.7} \\approx 1 - 2^{-0.835} \\approx 1 - 0.5606 \\approx 0.4394 \\approx 44\\%\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is \\(\\boxed{B}\\)."
