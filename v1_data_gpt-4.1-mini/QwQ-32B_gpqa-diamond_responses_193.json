        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the partition function Z for this system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1, and the energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). The partition function is the sum over all possible states of e^{-\u03b2E}, right? Since \u03b2 is 1/(kT), but I can just keep it as \u03b2 for now.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the partition function Z is calculated by summing e^{-\u03b2E} for all possible configurations of the spins. Since each spin has two possible states, there are 2^3 = 8 total configurations. So I need to list all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3, compute the energy for each, then compute e^{-\u03b2E} for each, and add them all up.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 terms? Let me see. The energy is a sum of products of pairs. Let me think if there's a way to factor this or find symmetries. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to just go through each case. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, list all possible spin configurations. Each spin can be +1 or -1. Let me denote them as follows:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nNow, for each of these, compute E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nStarting with configuration 1: all spins +1.\n\nCompute S1S2 = (+1)(+1) = +1\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(+1) = +1\n\nSum: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nSo E = -J*(3) = -3J\n\nTherefore, the Boltzmann factor is e^{-\u03b2E} = e^{-\u03b2*(-3J)} = e^{3\u03b2J}\n\nOkay, that's the first term.\n\nConfiguration 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\nCompute S1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1)=-1\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(-1)=-1\n\nSum: 1 -1 -1 = -1\n\nThus, E = -J*(-1) = +J\n\nBoltzmann factor: e^{-\u03b2*(J)} = e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nConfiguration 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(+1)=1\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1\n\nE = -J*(-1) = +J\n\nSame as configuration 2. So Boltzmann factor e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nConfiguration 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nCompute terms:\n\nS1S2 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nS1S3 = (+1)(-1) = -1\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 = -1\n\nE = -J*(-1) = +J\n\nSame as before. So Boltzmann factor e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nConfiguration 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(+1)=+1\n\nSum: -1 -1 +1 = -1\n\nE = -J*(-1) = +J\n\nAgain, same as previous three. So Boltzmann factor e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nConfiguration 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\nCompute terms:\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1\n\nS2S3 = (+1)(-1)=-1\n\nSum: -1 +1 -1 = -1\n\nE = -J*(-1) = +J\n\nSame as before. Boltzmann factor e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nConfiguration 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=+1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1\n\nSum: 1 -1 -1 = -1\n\nE = -J*(-1) = +J\n\nSame again. Boltzmann factor e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nConfiguration 8: All spins -1.\n\nS1S2 = (-1)(-1)=+1\n\nS1S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1\n\nS2S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1\n\nSum: 1 +1 +1 = 3\n\nE = -J*(3) = -3J\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the energy is -J*(sum). So if the sum is 3, then E = -3J. Wait, but in configuration 1, the energy was -3J, and here, configuration 8, the sum is also 3, so E is also -3J? Wait, but that would mean that configuration 8 has energy -3J, so the Boltzmann factor would be e^{3\u03b2J} as well. Wait, but in configuration 8, all spins are -1, so their products are all +1, so the sum is 3, so E is -3J. So yes, same as configuration 1. So configuration 8 also has e^{3\u03b2J}\n\nWait, so let me recap:\n\nConfiguration 1: e^{3\u03b2J}\n\nConfigurations 2-7: each has e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nConfiguration 8: e^{3\u03b2J}\n\nWait, but how many configurations have energy -3J? Just configurations 1 and 8? Let me check again.\n\nYes, configuration 1: all +1, so each product is +1, sum 3, so E = -3J.\n\nConfiguration 8: all -1, each product is also +1 (since (-1)(-1)=+1), so sum is 3, so E = -3J. So those two configurations have energy -3J, so their contribution is 2*e^{3\u03b2J}\n\nThen the other 6 configurations (2-7) each have energy +J, so their contribution is 6*e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nTherefore, the total partition function Z is 2*e^{3\u03b2J} + 6*e^{-\u03b2J}\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\nOption B is Z=2 e^{3J\u03b2}+6e^{-J\u03b2}\n\nYes, that's exactly what I got. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure. Let me recount the energies.\n\nStarting with configuration 2: S3 is -1. The products:\n\nS1S2 is +1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1)=+J. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, configuration 3: S2 is -1, S3 is +1. The products:\n\nS1S2 is -1, S1S3 is +1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. Correct.\n\nConfiguration 4: S2 and S3 are -1. Products:\n\nS1S2 is -1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is +1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Correct.\n\nConfiguration 5: S1 is -1, others +1. Products:\n\nS1S2 is -1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is +1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. Correct.\n\nConfiguration 6: S1 and S3 are -1. Products:\n\nS1S2 is -1, S1S3 is +1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. Correct.\n\nConfiguration 7: S2 and S3 are -1? Wait, no, configuration 7 is S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. So:\n\nS1S2 is +1, S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct.\n\nConfiguration 8: all -1, so products all +1, sum 3, so E=-3J. Correct.\n\nSo indeed, only two configurations have energy -3J, and the other six have energy +J. Therefore, the partition function is 2e^{3\u03b2J} +6e^{-\u03b2J}, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again to make sure I didn't misread.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Z= 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nB. Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nC. Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nD. Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nYes, so B is exactly what I have. So the answer is B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the energy calculation? Let me check one of the middle configurations again. Let's take configuration 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.\n\nThe energy is -J*(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J*(1 + (-1) + (-1)) = -J*(-1) = +J. Correct.\n\nAnother check: configuration 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.\n\nEnergy: -J*[ (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) ] = -J*[ -1 -1 +1 ] = -J*(-1) = +J. Correct.\n\nSo all the non-extreme configurations (not all +1 or all -1) have energy +J. There are 6 of them, so 6 terms of e^{-\u03b2J}, and two terms of e^{3\u03b2J}. So yes, B is correct.\n\nHmm, but let me think again if there's another way to compute this without enumerating all possibilities. Maybe using some symmetry or factorization?\n\nThe energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me see if I can rewrite this expression. Maybe express it in terms of (S1 + S2 + S3)^2?\n\nWait, (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i is \u00b11, S_i^2 =1, so the sum of squares is 3. Therefore,\n\n(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3)\n\nTherefore, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2\n\nTherefore, the energy E = -J * [ ( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ) / 2 ]\n\nSo E = - (J/2)( (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 )\n\nTherefore, E = - (J/2)(S1 + S2 + S3)^2 + 3J/2\n\nHmm, so the energy can be written in terms of the square of the total spin. Let me denote M = S1 + S2 + S3. Then,\n\nE = - (J/2) M^2 + 3J/2\n\nTherefore, the exponent in the partition function is -\u03b2E = \u03b2*( (J/2) M^2 - 3J/2 )\n\nSo the partition function Z = sum_{all states} e^{ \u03b2*( (J/2) M^2 - 3J/2 ) } = e^{- 3J\u03b2/2 } sum_{all states} e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2) M^2 }\n\nTherefore, Z = e^{- 3J\u03b2/2 } * sum_{M} (number of states with total spin M) * e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2) M^2 }\n\nSo now, we can compute the possible values of M and their degeneracies.\n\nWhat are the possible values of M = S1 + S2 + S3?\n\nEach S_i is \u00b11, so the total M can be:\n\n-3 (all -1),\n\n-1 (two -1, one +1),\n\n+1 (two +1, one -1),\n\n+3 (all +1).\n\nSo possible M values: -3, -1, +1, +3.\n\nNow, let's find the number of states for each M:\n\n- M = +3: all spins +1. Only 1 state.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw two states with energy -3J, which correspond to M=+3 and M=-3. Wait, actually, M=+3 is all +1, M=-3 is all -1. Each has 1 state. Wait, but in the previous calculation, configurations 1 and 8 (all +1 and all -1) each have energy -3J, so they correspond to M=+3 and M=-3. Wait, but according to the energy expression above, E = - (J/2) M^2 + 3J/2. Let me check for M=+3:\n\nE = - (J/2)(9) + 3J/2 = -9J/2 + 3J/2 = -6J/2 = -3J. Correct.\n\nFor M=-3, same because M^2 is same, so E is also -3J. So both M=+3 and M=-3 give E=-3J. So each of those has 1 state, so total 2 states with energy -3J. That matches.\n\nNow for M=+1: two +1 and one -1. The number of such states is C(3,1)=3 (choosing which spin is -1). Similarly, M=-1: two -1 and one +1, also 3 states. Each of these would have M^2 =1, so let's see their energy.\n\nFor M=+1 or -1, M^2 =1, so E = - (J/2)(1) + 3J/2 = (-J/2 + 3J/2) = (2J)/2 = J. So each of these states has energy +J. The number of states with M=+1 is 3, and M=-1 is 3, so total 6 states with energy +J. That matches the previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the degeneracies are:\n\nM=+3: 1 state,\n\nM=-3: 1 state,\n\nM=+1: 3 states,\n\nM=-1: 3 states.\n\nTherefore, the partition function can be written as:\n\nZ = e^{-3J\u03b2/2} [ (1 + 1) e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2)(9) } + (3 + 3) e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2)(1) } ]\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, the sum over all states is equivalent to summing over M, multiplying the number of states with each M by e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2) M^2 }.\n\nSo:\n\nZ = e^{-3J\u03b2/2} [ (number of M=+3 states)*e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2)(+3)^2 } + (number of M=-3 states)*e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2)(-3)^2 } + (number of M=+1 states)*e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2)(+1)^2 } + (number of M=-1 states)*e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2)(-1)^2 } ]\n\nBut since M^2 is same for +3 and -3, and same for +1 and -1, so:\n\nZ = e^{-3J\u03b2/2} [ (1 + 1)*e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2)(9) } + (3 + 3)*e^{ (\u03b2 J / 2)(1) } ]\n\nCalculating exponents:\n\nFor M=\u00b13: exponent is (\u03b2 J / 2)*9 = (9/2) \u03b2 J\n\nFor M=\u00b11: exponent is (\u03b2 J / 2)*1 = (1/2) \u03b2 J\n\nTherefore,\n\nZ = e^{-3J\u03b2/2} [ 2 e^{ (9/2) \u03b2 J } + 6 e^{ (1/2) \u03b2 J } ]\n\nSimplify exponents:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets: 2 e^{ (9/2) \u03b2 J } multiplied by e^{-3J\u03b2/2} gives 2 e^{ (9/2 - 3/2) \u03b2 J } = 2 e^{ 3 \u03b2 J }\n\nSecond term: 6 e^{ (1/2) \u03b2 J } multiplied by e^{-3J\u03b2/2} gives 6 e^{ (1/2 - 3/2) \u03b2 J } = 6 e^{ - \u03b2 J }\n\nTherefore, Z = 2 e^{3 \u03b2 J} + 6 e^{- \u03b2 J }, which is exactly option B. So that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered both enumerating all states and using the total spin approach, and both lead to the same result. So I'm confident that B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>\n\nTo find the partition function \\( Z \\) for a system of three spins \\( S_1, S_2, \\) and \\( S_3 \\) with energy \\( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \\), we need to consider all possible configurations of the spins and their corresponding energies.\n\nEach spin can be either +1 or -1, leading to \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) configurations.
