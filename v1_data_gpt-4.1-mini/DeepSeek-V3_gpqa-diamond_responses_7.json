        "question": "You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function \u2013 G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? \nAfter tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control\u2019s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control\u2019s resistance; 0% \u2012 all plants show signs of infection:\n- resistance of g1: 75% of control\n- resistance of g2: 0% from control\n- resistance of g3: 50% from control\n-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control\n- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control\n- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control\n\nWhich conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?\nA. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nB. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1\nC. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3\nD. G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1",
        "response": "To determine the correct conclusion, let's analyze the results step by step:\n\n1. **Resistance Levels of Single Mutants:**\n   - **g1:** 75% resistance \u2192 G1 contributes to resistance but is not essential.\n   - **g2:** 0% resistance \u2192 G2 is essential for resistance; its loss completely abolishes resistance.\n   - **g3:** 50% resistance \u2192 G3 contributes significantly to resistance but is not as critical as G2.\n\n2. **Resistance Levels of Double Mutants:**\n   - **g1g3:** 10% resistance \u2192 The combined loss of G1 and G3 drastically reduces resistance, suggesting they have overlapping or complementary roles.\n   - **g2g3:** 0% resistance \u2192 G2 is epistatic to G3; loss of G2 completely abolishes resistance regardless of G3.\n   - **g1g2:** 0% resistance \u2192 G2 is epistatic to G1; loss of G2 completely abolishes resistance regardless of G1.\n\n3. **Interpretation:**\n   - **G2** is essential for resistance, and its loss completely abolishes resistance, indicating it likely acts upstream as a transcription factor regulating other genes (G1 and G3).\n   - **G1 and G3** show **gene redundancy** because the loss of both (g1g3) drastically reduces resistance, but the loss of either alone (g1 or g3) only partially reduces resistance.\n   - **G1 is epistatic towards G3** because the resistance level of g1g3 (10%) is closer to the resistance level of g1 (75%) than to g3 (50%).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The correct interpretation aligns with **Option A**:\n   - **G2 is a transcription factor**, **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**, and **G1 is epistatic towards G3**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n**A. G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3**."
