        "question": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",
        "response": "Alright, I have this problem about a tetrahedron \\( ABCD \\) with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a special point \\( I \\) inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. The distance is supposed to be equal to all faces and can be expressed in the form \\( \\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p} \\). Finally, I need to find \\( m + n + p \\).\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information:\n\n- \\( AB = CD = \\sqrt{41} \\)\n- \\( AC = BD = \\sqrt{80} \\)\n- \\( BC = AD = \\sqrt{89} \\)\n\nThere's a point \\( I \\) inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from \\( I \\) to each of the four faces are equal. This point \\( I \\) is likely the incenter of the tetrahedron, analogous to the incenter of a triangle, which is equidistant from all sides.\n\nThe distance from \\( I \\) to each face is the inradius of the tetrahedron. So, I need to find the inradius \\( r \\) of tetrahedron \\( ABCD \\).\n\nTo find the inradius, I recall that for a tetrahedron, the inradius \\( r \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( V \\) is the volume of the tetrahedron, and \\( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 \\) are the areas of the four faces.\n\nSo, my task reduces to finding the volume \\( V \\) and the sum of the areas of the four faces.\n\nBut first, I need to find the coordinates or some other properties of the tetrahedron to compute these values. Given the edge lengths, perhaps I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to simplify calculations.\n\nLet's try assigning coordinates to the vertices:\n\nLet\u2019s place point \\( A \\) at the origin, so \\( A = (0, 0, 0) \\).\n\nLet\u2019s place point \\( B \\) along the x-axis, so \\( B = (b, 0, 0) \\).\n\nPoint \\( C \\) will be in the xy-plane, so \\( C = (c_x, c_y, 0) \\).\n\nPoint \\( D \\) will have coordinates \\( D = (d_x, d_y, d_z) \\).\n\nNow, I can use the given edge lengths to set up equations:\n\n1. \\( AB = \\sqrt{41} \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(b - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{41} \\implies b = \\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\n2. \\( AC = \\sqrt{80} \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(c_x - 0)^2 + (c_y - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{80} \\implies c_x^2 + c_y^2 = 80\n\\]\n\n3. \\( BC = \\sqrt{89} \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(c_x - b)^2 + (c_y - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{89} \\implies (c_x - \\sqrt{41})^2 + c_y^2 = 89\n\\]\n\nFrom equations 2 and 3:\n\n\\[\nc_x^2 + c_y^2 = 80\n\\]\n\\[\n(c_x - \\sqrt{41})^2 + c_y^2 = 89\n\\]\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[\n(c_x - \\sqrt{41})^2 - c_x^2 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\nc_x^2 - 2c_x\\sqrt{41} + 41 - c_x^2 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n-2c_x\\sqrt{41} + 41 = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n-2c_x\\sqrt{41} = -32\n\\]\n\\[\nc_x = \\frac{32}{2\\sqrt{41}} = \\frac{16}{\\sqrt{41}}\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( c_x \\) back into equation 2 to find \\( c_y \\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{16}{\\sqrt{41}}\\right)^2 + c_y^2 = 80\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{256}{41} + c_y^2 = 80\n\\]\n\\[\nc_y^2 = 80 - \\frac{256}{41} = \\frac{3280 - 256}{41} = \\frac{3024}{41}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3024}}{\\sqrt{41}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16 \\times 189}}{\\sqrt{41}} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{189}}{\\sqrt{41}}\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\sqrt{189} \\):\n\n\\[\n189 = 9 \\times 21 = 9 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\implies \\sqrt{189} = 3\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_y = \\frac{4 \\times 3\\sqrt{21}}{\\sqrt{41}} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{21}}{\\sqrt{41}}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of point \\( D \\). We have:\n\n4. \\( AD = \\sqrt{89} \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(d_x - 0)^2 + (d_y - 0)^2 + (d_z - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{89} \\implies d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2 = 89\n\\]\n\n5. \\( BD = \\sqrt{80} \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(d_x - b)^2 + (d_y - 0)^2 + (d_z - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{80} \\implies (d_x - \\sqrt{41})^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2 = 80\n\\]\n\n6. \\( CD = \\sqrt{41} \\):\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(d_x - c_x)^2 + (d_y - c_y)^2 + (d_z - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{41} \\implies (d_x - \\frac{16}{\\sqrt{41}})^2 + (d_y - \\frac{12\\sqrt{21}}{\\sqrt{41}})^2 + d_z^2 = 41\n\\]\n\nThis seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use vector geometry or the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume directly.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant is a formula to compute the volume of a tetrahedron given its edge lengths. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n288 V^2 = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\\\\n1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\\\\n1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\\\\n1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nGiven the edge lengths:\n\n- \\( AB = \\sqrt{41} \\implies AB^2 = 41 \\)\n- \\( AC = \\sqrt{80} \\implies AC^2 = 80 \\)\n- \\( AD = \\sqrt{89} \\implies AD^2 = 89 \\)\n- \\( BC = \\sqrt{89} \\implies BC^2 = 89 \\)\n- \\( BD = \\sqrt{80} \\implies BD^2 = 80 \\)\n- \\( CD = \\sqrt{41} \\implies CD^2 = 41 \\)\n\nPlugging these into the determinant:\n\n\\[\n288 V^2 = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 41 & 80 & 89 \\\\\n1 & 41 & 0 & 89 & 80 \\\\\n1 & 80 & 89 & 0 & 41 \\\\\n1 & 89 & 80 & 41 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this determinant seems tedious, but perhaps there's a pattern or simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is isoedral (all faces are congruent) or has some symmetry, but the given edge lengths don't immediately suggest that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is equifacial, meaning all faces have the same area. But the edge lengths given don't guarantee that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use vector methods.\n\nLet me try assigning vectors:\n\nLet\u2019s set \\( \\vec{A} = \\vec{0} \\), \\( \\vec{B} = \\vec{b} \\), \\( \\vec{C} = \\vec{c} \\), \\( \\vec{D} = \\vec{d} \\).\n\nGiven:\n\n1. \\( |\\vec{b}| = \\sqrt{41} \\)\n2. \\( |\\vec{c}| = \\sqrt{80} \\)\n3. \\( |\\vec{d}| = \\sqrt{89} \\)\n4. \\( |\\vec{b} - \\vec{c}| = \\sqrt{89} \\)\n5. \\( |\\vec{b} - \\vec{d}| = \\sqrt{80} \\)\n6. \\( |\\vec{c} - \\vec{d}| = \\sqrt{41} \\)\n\nThis seems similar to the coordinate approach but perhaps more abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the inradius \\( r \\) is related to the volume \\( V \\) and the total surface area \\( S \\) by:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{S}\n\\]\n\nSo, I need to find \\( V \\) and \\( S \\).\n\nGiven the complexity of directly computing \\( V \\) and \\( S \\) from the edge lengths, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is isoedral, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is equifacial, but again, the edge lengths don't suggest that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is orthocentric, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is isogonal, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the
