        "response": "Alright, I have this probability problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nJen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \\( S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 9, 10\\} \\). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \\( S \\). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. We need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The probability is given in the form \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are relatively prime positive integers, and we need to find \\( m + n \\).\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We need to find the conditional probability that Jen wins the grand prize (all four numbers match) given that she has already won a prize (at least two numbers match). In probability terms, this is \\( P(\\text{Grand Prize} \\mid \\text{Prize}) \\).\n\n**Approach:**\n\nTo find this conditional probability, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Grand Prize} \\mid \\text{Prize}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Grand Prize})}{P(\\text{Prize})}\n\\]\n\nSo, we need to find two probabilities:\n\n1. \\( P(\\text{Grand Prize}) \\): The probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the randomly chosen numbers.\n2. \\( P(\\text{Prize}) \\): The probability that at least two of Jen's numbers match the randomly chosen numbers.\n\n**Calculating \\( P(\\text{Grand Prize}) \\):**\n\nFirst, let's find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, i.e., all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers.\n\n- Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10: \\( \\binom{10}{4} \\).\n- Number of favorable outcomes where Jen's 4 numbers match the randomly chosen 4 numbers: 1.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Grand Prize}) = \\frac{1}{\\binom{10}{4}} = \\frac{1}{210}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating \\( P(\\text{Prize}) \\):**\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that Jen wins a prize, which means at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers.\n\nIt's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1. The complementary event is that fewer than two of her numbers match, i.e., zero or one match.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Prize}) = 1 - P(\\text{Zero matches}) - P(\\text{One match})\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate \\( P(\\text{Zero matches}) \\) and \\( P(\\text{One match}) \\).\n\n1. **Zero Matches:**\n\n   - Number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 numbers that Jen did not pick: \\( \\binom{6}{4} \\).\n   - Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10: \\( \\binom{10}{4} \\).\n\n   So,\n\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Zero matches}) = \\frac{\\binom{6}{4}}{\\binom{10}{4}} = \\frac{15}{210} = \\frac{1}{14}\n   \\]\n\n2. **One Match:**\n\n   - Number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 numbers: \\( \\binom{4}{1} \\).\n   - Number of ways to choose 3 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers: \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\).\n   - Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10: \\( \\binom{10}{4} \\).\n\n   So,\n\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{One match}) = \\frac{\\binom{4}{1} \\times \\binom{6}{3}}{\\binom{10}{4}} = \\frac{4 \\times 20}{210} = \\frac{80}{210} = \\frac{8}{21}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( P(\\text{Prize}) \\):\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Prize}) = 1 - P(\\text{Zero matches}) - P(\\text{One match}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{14} - \\frac{8}{21}\n\\]\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 14 and 21 is 42.\n\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{42}{42}, \\quad \\frac{1}{14} = \\frac{3}{42}, \\quad \\frac{8}{21} = \\frac{16}{42}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Prize}) = \\frac{42}{42} - \\frac{3}{42} - \\frac{16}{42} = \\frac{23}{42}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the Conditional Probability:**\n\nNow, we can find the conditional probability:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Grand Prize} \\mid \\text{Prize}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Grand Prize})}{P(\\text{Prize})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{210}}{\\frac{23}{42}} = \\frac{1}{210} \\times \\frac{42}{23} = \\frac{42}{210 \\times 23}\n\\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{42}{210} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{42}{210} = \\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{Grand Prize} \\mid \\text{Prize}) = \\frac{1}{5 \\times 23} = \\frac{1}{115}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe probability is \\( \\frac{1}{115} \\). Since 1 and 115 are relatively prime, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 115 \\). Therefore, \\( m + n = 116 \\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{116}\\)"
