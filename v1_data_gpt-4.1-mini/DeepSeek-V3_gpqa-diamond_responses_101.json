        "question": "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\nA. the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\nB. ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\nC. the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\nD. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame",
        "response": "The most likely reason for not observing a green signal in the offspring of the SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice crossed with the homozygous construct mouse is:\n\n**D. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.**\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Construct Design**: The receptor is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, and there is a stop codon in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. For eGFP to be expressed, the stop codon must be excised by Cre recombinase, and the receptor and eGFP must be in the correct reading frame.\n\n2. **Cre Recombination**: SOX10-Cre should excise the stop codon in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, allowing the expression of eGFP. However, if the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame after recombination, eGFP will not be expressed, even if the stop codon is removed.\n\n3. **Observation**: The absence of a green signal suggests that eGFP is not being produced. This is most likely due to a frameshift between the receptor and eGFP after Cre-mediated excision of the stop codon.\n\n4. **Other Options**:\n   - **A**: If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, you would still observe a green signal, albeit localized to the Golgi.\n   - **B**: A paracrine relationship between the ligand and receptor would not prevent eGFP expression; it would only affect their interaction.\n   - **C**: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is not relevant here, as the construct is already designed to express these proteins under specific promoters.\n\nThus, the most plausible explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame after Cre-mediated excision, preventing eGFP expression."
