        "question": "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?\nA. ~0.75\nB. ~0.83\nC. ~0.57\nD. ~0.69",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 in this system. The planets have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Alright, let's start by recalling what equilibrium temperature depends on. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to the amount of stellar radiation it receives, which is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the star. But since we don't have distances here, only orbital periods, I need to connect orbital periods to distances. \n\nOh right, Kepler's third law! That relates the orbital period of a planet to its distance from the star. Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is just the radius. So mathematically, that's \\( P^2 \\propto a^3 \\), where P is the period and a is the radius (distance from the star). \n\nSo if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a) for Planet_4 and Planet_2, I can then relate that to the flux each planet receives, and consequently their equilibrium temperatures. \n\nFirst, let's note the given period ratios. The problem states the periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. So Planet_1 has period P1 = 1, Planet_2 P2 = 2, Planet_3 P3 = 2.5, Planet_4 P4 = 3.5, and Planet_5 P5 = 5. These are ratios, so the actual periods could be in any units, but the ratios are what matter here.\n\nUsing Kepler's third law, \\( P^2 \\propto a^3 \\), so \\( a \\propto P^{2/3} \\). Therefore, the semi-major axis (distance from the star) of each planet is proportional to their orbital period raised to the power of 2/3. \n\nSo for Planet_4, a4 \u221d (3.5)^(2/3), and for Planet_2, a2 \u221d (2)^(2/3). Therefore, the ratio of their distances from the star would be (3.5/2)^(2/3). Wait, but actually, since each a is proportional to their own P^(2/3), the ratio a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (3.5/2)^(2/3). \n\nBut equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance, right? Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and the equilibrium temperature is proportional to the fourth root of the flux (since flux is power per unit area, and temperature is related to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is proportional to the fourth power). Wait, let me recall the formula. \n\nThe equilibrium temperature T is given by \\( T = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - \\text{albedo})}{16 \\pi \\sigma a^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\), where L is the star's luminosity, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the distance from the star. Since albedo is the same for both planets, and assuming L is the same (same star), then T \u221d a^{-1/2}. So the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. \n\nBut since a is proportional to P^{2/3}, substituting that into the temperature relation gives T \u221d (P^{2/3})^{-1/2} = P^{-1/3}. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^{-1/3} = (3.5/2)^{-1/3}. \n\nLet me compute that. First, compute 3.5 divided by 2. 3.5 is 7/2, so 7/2 divided by 2 is 7/4. So 3.5/2 = 7/4. Therefore, the ratio is (7/4)^{-1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3}. \n\nCalculating the cube root of 4/7. Let's see, 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714. The cube root of 0.5714. Hmm. Let's approximate. \n\nI know that cube root of 0.5 is about 0.7937, cube root of 0.6 is approximately 0.843, cube root of 0.5714 would be between those. Let's see:\n\n0.5714 is between 0.512 (which is 0.8^3) and 0.729 (0.9^3). Wait, but 0.5714 is closer to 0.512. Let me compute 0.83^3: 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, then *0.83 \u2248 0.5716. Oh! Wait, that's exactly 0.83^3 \u2248 0.5716, which is very close to 0.5714. So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. Therefore, (4/7)^{1/3} \u2248 0.83. Therefore, T4/T2 \u2248 0.83. \n\nLooking at the options, B is ~0.83. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my reasoning. Let's recap:\n\n1. Equilibrium temperature T \u221d a^{-1/2}.\n2. From Kepler's third law, a \u221d P^{2/3}.\n3. Therefore, T \u221d P^{-1/3}.\n4. So T4/T2 = (P4/P2)^{-1/3} = (3.5/2)^{-1/3} = (7/4)^{-1/3} = (4/7)^{1/3} \u2248 0.83.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}"
