        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u0127 when we're in the state |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with angular momentum coupling, the state |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m\u27e9 is a coupled state, which is a combination of the uncoupled states |l\u2081, m\u2081\u27e9|l\u2082, m\u2082\u27e9. The total angular momentum quantum number l here is 2, and the z-component m is -1. Since each electron is in a p orbital, their individual angular momentum quantum numbers l\u2081 and l\u2082 are both 1. \n\nThe question is about the joint probability of measuring L\u2081z = -\u0127 and L\u2082z = -\u0127. Since L_z has eigenvalues m\u0127, so -\u0127 corresponds to m = -1 for each electron. So we need to find the probability that both electrons have m\u2081 = -1 and m\u2082 = -1 when measured. \n\nBut the system is in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1\u27e9. To find this probability, I think I need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states |m\u2081, m\u2082\u27e9. The probability will then be the square of the coefficient of the term |m\u2081=-1, m\u2082=-1\u27e9 in that expansion.\n\nSo, first, let me recall how to write the coupled states in terms of the uncoupled states. The general formula for the coupled state |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m\u27e9 is a linear combination of the uncoupled states |m\u2081, m\u2082\u27e9 where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = m. Here, m is -1, so m\u2081 + m\u2082 must equal -1. Since each electron has l=1, their m values can be -1, 0, +1. \n\nTherefore, the possible pairs (m\u2081, m\u2082) that add up to -1 are:\n- ( -1, 0 )\n- ( 0, -1 )\n\nWait, but hold on, are there more? Let me check. If m\u2081 can be -1, 0, +1 and m\u2082 similarly, then the pairs where their sum is -1 are indeed (-1,0), (0,-1), and also (-1, -1) would give -2, which is too low, and (0,0) gives 0, so no. So only those two combinations. Hmm, but wait, actually, maybe I missed something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, m\u2081 + m\u2082 = m_total = -1. So possible m\u2081 and m\u2082 pairs are:\n\nm\u2081 = -1, m\u2082 = 0 \u2192 sum -1\n\nm\u2081 = 0, m\u2082 = -1 \u2192 sum -1\n\nm\u2081 = -2, m\u2082 = 1 \u2192 but m can't be -2 for l=1. So those are the only two possibilities. Wait, but m can only be from -l to +l in integers. Since l=1, m can be -1,0,+1. So yes, only those two pairs. \n\nTherefore, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1\u27e9 must be a combination of | -1, 0 \u27e9 and | 0, -1 \u27e9. But wait, is that all? Let me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients here. \n\nThe coupled state |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m\u27e9 is constructed using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The coefficients for the case l\u2081 = l\u2082 = 1, l = 2, m = -1. Let me recall the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two angular momenta. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can construct the state step by step. Let me think. \n\nFirst, the total angular momentum l = 2, so the maximum m is +2, and the minimum is -2. The state |2, -1\u27e9 is one of the states in the coupled basis. To express this in terms of the uncoupled basis, we need to consider all possible m\u2081 and m\u2082 such that m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1, and also that the combination is part of the l=2 multiplet. \n\nWait, but actually, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l\u2081 = l\u2082 = 1, l = 2, m = -1. Let me look up the coefficients or recall them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the ladder operators. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recall that for two p electrons, the triplet and singlet states. Wait, but here we are dealing with orbital angular momentum, not spin, so the coupling is similar but without considering spin. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write down the state |1,1,2,-1\u27e9 in terms of the uncoupled states. Let me recall that the general form for the coupled state |l\u2081,l\u2082,l,m\u27e9 is a linear combination of |m\u2081,m\u2082\u27e9 where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = m. The coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nSo for l\u2081 = 1, l\u2082 = 1, l = 2, m = -1. The possible m\u2081 and m\u2082 pairs are indeed (-1,0) and (0,-1). \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |1,1,2,-1\u27e9 is given by the combination of these two terms. Let me recall the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the coefficients. Let me see. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be calculated using recursion relations or using known tables. Since this is a common case, maybe I can remember the coefficients for coupling two angular momenta of 1 each. \n\nLet me think of the state |l\u2081,l\u2082,l,m\u27e9 = |1,1,2,-1\u27e9. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case can be found as follows. \n\nFirst, the maximum m state for l=2 is |2,2\u27e9, which would be |1,1\u27e9, since m\u2081 + m\u2082 = 2 requires both m\u2081 and m\u2082 to be +1. \n\nThen, to get the next state with m=1, we can apply the lowering operator. But perhaps that's more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for two angular momenta l\u2081 and l\u2082, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for the state |l\u2081,l\u2082,l,m\u27e9 can be written as a combination of |m\u2081,m\u2082\u27e9 where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = m. \n\nThe coefficients are determined by the requirement that the state is an eigenstate of L\u00b2 and L_z, and also orthogonal to other states in the multiplet. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look up the coefficients for l\u2081 = l\u2082 = 1, l = 2, m = -1. \n\nWait, here's a way to think about it. The state |2, -1\u27e9 must be a combination of the states where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1. The possible terms are | -1, 0 \u27e9 and | 0, -1 \u27e9. \n\nThe coefficients for these terms can be found by considering the normalization and the requirement that the state is an eigenstate of L\u00b2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nThe general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8m\u2081 m\u2082 | l m\u27e9 is given by some expression involving factorials and square roots. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that for the state |l\u2081,l\u2082,l,m\u27e9, the coefficients can be determined by starting from the highest m state and applying lowering operators. \n\nLet me try that approach. \n\nFirst, the highest m state for l=2 is |2,2\u27e9, which is |1,1\u27e9. \n\nThen, to get the state with m=1, we can apply the lowering operator L\u207b = L\u2081\u207b + L\u2082\u207b to |2,2\u27e9. \n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that for two p electrons, the triplet states (l=2) have the following components:\n\nThe state |2,2\u27e9 is |1,1\u27e9.\n\nThe state |2,1\u27e9 is (|1,0\u27e9 + |0,1\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nWait, no, actually, for l=2, m=1, the state would be a combination of |1,0\u27e9 and |0,1\u27e9. But actually, let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, when coupling two angular momenta l\u2081 and l\u2082, the states for the total angular momentum l are constructed such that the coefficients are symmetric or antisymmetric depending on the coupling. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can refer to the standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients table. \n\nLooking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l\u2081 = 1, l\u2082 = 1, l = 2, m = -1. \n\nFrom standard tables, for example, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for coupling two angular momenta of 1:\n\nThe state |2, -1\u27e9 is given by:\n\n\u27e8m\u2081 m\u2082 | 2, -1\u27e9 = ?\n\nLooking at the table, for l\u2081 = 1, l\u2082 = 1, l = 2, m = -1:\n\nThe coefficients are:\n\n\u27e8-1, 0 | 2, -1\u27e9 = sqrt(2/3)\n\n\u27e80, -1 | 2, -1\u27e9 = sqrt(2/3)\n\nWait, but that would give a total of sqrt(2/3) for each term, so when squared, each term would contribute 2/3, but adding them would give 4/3, which is more than 1. Hmm, that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients are each sqrt(1/3), so that when squared, they add to 2/3. Wait, but then the total would be 2/3. Hmm, maybe I need to think more carefully. \n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for the state |l\u2081,l\u2082,l,m\u27e9, the coefficients are determined such that the state is orthogonal to the other states in the multiplet. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the state |2, -1\u27e9. Since m = -1, the possible m\u2081 and m\u2082 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Let me denote the coefficients as a and b for these two terms respectively. \n\nSo the state is a| -1, 0 \u27e9 + b| 0, -1 \u27e9. \n\nTo find a and b, we can use the fact that this state must be orthogonal to the other states in the l=2 multiplet. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the normalization condition. \n\nThe normalization requires that |a|\u00b2 + |b|\u00b2 = 1. \n\nAdditionally, the state must be an eigenstate of L\u00b2 with eigenvalue l(l+1)\u0127\u00b2 = 2*3\u0127\u00b2 = 6\u0127\u00b2. \n\nBut maybe that's too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the lowering operator approach. \n\nStarting from the highest m state |2,2\u27e9 = |1,1\u27e9. \n\nThen, applying the lowering operator L\u207b = L\u2081\u207b + L\u2082\u207b to |2,2\u27e9 gives sqrt(2(2+1) - 2\u00b2) |2,1\u27e9? Wait, no, actually, the lowering operator reduces m by 1. \n\nWait, the lowering operator L\u207b acting on |l,m\u27e9 gives sqrt(l(l+1) - m(m-1))\u0127 |l, m-1\u27e9. \n\nSo, applying L\u207b to |2,2\u27e9 gives sqrt(2*3 - 2*1)\u0127 |2,1\u27e9 = sqrt(6 - 2)\u0127 |2,1\u27e9 = sqrt(4)\u0127 |2,1\u27e9 = 2\u0127 |2,1\u27e9. \n\nBut L\u207b is also equal to L\u2081\u207b + L\u2082\u207b. \n\nTherefore, L\u207b |2,2\u27e9 = (L\u2081\u207b + L\u2082\u207b)|1,1\u27e9. \n\nCompute that:\n\nL\u2081\u207b |1,1\u27e9 is sqrt(1(1+1) - 1(1-1))\u0127 |1,0\u27e9 = sqrt(2 - 0)\u0127 |1,0\u27e9 = sqrt(2)\u0127 |1,0\u27e9.\n\nSimilarly, L\u2082\u207b |1,1\u27e9 is the same, since it's acting on the second particle: sqrt(2)\u0127 |1,0\u27e9 for the second particle. \n\nTherefore, (L\u2081\u207b + L\u2082\u207b)|1,1\u27e9 = sqrt(2)\u0127 |1,0\u27e9|1,1\u27e9 + sqrt(2)\u0127 |1,1\u27e9|1,0\u27e9. \n\nWait, actually, the first term is L\u2081\u207b acting on the first particle, so it becomes sqrt(2)\u0127 |1,0\u27e9 for the first particle, and the second particle remains |1,1\u27e9. Wait, no, actually, the state |1,1\u27e9 is |m\u2081=1, m\u2082=1\u27e9. \n\nTherefore, L\u2081\u207b |m\u2081=1, m\u2082=1\u27e9 = sqrt(2)\u0127 |m\u2081=0, m\u2082=1\u27e9,\n\nand L\u2082\u207b |m\u2081=1, m\u2082=1\u27e9 = sqrt(2)\u0127 |m\u2081=1, m\u2082=0\u27e9.\n\nTherefore, the total is sqrt(2)\u0127 ( |0,1\u27e9 + |1,0\u27e9 ). \n\nTherefore, L\u207b |2,2\u27e9 = sqrt(2)\u0127 ( |0,1\u27e9 + |1,0\u27e9 ). \n\nBut we also have that L\u207b |2,2\u27e9 = 2\u0127 |2,1\u27e9. \n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions:\n\nsqrt(2)\u0127 ( |0,1\u27e9 + |1,0\u27e9 ) = 2\u0127 |2,1\u27e9 \n\nTherefore, |2,1\u27e9 = ( sqrt(2)/2 ) ( |0,1\u27e9 + |1,0\u27e9 ) = (1/\u221a2)( |0,1\u27e9 + |1,0\u27e9 )\n\nSo that's the state for m=1. \n\nNow, let's go to m=0.

Wait, no, l\u2082 is 1, so m can be -1,0,+1. So m=-1 is the lowest, so L\u2082\u207b acting on | -1 \u27e9 is zero.\n\nTherefore, L\u2082\u207b|1, -1\u27e9 = |1\u27e9 \u2297 0 = 0.\n\nThus, L\u207b|1, -1\u27e9 = sqrt(2)\u0127 |0, -1\u27e9.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nL\u207b |2,0\u27e9 = (1/sqrt(6)) [ sqrt(2)\u0127 | -1,0 \u27e9 + 2 sqrt(2)\u0127 ( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1 \u27e9 ) + sqrt(2)\u0127 |0, -1\u27e9 ]\n\nLet me factor out sqrt(2)\u0127 / sqrt(6):\n\n= ( sqrt(2)\u0127 / sqrt(6) ) [ | -1,0 \u27e9 + 2( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1 \u27e9 ) + |0, -1\u27e9 ]\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: | -1,0 \u27e9\n\nSecond term: 2| -1,0 \u27e9 + 2|0, -1 \u27e9\n\nThird term: |0, -1\u27e9\n\nTotal:\n\n(1 + 2)| -1,0 \u27e9 + (2 +1)|0, -1\u27e9 = 3| -1,0 \u27e9 + 3|0, -1\u27e9\n\nTherefore,\n\nL\u207b |2,0\u27e9 = ( sqrt(2)\u0127 / sqrt(6) ) * 3 ( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1\u27e9 )\n\nSimplify constants:\n\nsqrt(2)/sqrt(6) = sqrt(2)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3)\n\nThus,\n\nL\u207b |2,0\u27e9 = ( 3 * 1/sqrt(3) ) \u0127 ( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1\u27e9 ) = sqrt(3) \u0127 ( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1\u27e9 )\n\nBut according to the lowering operator formula, this should equal sqrt(6)\u0127 |2,-1\u27e9. Wait, but here we have sqrt(3)\u0127 times ( ... ). Hmm, so equate:\n\nsqrt(6)\u0127 |2,-1\u27e9 = sqrt(3)\u0127 ( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1\u27e9 )\n\nDivide both sides by \u0127:\n\nsqrt(6) |2,-1\u27e9 = sqrt(3) ( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1\u27e9 )\n\nTherefore,\n\n|2,-1\u27e9 = ( sqrt(3)/sqrt(6) ) ( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1\u27e9 ) = (1/\u221a2)( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1\u27e9 )\n\nAh, okay, so finally, the state |2,-1\u27e9 is (1/\u221a2)( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1 \u27e9 )\n\nWait, but hold on, sqrt(3)/sqrt(6) is sqrt(3/6) = sqrt(1/2) = 1/\u221a2. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1\u27e9 is (1/\u221a2)( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1 \u27e9 )\n\nTherefore, when expressed in terms of the uncoupled basis states, it's a combination of |m\u2081=-1, m\u2082=0\u27e9 and |m\u2081=0, m\u2082=-1\u27e9 each with coefficient 1/\u221a2. \n\nTherefore, the coefficients for | -1,0 \u27e9 and |0, -1 \u27e9 are each 1/\u221a2. \n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring L\u2081z = -\u0127 and L\u2082z = -\u0127 would correspond to the term | -1, -1 \u27e9, but in this expansion, there is no such term. The state only has | -1,0 \u27e9 and |0, -1 \u27e9. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient for | -1, -1 \u27e9 is zero. \n\nTherefore, the joint probability is zero. \n\nWait, but hold on, the question is asking for the joint probability of both L\u2081z and L\u2082z being -\u0127, which corresponds to m\u2081 = -1 and m\u2082 = -1. But in the expansion of |2,-1\u27e9, there is no | -1, -1 \u27e9 term. Therefore, the probability is zero. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A) 0. \n\nBut let me double-check. \n\nWait, the total m is -1, so m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1. The pair ( -1, -1 ) would give m_total = -2, which is a different state. The state |2,-1\u27e9 can't have that term because m_total must be -1. \n\nTherefore, indeed, the only terms contributing are those with m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1, which are ( -1,0 ) and (0, -1 ). Therefore, there is no term with both m\u2081 and m\u2082 being -1. \n\nTherefore, the probability is zero. \n\nHmm, so the answer is A) 0. \n\nWait, but let me check again if I made a mistake in the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me see. \n\nWait, when I derived the state |2,-1\u27e9, I found it to be (1/\u221a2)( | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1 \u27e9 ). Therefore, the coefficients for those two terms are each 1/\u221a2. \n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring either of those states is (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2 for each. \n\nBut the question is asking for the probability of both electrons having m = -1, which is the | -1, -1 \u27e9 term, which isn't present here. \n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me check another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. \n\nThe Clebsch-Gordan coefficient \u27e8m\u2081 m\u2082 | l\u2081 l\u2082; l m\u27e9 is given by some formula. \n\nThe general formula is a bit complicated, but for the case when l = l\u2081 + l\u2082, which is 2 here, the coefficients are simpler. \n\nWait, when l = l\u2081 + l\u2082, which is the maximum possible l, then the state is symmetric. \n\nWait, but in our case, l\u2081 = l\u2082 =1, so l_max = 2, so the state |2, m\u27e9 is symmetric under exchange of the two particles. \n\nTherefore, the state |2, -1\u27e9 must be symmetric. \n\nLooking at the terms | -1,0 \u27e9 and |0, -1 \u27e9, these are symmetric when combined with equal coefficients. \n\nIndeed, | -1,0 \u27e9 + |0, -1 \u27e9 is symmetric. \n\nTherefore, the state is symmetric, so that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the expansion is correct. \n\nTherefore, the term | -1, -1 \u27e9 is not present here. \n\nTherefore, the probability is zero. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 0. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the total m is -1. The only way to get that is with m\u2081 and m\u2082 adding to -1. So if you want both m\u2081 and m\u2082 to be -1, that would give m_total = -2, which is a different state. \n\nTherefore, in the given state |2, -1\u27e9, there is no component where both electrons have m = -1. \n\nTherefore, the probability is zero. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 0. \n\nHmm, but let me check if the question is about orbital angular momentum, so spin is ignored. So the state is just the orbital angular momentum part. \n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 0. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose someone might think that maybe the state could have a term with m\u2081 = -1 and m\u2082 = 0, but that's already accounted for. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Let me check a table. \n\nLooking up Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1. \n\nAccording to standard tables (like those found in textbooks or online), for example, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |2, -1\u27e9 is indeed a combination of | -1,0 \u27e9 and |0, -1 \u27e9 with equal coefficients. \n\nFor instance, according to the table here (imagining I'm recalling from memory or a standard reference):\n\nThe coefficients for |2, -1\u27e9 are:\n\n\u27e8-1,0 | 2, -1\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2,\n\n\u27e80, -1 | 2, -1\u27e9 = 1/\u221a2,\n\nand all other \u27e8m1,m2 | 2, -1\u27e9 are zero. \n\nTherefore, the expansion is correct. \n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A) 0. \n\nI think that's solid. So I'll go with A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the joint probability of measuring both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) as \\( -\\hbar \\) for the state \\( |l_1, l_2, l, m\\rangle = |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle \\), we need to express this coupled state in terms of the uncoupled basis states \\( |m_1, m_2\\rangle \\).\n\n1. **Identify the possible \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) values**:\n   - The total angular momentum quantum number \\( l = 2 \\) and the z-component \\( m = -1 \\).\n   - The possible pairs \\( (m_1, m_2) \\) such that \\( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \\) are \\( (-1, 0) \\) and \\( (0, -1) \\).\n\n2. **Express the coupled state in terms of uncoupled states**:\n   - Using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, the state \\( |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle \\) is a combination of the uncoupled states \\( |-1, 0\\rangle \\) and \\( |0, -1\\rangle \\).\n   - The coefficients are determined to be \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\) for each term due to symmetry and normalization.\n\n3. **Determine the probability**:\n   - The state \\( |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |-1, 0\\rangle + |0, -1\\rangle \\right)\n     \\]\n   - The term \\( |-1, -1\\rangle \\) (corresponding to both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) being \\( -\\hbar \\)) is not present in this expansion.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no component of \\( |-1, -1\\rangle \\) in the state \\( |1, 1, 2, -1\\rangle \\), the probability of measuring both \\( L_{1z} \\) and \\( L_{2z} \\) as \\( -\\hbar \\) is zero.\n\nThus, the joint probability is \\(\\boxed{A}\\)."
