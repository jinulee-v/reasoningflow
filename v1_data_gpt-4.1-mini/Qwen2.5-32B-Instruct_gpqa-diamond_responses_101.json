        "question": "You identified a new ligand-receptor pair initially expressed in the neural crest cells and want to understand the developmental fate of their interaction. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane barrel with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets that create a binding site for the ligand. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices. You create a bicistronic lox-Cre vector with the ligand ORF at the 5' position, fused to mCherry; the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and the eGFP, there is a stop in the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. You had also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and now use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture. Total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading. You finally breed a mouse model homozygous for your construct in the wt background. You cross it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice; after the offspring is born you visualize them under the fluorescent confocal microscope. You do not observe a green signal. Which of the answers below explains the most likely reason for it?\nA. the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi\nB. ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship\nC. the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing\nD. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame",
        "response": "Given the experimental setup described, the most likely explanation for not observing a green signal (eGFP) in the offspring under the fluorescent confocal microscope is:\n\nD. the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame\n\nThis option suggests a potential issue with the bicistronic vector's design or the Cre-mediated recombination process. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be properly translated, leading to no green fluorescence. This could happen if the stop codon between the receptor and eGFP was not effectively removed by Cre recombinase due to issues with the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette or if there were errors in the cloning process.\n\nThe other options are less likely because:\n- A. If the receptor-eGFP construct were stuck in the Golgi, it might still be detectable by Western blotting, which you have already performed.\n- B. A paracrine relationship between the ligand and receptor does not directly explain why the eGFP signal is absent.\n- C. While an enhancer issue could affect expression levels, the absence of any green signal suggests a more fundamental problem with the expression or translation of the eGFP protein itself."
