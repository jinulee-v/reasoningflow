        "question": "Consider the paths of length $16$ that follow the lines from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an $8\\times 8$ grid. Find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times, as in the examples shown below.",
        "response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm still getting the hang of combinatorics, but I'll try my best to understand and solve this.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nWe have an \\(8 \\times 8\\) grid, and we need to find the number of paths of length 16 that start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner. These paths must change direction exactly four times.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid. It's an 8x8 grid, so there are 8 rows and 8 columns. The path starts at the bottom-left corner and ends at the top-right corner. The total length of the path is 16, which makes sense because to go from the bottom-left to the top-right, we need to move right 8 times and up 8 times, totaling 16 moves.\n\nThe path must change direction exactly four times. Changing direction means switching from moving right to moving up or vice versa.\n\n**Breaking Down the Problem:**\n\n1. **Total Moves:** 16 moves (8 right and 8 up).\n2. **Direction Changes:** Exactly 4 times.\n\nLet's think about what a path with exactly 4 direction changes looks like.\n\n**Visualizing Direction Changes:**\n\nA path with 4 direction changes will alternate between moving right and moving up. For example:\n\n- Start by moving right, then up, then right, then up, then right, then up, and so on.\n\nBut since we have exactly 4 direction changes, the path will have 5 segments (since each direction change separates segments).\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- If we change direction 4 times, the path will have 5 segments.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Move right\n2. Change direction to up\n3. Move up\n4. Change direction to right\n5. Move right\n6. Change direction to up\n7. Move up\n8. Change direction to right\n9. Move right\n\nWait, that's more than 4 direction changes. Let's correct that.\n\nIf we have exactly 4 direction changes, the path will have 5 segments.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Move right\n2. Change direction to up\n3. Move up\n4. Change direction to right\n5. Move right\n6. Change direction to up\n7. Move up\n8. Change direction to right\n9. Move right\n\nWait, that's still more than 4 direction changes. Let's think differently.\n\nIf we have exactly 4 direction changes, the path will alternate directions 4 times, resulting in 5 segments.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Move right\n2. Change direction to up\n3. Move up\n4. Change direction to right\n5. Move right\n6. Change direction to up\n7. Move up\n8. Change direction to right\n9. Move right\n\nWait, that's still more than 4 direction changes. I think I'm miscounting.\n\nLet's try this:\n\nIf we have exactly 4 direction changes, the path will have 5 segments.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Move right\n2. Change direction to up\n3. Move up\n4. Change direction to right\n5. Move right\n6. Change direction to up\n7. Move up\n8. Change direction to right\n9. Move right\n\nWait, that's still more than 4 direction changes. I think I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nLet's think of the path as a sequence of moves: right (R) and up (U). The total number of moves is 16, with 8 R's and 8 U's.\n\nWe need exactly 4 direction changes. A direction change occurs when we switch from R to U or from U to R.\n\nSo, the sequence will have 4 points where the direction changes.\n\nLet's think of the sequence as having 5 segments (since 4 direction changes separate them).\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Segment 1: R's\n2. Segment 2: U's\n3. Segment 3: R's\n4. Segment 4: U's\n5. Segment 5: R's\n\nBut wait, the total number of R's is 8, and U's is 8.\n\nSo, the sum of R's in all segments should be 8, and the sum of U's should be 8.\n\nLet's denote the number of R's in each segment as \\( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5 \\), and U's as \\( u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5 \\).\n\nBut since the segments alternate between R's and U's, some of these will be zero.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf we start with R's, the segments will be:\n\n1. R's (\\( r_1 \\))\n2. U's (\\( u_1 \\))\n3. R's (\\( r_2 \\))\n4. U's (\\( u_2 \\))\n5. R's (\\( r_3 \\))\n\nSimilarly, if we start with U's, the segments will be:\n\n1. U's (\\( u_1 \\))\n2. R's (\\( r_1 \\))\n3. U's (\\( u_2 \\))\n4. R's (\\( r_2 \\))\n5. U's (\\( u_3 \\))\n\nWait, but we have exactly 4 direction changes, so the number of segments should be 5.\n\nLet's consider both cases:\n\n**Case 1:** Starting with R's.\n\nSegments:\n\n1. R's (\\( r_1 \\))\n2. U's (\\( u_1 \\))\n3. R's (\\( r_2 \\))\n4. U's (\\( u_2 \\))\n5. R's (\\( r_3 \\))\n\nTotal R's: \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 8 \\)\n\nTotal U's: \\( u_1 + u_2 = 8 \\)\n\n**Case 2:** Starting with U's.\n\nSegments:\n\n1. U's (\\( u_1 \\))\n2. R's (\\( r_1 \\))\n3. U's (\\( u_2 \\))\n4. R's (\\( r_2 \\))\n5. U's (\\( u_3 \\))\n\nTotal R's: \\( r_1 + r_2 = 8 \\)\n\nTotal U's: \\( u_1 + u_2 + u_3 = 8 \\)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of solutions for each case.\n\n**Case 1:** Starting with R's.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 8 \\)\n\n\\( u_1 + u_2 = 8 \\)\n\nEach \\( r_i \\) and \\( u_i \\) must be at least 1 because each segment must have at least one move.\n\nSo, we can use the stars and bars method.\n\nFor \\( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 8 \\), with \\( r_i \\geq 1 \\):\n\nNumber of solutions: \\( \\binom{8-1}{3-1} = \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n\nFor \\( u_1 + u_2 = 8 \\), with \\( u_i \\geq 1 \\):\n\nNumber of solutions: \\( \\binom{8-1}{2-1} = \\binom{7}{1} = 7 \\)\n\nTotal for Case 1: \\( 21 \\times 7 = 147 \\)\n\n**Case 2:** Starting with U's.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\( r_1 + r_2 = 8 \\)\n\n\\( u_1 + u_2 + u_3 = 8 \\)\n\nAgain, each \\( r_i \\) and \\( u_i \\geq 1 \\).\n\nFor \\( r_1 + r_2 = 8 \\), with \\( r_i \\geq 1 \\):\n\nNumber of solutions: \\( \\binom{8-1}{2-1} = \\binom{7}{1} = 7 \\)\n\nFor \\( u_1 + u_2 + u_3 = 8 \\), with \\( u_i \\geq 1 \\):\n\nNumber of solutions: \\( \\binom{8-1}{3-1} = \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\)\n\nTotal for Case 2: \\( 7 \\times 21 = 147 \\)\n\n**Total Number of Paths:**\n\nTotal paths = Case 1 + Case 2 = \\( 147 + 147 = 294 \\)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAfter carefully analyzing both cases and applying the stars and bars method, we find that the number of paths of length 16 on an \\(8 \\times 8\\) grid that change direction exactly four times is **294**."
