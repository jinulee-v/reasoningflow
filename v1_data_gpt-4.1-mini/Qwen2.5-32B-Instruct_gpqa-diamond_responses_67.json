        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the magnetic moment of a spin-1/2 particle evolves when the magnetic field changes direction.\n\nInitially, the particle's magnetic moment \\(\\mu\\) is aligned with the magnetic field \\(B\\) in the +Z direction. This means that the particle is in an eigenstate of the \\(S_z\\) operator, which corresponds to the state \\(|+\\rangle\\).\n\nWhen the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then turned on again in the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes from \\(H = -\\gamma B S_z\\) to \\(H' = -\\gamma B S_y\\). Here, \\(\\gamma\\) is the gyromagnetic ratio, and \\(S_y\\) is the spin operator in the Y direction.\n\nThe new Hamiltonian \\(H'\\) causes the state of the particle to evolve according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Since the initial state \\(|+\\rangle\\) (which is an eigenstate of \\(S_z\\)) is not an eigenstate of \\(S_y\\), the state will start to oscillate between the eigenstates of \\(S_y\\), which are \\(|+\\rangle_y\\) and \\(|-\\rangle_y\\).\n\nThe frequency of these oscillations is given by the energy difference between the two eigenstates of \\(S_y\\), divided by Planck's constant. For a spin-1/2 particle, the energy levels are split by \\(\\gamma B\\), and the transition frequency is \\(\\omega = \\gamma B\\).\n\nHowever, since the initial state \\(|+\\rangle\\) is not directly aligned with the new magnetic field direction, the effective oscillation involves a superposition of states and thus the frequency of the observable oscillation in the expectation value of \\(S_z\\) is half of the full transition frequency due to the projection onto the new basis.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is \\(\\frac{\\gamma B}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\(\\gamma B / 2\\)"
