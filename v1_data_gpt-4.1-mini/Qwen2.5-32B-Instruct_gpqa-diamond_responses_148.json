        "question": "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nB. The compound is contaminated with a precursor\nC. 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\nD.

        "response": "Given the information provided, the most likely explanation for the observations is:\n\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.\n\nHere's why this option is the most plausible:\n\n- **NMR Observations**: The presence of two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, suggests that there are two distinct environments for this proton in the sample. This could be due to different spatial arrangements of the atoms around the chiral center(s) in the molecule, which is characteristic of diastereoisomers.\n  \n- **LC-MS Analysis**: The LC-MS showing two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities, each with the same mass spectrum, further supports the idea of a mixture of compounds with identical molecular weights but different configurations. Diastereoisomers would have the same molecular formula and thus the same mass, but different retention times in chromatography due to their different three-dimensional structures.\n\n- **Ruling Out Other Options**:\n  - **Option B (Contamination with a Precursor)**: If the contamination were with a precursor, it would likely show up as a separate peak in the mass spectrum with a different molecular weight, which is not observed here.\n  - **Option C ('Double Coupling')**: While double coupling can occur, it typically results in more complex splitting patterns rather than two distinct peaks of equal intensity.\n  - **Option D (Mixture of Enantiomers)**: Enantiomers have identical chemical shifts in NMR because they are mirror images of each other and cannot be distinguished by NMR alone. However, they would also have the same retention time in LC-MS unless the separation method specifically resolves them based on chirality, which is not indicated here.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which explains both the NMR and LC-MS observations."
