        "question": "In an inactive state, a transcription factor subunit awaits an activation signal from the membrane phosphorylation cascade. Upon phosphorylation on the Ser residues in the transactivation domain, it dimerizes, shuttles into the nucleus, and serves in gene transcription. A missense mutation X in the transactivation domain is a recessive loss-of-function mutation. You observe that a heterozygous mutation Y in the dimerization domain acts as a dominant-negative mutation. Which of the following molecular phenotypes is most likely observed in the presence of mutation Y?\nA. change of protein conformation and gain-of-function phenotype\nB. loss of protein dimerization and wild-type phenotype\nC. protein aggregation and loss-of-function phenotype\nD. protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele",
        "response": "The correct answer is D: protein degradation and loss-of-function of the wild-type allele.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Mutation Y** is described as a heterozygous mutation in the dimerization domain that acts as a dominant-negative mutation. This means that the mutant protein not only fails to function properly but also interferes with the function of the wild-type protein.\n- In the context of dimerization, if one subunit (the mutant) cannot form a functional dimer with the wild-type subunit, it can lead to the formation of non-functional complexes. These complexes may be recognized as aberrant by cellular quality control mechanisms, leading to their degradation.\n- The degradation of these mixed complexes would result in a loss of function for both the mutant and the wild-type alleles, effectively reducing the overall activity of the transcription factor.\n\nTherefore, the presence of mutation Y leads to the degradation of the protein complex and a loss-of-function phenotype affecting both the mutant and the wild-type alleles."
