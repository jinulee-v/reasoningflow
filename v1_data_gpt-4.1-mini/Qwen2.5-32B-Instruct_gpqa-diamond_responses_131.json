        "question": "The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\nA. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nB. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nD. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene",
        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information about the 1H NMR spectrum and match it with the possible structures of the compounds provided.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the aromatic region of the spectrum, which shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. This suggests that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton environment, and these environments are different between the two compounds.\n\nNext, the aliphatic region shows three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. This indicates that there are three distinct types of methyl or methylene groups, with two of them having equivalent protons.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\n- **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**: This compound would have all four methyl groups equivalent due to symmetry, leading to a single signal for the methyl groups.\n- **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**: This compound would have two sets of equivalent methyl groups, leading to two signals for the methyl groups.\n- **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**: This compound would have all four methyl groups equivalent due to symmetry, leading to a single signal for the methyl groups.\n- **1,4-diethylbenzene**: This compound would have two ethyl groups, leading to two signals for the methyl groups (one for each ethyl group) and one signal for the methylene groups.\n\nGiven the 2:1:1 ratio in the aliphatic region, the presence of 1,4-diethylbenzene is likely because it provides two methyl groups and one methylene group, fitting the observed ratio. The other compound must provide a single aromatic signal and fit the remaining conditions.\n\nAmong the tetramethylbenzenes, **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene** fits the criteria as it would give two methyl signals due to its structure, while the others would not provide the necessary diversity in the aliphatic region.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene**."
