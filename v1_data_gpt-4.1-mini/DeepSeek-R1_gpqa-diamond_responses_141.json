        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space. The density matrix provided is \u03c1 = 1/2(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|). The options are A through D with different coordinates for the Bloch vector r. Let me recall what I know about density matrices and the Bloch sphere representation.\n\nFirst, I remember that any qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices and the identity matrix. The general form is \u03c1 = (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, where r is the Bloch vector, and \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli matrices (\u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z). The Bloch vector's components (r_x, r_y, r_z) determine the position of the state in the Bloch sphere. For pure states, the Bloch vector lies on the surface of the sphere (|r| = 1), and for mixed states, it's inside the sphere (|r| < 1).\n\nGiven that \u03c1 here is a mixed state since it's a statistical mixture of |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 with equal probabilities, the Bloch vector should have a magnitude less than 1. Let me compute the Bloch vector components for the given \u03c1.\n\nThe density matrix \u03c1 = 1/2(|0\u27e9\u27e80| + |1\u27e9\u27e81|). Let me write this out explicitly. In the computational basis:\n\n|0\u27e9\u27e80| is [[1, 0], [0, 0]]\n|1\u27e9\u27e81| is [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\nSo adding them together and multiplying by 1/2 gives:\n\n\u03c1 = 1/2 * [[1, 0], [0, 0]] + 1/2 * [[0, 0], [0, 1]] = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]\n\nSo \u03c1 is a diagonal matrix with entries 1/2 on the diagonal. That's the maximally mixed state. Wait, the maximally mixed state is when the Bloch vector is zero, right? Because if all the Pauli matrices have coefficients zero, then \u03c1 = I/2. So in that case, the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0), which is option A.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step. The general density matrix is:\n\n\u03c1 = (I + r_x \u03c3_x + r_y \u03c3_y + r_z \u03c3_z)/2\n\nThe Pauli matrices are:\n\n\u03c3_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]\n\u03c3_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\u03c3_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\nSo if we compute (I + r\u00b7\u03c3)/2, we get:\n\n[[ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],\n [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ]]\n\nComparing this with our given \u03c1, which is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]], we can equate the components:\n\n(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 \u21d2 1 + r_z = 1 \u21d2 r_z = 0\n\nSimilarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 \u21d2 1 - r_z = 1 \u21d2 r_z = 0\n\nThe off-diagonal terms are (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 and (r_x + i r_y)/2 = 0. For these to be zero, both r_x and r_y must be zero. Therefore, r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which corresponds to option A.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The maximally mixed state is indeed when the density matrix is I/2, which is exactly this case. So the Bloch vector is at the origin, which makes sense because it's completely unpolarized\u2014there's no preferred direction. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me check the other options just to be thorough. Option B is (0,0,1), which would correspond to the state |0\u27e9\u27e80|, since the Bloch vector pointing along +z is |0\u27e9. Similarly, (0,0,-1) would be |1\u27e9. But here we have a mixture of |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 with equal probabilities, so intuitively, it's like averaging the two opposite points on the Bloch sphere, which would result in the origin. Similarly, mixing |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 equally cancels out any polarization direction, leading to the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nOptions C and D have non-zero x or y components, but since our density matrix has zero off-diagonal elements, which correspond to the x and y components of the Bloch vector, those must be zero. Therefore, only the z-component could be non-zero if there was a population imbalance between |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9. But here, since both are equal, z-component is zero as well. So all components are zero, hence r=(0,0,0), answer A.\n\nI think that's solid. So the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
