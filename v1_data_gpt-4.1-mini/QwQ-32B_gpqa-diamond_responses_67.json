        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment aligned along the +Z direction because of a magnetic field B in the same direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is asking about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. The options are given as A to D. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the magnetic moment \u03bc for a spin 1/2 particle is proportional to the spin angular momentum. Specifically, \u03bc = \u03b3\u015c, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. Since the problem states \u03bc = \u03b3*Sz, that must mean they're considering only the z-component here initially. But when the magnetic field direction changes, the spin will start precessing around the new field direction, which is along Y. The z-component of the magnetic moment will then oscillate as the spin precesses.\n\nLet me recall the time evolution of a spin in a magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field B is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B. Since \u03bc is proportional to the spin operator, H = -\u03b3\u015c\u00b7B. The time evolution of the spin state is governed by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, so the state vector will evolve according to the Hamiltonian.\n\nInitially, the particle is in the +Z eigenstate because it's aligned with the magnetic field along Z. Let's denote this state as |\u2191z\u27e9. When the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian changes instantaneously. The new Hamiltonian will be H' = -\u03b3\u015c\u00b7B\u0177, where B\u0177 is the magnetic field along Y. \n\nSince the Hamiltonian changes abruptly, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. Instead, the system will start evolving under the new Hamiltonian from the initial state |\u2191z\u27e9. The question is about the expectation value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9. So we need to find \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 as a function of time under the new Hamiltonian and then find its oscillation frequency.\n\nLet me write down the Hamiltonian in terms of the spin operators. The spin operators in the standard basis (eigenstates of \u015c_z) are:\n\n\u015c_x = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_x,\n\n\u015c_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y,\n\n\u015c_z = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_z,\n\nwhere \u03c3_x, \u03c3_y, \u03c3_z are the Pauli matrices.\n\nThe new Hamiltonian H' is -\u03b3\u015c\u00b7B\u0177. Let's compute that:\n\nH' = -\u03b3 (\u015c_x * 0 + \u015c_y * B + \u015c_z * 0) = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y.\n\nWait, actually, the magnetic field is along Y, so the components of B are (0, B, 0). Therefore, the dot product \u015c\u00b7B would be \u015c_x * 0 + \u015c_y * B + \u015c_z * 0 = B\u015c_y. Therefore, H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y. But actually, the Hamiltonian is H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, and \u03bc = \u03b3\u015c, so H = -\u03b3\u015c\u00b7B. So yes, that's correct. So H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y.\n\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian is proportional to \u015c_y. The time evolution operator will be U(t) = exp(-i H' t / \u0127). Since H' is proportional to \u015c_y, which is a Pauli matrix, we can write this in terms of the Pauli matrices.\n\nLet me recall that the time evolution under a Hamiltonian proportional to a Pauli matrix can be expressed using Euler's formula for matrices. For example, if H = \u03c9 \u015c_y, then U(t) = exp(-i \u03c9 \u015c_y t / \u0127). Since \u015c_y is a Pauli matrix multiplied by \u0127/2, let's substitute that in.\n\nWait, let me be precise here. Let me write H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y. Let's compute the units here. The Hamiltonian should have units of energy. The gyromagnetic ratio \u03b3 has units of (energy)/(Tesla) or equivalently (energy)/( (Tesla) ), but Tesla is kg/(C\u00b7s), so \u03b3 would have units of (C\u00b7s)/(kg) )? Hmm, maybe better to think in terms of H = -\u03bc\u00b7B, so \u03bc has units of (energy)/(Tesla), so \u03b3 must have units of (energy)/(Tesla\u00b7\u0127) or something? Maybe I should just proceed with the algebra.\n\nLet me note that \u015c_y has eigenvalues \u00b1\u0127/2. The Hamiltonian H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y, so the energy eigenvalues are E_\u00b1 = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1\u0127/2) = \u2213 \u03b3 B \u0127 / 2. Therefore, the energy difference between the two eigenstates is \u0394E = E_+ - E_- = -\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2 - (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) = -\u03b3 B \u0127. Wait, actually, the difference between the upper and lower eigenvalues would be (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) - (-\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) = \u03b3 B \u0127. So the energy splitting is \u03b3 B \u0127.\n\nThe frequency associated with this energy splitting is the Larmor frequency, which is \u03c9 = \u0394E / \u0127 = \u03b3 B. But wait, that's the usual Larmor frequency. However, in this case, the Hamiltonian is along Y, so the precession should be around the Y-axis. But the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the magnetic moment. Hmm, so maybe the frequency is the same as the Larmor frequency?\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expectation value of \u015c_z will oscillate with the Larmor frequency? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to compute the time dependence of \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 explicitly.\n\nLet me consider the initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9. Let me write this in the \u015c_y basis. The eigenstates of \u015c_y are |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9. The state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be expressed as a combination of |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9.\n\nThe eigenstates of \u015c_y are:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9),\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (1/\u221a2)(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9).\n\nTherefore, |\u2191z\u27e9 = (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSo the initial state |\u2191z\u27e9 can be written as a superposition of the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian H', which is proportional to \u015c_y. Therefore, the time evolution of the state will be:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t)|\u2191z\u27e9 = U(t) (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nSince H' acts on |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 as eigenstates, the time evolution operator will multiply each eigenstate by a phase factor. Specifically,\n\nU(t)|\u2191y\u27e9 = exp(-i E_+ t / \u0127)|\u2191y\u27e9,\n\nU(t)|\u2193y\u27e9 = exp(-i E_- t / \u0127)|\u2193y\u27e9,\n\nwhere E_+ and E_- are the eigenvalues of H' for |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9.\n\nEarlier, we found that H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y, so the eigenvalues are E_\u00b1 = -\u03b3 B (\u00b1\u0127/2) = \u2213 \u03b3 B \u0127 / 2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nE_+ (for |\u2191y\u27e9) = -\u03b3 B (\u0127/2),\n\nE_- (for |\u2193y\u27e9) = \u03b3 B (\u0127/2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nU(t)|\u2191y\u27e9 = exp(-i (-\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 ) |\u2191y\u27e9 = exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2191y\u27e9,\n\nU(t)|\u2193y\u27e9 = exp(-i (\u03b3 B \u0127 / 2) t / \u0127 ) |\u2193y\u27e9 = exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2193y\u27e9.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into |\u03c8(t)\u27e9,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9]/\u221a2.\n\nNow, let's express this back in terms of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9. Recall that:\n\n|\u2191y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\n|\u2193y\u27e9 = (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nexp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 = exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nexp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9 = exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nAdding these together:\n\nexp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9 =\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2) (|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)] / \u221a2.\n\nLet me factor out the terms:\n\n= [ (exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)) |\u2191z\u27e9 + i exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193z\u27e9 - i exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193z\u27e9 ] / \u221a2.\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nThe coefficient of |\u2191z\u27e9 is [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)] = 2 cos(\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nThe coefficient of |\u2193z\u27e9 is [i exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) - i exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)] = i [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) - exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)] = i * 2i sin(\u03b3 B t / 2) = -2 sin(\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [2 cos(\u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2191z\u27e9 - 2 sin(\u03b3 B t / 2) |\u2193z\u27e9 ] / (\u221a2 * \u221a2) ?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, actually, the denominator was already divided by \u221a2 from the original expression. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the initial expression after substitution was:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9]/\u221a2,\n\nand then substituting |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 gives:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] / \u221a2.\n\nWait, so that's an extra division by \u221a2. Let me recast that step properly.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nThe first term is exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 divided by \u221a2, and the second term is exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9 divided by \u221a2, and then the entire sum is divided by \u221a2 again? Wait no, actually, the initial expression is:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9]/\u221a2,\n\nsince the original |\u2191z\u27e9 was (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2, and then each term is multiplied by their respective phases, and then divided by \u221a2 again? Wait, no, actually, let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t)|\u2191z\u27e9 = U(t)*(|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2.\n\nThen, U(t)|\u2191y\u27e9 = exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9,\n\nU(t)|\u2193y\u27e9 = exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9,\n\nso substituting,\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9]/\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, when substituting |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9, each term is multiplied by 1/\u221a2, so the total becomes:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] / \u221a2.\n\nWait, no, actually, the first term is exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9, which is exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nand the second term is exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9, which is exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nso adding them together gives:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)] / \u221a2,\n\nand then divided by \u221a2 again? Wait, no, the initial division by \u221a2 is already in the expression for |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9. Therefore, the total expression is:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)] divided by (\u221a2 * \u221a2) ?\n\nWait, no, let me clarify:\n\nThe first term is exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 = exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthe second term is exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9 = exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nso adding them gives:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)] / \u221a2,\n\nand then the entire thing is divided by \u221a2 again because the original |\u2191z\u27e9 was expressed as (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2, so when we apply U(t) to that, we have U(t)*(|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2, so the division by \u221a2 is already accounted for. Wait, actually, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the initial state is |\u2191z\u27e9 = (|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nthen |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = U(t)|\u2191z\u27e9 = U(t)*(|\u2191y\u27e9 + |\u2193y\u27e9)/\u221a2,\n\nso when we apply U(t) to each term, we get:\n\n[ U(t)|\u2191y\u27e9 + U(t)|\u2193y\u27e9 ] / \u221a2,\n\nwhich is [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191y\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193y\u27e9 ] / \u221a2,\n\nthen substituting |\u2191y\u27e9 and |\u2193y\u27e9 in terms of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9,\n\neach of those terms has a 1/\u221a2 factor, so when you substitute, you have:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)/\u221a2 ] / \u221a2,\n\nso that's the same as:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 + i|\u2193z\u27e9) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)*(|\u2191z\u27e9 - i|\u2193z\u27e9)] / ( \u221a2 * \u221a2 )\n\nsince each term inside the brackets has a 1/\u221a2, and then divided by another \u221a2 from the initial division. Therefore, the denominator becomes 2.\n\nTherefore, simplifying numerator:\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\nexp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + i exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193z\u27e9 + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - i exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\ngrouping the |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9 terms:\n\n[exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) + exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)] |\u2191z\u27e9 +\n\n[i exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) - i exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)] |\u2193z\u27e9.\n\nThe coefficients:\n\nFor |\u2191z\u27e9: 2 cos(\u03b3 B t / 2),\n\nFor |\u2193z\u27e9: i [exp(i \u03b3 B t / 2) - exp(-i \u03b3 B t / 2)] = i * 2i sin(\u03b3 B t / 2) = -2 sin(\u03b3 B t / 2).\n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes:\n\n2 cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - 2 sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nand the denominator is 2, so overall:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = [cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193z\u27e9].\n\nWait, that simplifies nicely. So the state at time t is a combination of |\u2191z\u27e9 and |\u2193z\u27e9 with coefficients cos(\u03b3 B t / 2) and -sin(\u03b3 B t / 2). \n\nNow, we need to compute the expectation value of \u015c_z. The operator \u015c_z in the z-basis is diagonal with eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2. Therefore,\n\n\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c8(t)|\u015c_z|\u03c8(t)\u27e9.\n\nLet me compute that. Since |\u03c8(t)\u27e9 is expressed as:\n\n|\u03c8(t)\u27e9 = cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nthe bra is \u27e8\u03c8(t)| = cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)\u27e8\u2191z| - sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)\u27e8\u2193z|.\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 = [cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)\u27e8\u2191z| - sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)\u27e8\u2193z|] \u015c_z [cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)|\u2193z\u27e9].\n\nSince \u015c_z |\u2191z\u27e9 = (+\u0127/2)|\u2191z\u27e9,\n\n\u015c_z |\u2193z\u27e9 = (-\u0127/2)|\u2193z\u27e9,\n\nso substituting,\n\n\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 = cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)\u27e8\u2191z| (+\u0127/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 - cos(\u03b3 B t / 2)\u27e8\u2191z| (-\u0127/2)|\u2193z\u27e9 \n\n- sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)\u27e8\u2193z| (+\u0127/2)|\u2191z\u27e9 + sin(\u03b3 B t / 2)\u27e8\u2193z| (-\u0127/2)|\u2193z\u27e9.\n\nBut \u27e8\u2191z|\u2193z\u27e9 = 0 and \u27e8\u2193z|\u2191z\u27e9 = 0, so the cross terms vanish. The remaining terms are:\n\ncos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2)*(+\u0127/2) + sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2)*(-\u0127/2).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)[cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2) - sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2)].\n\nUsing the double-angle identity, cos\u00b2x - sin\u00b2x = cos(2x), so:\n\n\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of \u015c_z oscillates with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check the math again. Let me compute step by step:\n\n\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)[cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2) - sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2)].\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, cos\u00b2x - sin\u00b2x = cos(2x), so substituting x = \u03b3 B t / 2,\n\n\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t).\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of \u015c_z is oscillating with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. Therefore, the frequency of oscillation is \u03b3 B. But wait, the question asks for the oscillation frequency. The options are given as A. gamma*B/sqrt(2), B. gamma*B/2, C. gamma*B, D. sqrt(2)*gamma*B.\n\nSo according to this calculation, the answer should be C. gamma*B. But let me check again because sometimes there might be a factor I missed.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The time dependence came from the exponentials in the time evolution. The exponent was i \u03b3 B t / 2 and -i \u03b3 B t / 2. The difference between the phases is \u03b3 B t, so the oscillation frequency is related to that. Let me see:\n\nThe expectation value ended up as cos(\u03b3 B t), so the argument of the cosine is \u03b3 B t, so the angular frequency \u03c9 is \u03b3 B. Therefore, the frequency f is \u03c9/(2\u03c0) = \u03b3 B/(2\u03c0), but the question just asks for the oscillation frequency, which is typically the angular frequency in such contexts unless specified otherwise. Since the options are given in terms of gamma*B etc., so the answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check again the steps because sometimes when you have a spin precessing around an axis, the frequency might be different. Let me recall that the Larmor frequency is indeed \u03c9 = \u03b3 B. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the spin precesses around Y with angular frequency \u03b3 B. The component of the spin along Z would then oscillate at that frequency. So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when simplifying the expectation value. Let me recheck that step.\n\nStarting from:\n\n\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 = (\u0127/2)[cos\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2) - sin\u00b2(\u03b3 B t / 2)].\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, cos\u00b2x - sin\u00b2x = cos(2x), so substituting x = \u03b3 B t / 2,\n\ncos(2*(\u03b3 B t / 2)) = cos(\u03b3 B t). So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the expectation value is indeed (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t), so the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the average of the z-component of the particle\u2019s moment starts oscillating\". The magnetic moment \u03bc_z is \u03b3\u015c_z, so \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 = \u03b3\u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9. Since \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 is oscillating as cos(\u03b3 B t), then \u27e8\u03bc_z\u27e9 is proportional to that, so the frequency is the same, \u03b3 B. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the time evolution. Let me think of another approach. Suppose we consider the Hamiltonian H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y. The time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg picture can be used here. The expectation value \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 is equal to \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9_H at time t, where \u015c_z(t) is the Heisenberg operator.\n\nThe Heisenberg equation of motion is d\u015c_z/dt = (1/i\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_z].\n\nCompute the commutator [\u0124', \u015c_z]. Since H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y,\n\n[H', \u015c_z] = -\u03b3 B [\u015c_y, \u015c_z] = -\u03b3 B (i\u0127 \u015c_x).\n\nTherefore,\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (1/i\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)(i\u0127 \u015c_x) = \u03b3 B \u015c_x.\n\nSimilarly, we can write the equation for \u015c_x:\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (1/i\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_x] = (1/i\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)[\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = (1/i\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)(-i\u0127 \u015c_z) = \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nTherefore, we have the system of equations:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_x,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nThis is a system of linear differential equations. Let me write them as:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_x,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nLet me denote S_z(t) = \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 and S_x(t) = \u27e8\u015c_x\u27e9. Then,\n\ndS_z/dt = \u03b3 B S_x,\n\ndS_x/dt = \u03b3 B S_z.\n\nThis is a classic harmonic oscillator system. Let me differentiate the first equation again:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B dS_x/dt = \u03b3 B (\u03b3 B S_z) = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z.\n\nTherefore, the equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z if there's a negative sign missing? Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the second equation is dS_x/dt = \u03b3 B S_z,\n\nso substituting into the first derivative,\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B * (dS_x/dt) = \u03b3 B * (\u03b3 B S_z) = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z.\n\nWait, but that would give d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z, which is a differential equation with solution growing exponentially, which can't be right. That suggests an error in the sign.\n\nWait, let me check the commutator again. The commutator [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] is i\u0127 \u015c_z? Wait, the standard commutator is [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = i\u0127 \u015c_z. Wait, but let me recall the commutators:\n\n[\u015c_x, \u015c_y] = i\u0127 \u015c_z,\n\n[\u015c_y, \u015c_z] = i\u0127 \u015c_x,\n\n[\u015c_z, \u015c_x] = i\u0127 \u015c_y.\n\nTherefore, [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = - [\u015c_x, \u015c_y] = -i\u0127 \u015c_z.\n\nWait, so in the calculation of [\u0124', \u015c_x], since H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y,\n\n[H', \u015c_x] = -\u03b3 B [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 \u015c_z) = i \u03b3 B \u0127 \u015c_z.\n\nTherefore, the equation for d\u015c_x/dt is (1/i\u0127)(i \u03b3 B \u0127 \u015c_z) = \u03b3 B \u015c_z. So that part is correct.\n\nWait, but then proceeding again:\n\ndS_z/dt = \u03b3 B S_x,\n\ndS_x/dt = \u03b3 B S_z,\n\nso differentiating the first equation,\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B dS_x/dt = \u03b3 B (\u03b3 B S_z) = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z,\n\nso the equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z,\n\nwhich is a differential equation with solution S_z(t) = A e^{\u03b3 B t} + B e^{-\u03b3 B t}.\n\nBut that can't be right because expectation values should be bounded. Hmm, so there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait a second, this contradicts the previous result where we found S_z(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t). So clearly, there's an error in the Heisenberg equation approach here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the commutator. Let me recast the equations carefully.\n\nGiven H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y,\n\nthen,\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (1/i\u0127)[H', \u015c_z] = (1/i\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)[\u015c_y, \u015c_z].\n\nCompute [\u015c_y, \u015c_z] = i\u0127 \u015c_x,\n\nso,\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (1/i\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)(i\u0127 \u015c_x) = (1/i\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)(i\u0127)\u015c_x = \u03b3 B \u015c_x.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (1/i\u0127)[H', \u015c_x] = (1/i\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)[\u015c_y, \u015c_x].\n\nNow, [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = - [\u015c_x, \u015c_y] = -i\u0127 \u015c_z,\n\nso,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (1/i\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)(-i\u0127 \u015c_z) = (1/i\u0127)(\u03b3 B i\u0127 \u015c_z) = \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nTherefore, the equations are correct. So the system is:\n\ndS_z/dt = \u03b3 B S_x,\n\ndS_x/dt = \u03b3 B S_z.\n\nThis leads to the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B dS_x/dt = \u03b3 B (\u03b3 B S_z) = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z,\n\nso the equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z,\n\nwhich is a differential equation with solutions growing exponentially. But that contradicts the previous result where we had an oscillating solution. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, but in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture calculation, we found that \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 oscillates as cos(\u03b3 B t). So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Wait a second, in the Heisenberg picture, the equations of motion are correct, but perhaps I need to consider the initial conditions. Let me see.\n\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, at t=0, the state is |\u2191z\u27e9, so \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 at t=0 is +\u0127/2, and \u27e8\u015c_x\u27e9 is zero because |\u2191z\u27e9 has zero expectation for \u015c_x.\n\nTherefore, in the Heisenberg equations, the initial conditions are S_z(0) = \u0127/2, S_x(0) = 0.\n\nSo solving the differential equation d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z with S_z(0) = \u0127/2 and dS_z/dt at t=0 is \u03b3 B S_x(0) = 0.\n\nThe general solution to d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z is S_z(t) = A e^{\u03b3 B t} + B e^{-\u03b3 B t}.\n\nApplying initial conditions:\n\nAt t=0: A + B = \u0127/2,\n\nAt t=0: dS_z/dt = \u03b3 B (A - B) = 0 \u21d2 A = B.\n\nTherefore, A = B = \u0127/4,\n\nso S_z(t) = (\u0127/4)(e^{\u03b3 B t} + e^{-\u03b3 B t}) = (\u0127/2) cosh(\u03b3 B t).\n\nWait, but that's hyperbolic cosine, which grows exponentially, which contradicts the Schr\u00f6dinger picture result of cosine oscillation. There's a problem here.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake in setting up the Heisenberg equations. Wait, but where?\n\nWait, hold on. The equations of motion are correct, but the differential equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z, which is a differential equation for exponential growth, but in reality, the system should be oscillating. Therefore, there must be a sign error in the equations.\n\nWait, let me check the commutators again. Let me recast the problem.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y.\n\nThe Heisenberg equation for \u015c_z is:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (i/\u0127)[H', \u015c_z] = (i/\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)[\u015c_y, \u015c_z].\n\nWait, hold on! The Heisenberg equation is dA/dt = (i/\u0127)[H, A], not (1/i\u0127). I think I messed up the sign here.\n\nAh! That's the mistake. The Heisenberg equation is:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (i/\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_z].\n\nPreviously, I had written it as (1/i\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_z], which is incorrect. The correct factor is (i/\u0127). Let me recast everything with the correct sign.\n\nSo, starting over:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (i/\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_z].\n\nGiven H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y,\n\n[H', \u015c_z] = [-\u03b3 B \u015c_y, \u015c_z] = -\u03b3 B [\u015c_y, \u015c_z].\n\nThe commutator [\u015c_y, \u015c_z] = i\u0127 \u015c_x,\n\nso,\n\n[H', \u015c_z] = -\u03b3 B (i\u0127 \u015c_x).\n\nTherefore,\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (i/\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)(i\u0127 \u015c_x) = (i/\u0127)(-\u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_x) = (i^2 / \u0127)(-\u03b3 B \u0127 \u015c_x) = (-1)(-\u03b3 B \u015c_x) = \u03b3 B \u015c_x.\n\nWait, so that gives the same result as before. Hmm, so the sign is still positive. Wait, let me compute step by step:\n\n(i/\u0127) multiplied by (-\u03b3 B)(i\u0127 \u015c_x):\n\nFirst, (i/\u0127) * (-\u03b3 B) * (i\u0127 \u015c_x) = (i * -\u03b3 B * i \u0127 \u015c_x)/\u0127.\n\nThe \u0127 cancels, so:\n\ni * -\u03b3 B * i \u015c_x = (i^2)(-\u03b3 B) \u015c_x = (-1)(-\u03b3 B) \u015c_x = \u03b3 B \u015c_x.\n\nSo that's correct. So the equation is still d\u015c_z/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_x.\n\nSimilarly, for \u015c_x:\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (i/\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_x] = (i/\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)[\u015c_y, \u015c_x].\n\nThe commutator [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = -i\u0127 \u015c_z,\n\nso,\n\n[H', \u015c_x] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 \u015c_z) = \u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z,\n\ntherefore,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (i/\u0127)(\u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z) = (i^2 / \u0127)(\u03b3 B \u0127 \u015c_z) = (-1)(\u03b3 B \u015c_z).\n\nWait, hold on, here's the mistake! Previously, I had written d\u015c_x/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_z, but actually:\n\nLet me compute again:\n\n[H', \u015c_x] = -\u03b3 B [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 \u015c_z) = \u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z,\n\nso,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (i/\u0127)(\u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z) = (i * \u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z)/\u0127 = (i^2 \u03b3 B \u015c_z) = - \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nAh! There we go. The correct equation is d\u015c_x/dt = - \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nPreviously, I had a sign error here. So the correct system of equations is:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_x,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = - \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nThis is crucial. Now, let's redo the differential equation for S_z(t):\n\nDifferentiate the first equation:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B d\u015c_x/dt = \u03b3 B (- \u03b3 B \u015c_z) = - (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z.\n\nTherefore, the equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z,\n\nwhich is the harmonic oscillator equation with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the solution is S_z(t) = A cos(\u03b3 B t) + B sin(\u03b3 B t).\n\nApplying initial conditions:\n\nAt t=0,\n\nS_z(0) = \u0127/2 = A,\n\ndS_z/dt at t=0 is \u03b3 B S_x(0) = \u03b3 B * 0 = 0,\n\nso the derivative at t=0 is -A \u03b3 B sin(0) + B \u03b3 B cos(0) = B \u03b3 B = 0 \u21d2 B = 0.\n\nTherefore, S_z(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t),\n\nwhich matches the result from the Schr\u00f6dinger picture. Phew! So the correct angular frequency is indeed \u03b3 B, so the answer is C.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B, so the correct answer is option C.\n\nBut let me just recap to ensure I didn't make any other mistakes. The key was realizing that in the Heisenberg equations, the second equation had a negative sign which I initially missed, leading to an inconsistency. After correcting that, both methods agree. The oscillation comes from the cosine term with frequency \u03b3 B, so the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment \\(\\mu = \\gamma \\hat{S}_z\\) initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. The magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then turned on along the +Y direction with the same magnitude \\(B\\). We need to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.\n\n1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian Change**:\n   - The initial state is \\(|\\uparrow z\\rangle\\), the eigenstate of \\(\\hat{S}_z\\).\n   - The new Hamiltonian after the magnetic field is turned on along Y is \\(H' = -\\gamma B \\hat{S}_y\\).\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:\n   - The state \\(|\\uparrow z\\rangle\\) is expressed in the eigenbasis of \\(\\hat{S}_y\\):\n     \\[\n     |\\uparrow z\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow y\\rangle + |\\downarrow y\\rangle)\n     \\]\n   - The time evolution under \\(H'\\) is:\n     \\[\n     |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( e^{i \\gamma B t / 2} |\\uparrow y\\rangle + e^{-i \\gamma B t / 2} |\\downarrow y\\rangle \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Converting back to the \\(z\\)-basis:\n     \\[\n     |\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\cos(\\gamma B t / 2)|\\uparrow z\\rangle - \\sin(\\gamma B t / 2)|\\downarrow z\\rangle\n     \\]\n\n3. **Expectation Value of \\(\\hat{S}_z\\)**:\n   - The expectation value \\(\\langle \\hat{S}_z \\rangle\\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\langle \\hat{S}_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left[ \\cos^2(\\gamma B t / 2) - \\sin^2(\\gamma B t / 2) \\right]\n     \\]\n   - Using the double-angle identity:\n     \\[\n     \\langle \\hat{S}_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\cos(\\gamma B t)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Heisenberg Equations of Motion**:\n   - The equations of motion for \\(\\langle \\hat{S}_z \\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle \\hat{S}_x \\rangle\\) are derived:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d\\langle \\hat{S}_z \\rangle}{dt} = \\gamma B \\langle \\hat{S}_x \\rangle\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d\\langle \\hat{S}_x \\rangle}{dt} = -\\gamma B \\langle \\hat{S}_z \\rangle\n     \\]\n   - Solving these leads to the differential equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^2 \\langle \\hat{S}_z \\rangle}{dt^2} = -(\\gamma B)^2 \\langle \\hat{S}_z \\rangle\n     \\]\n   - The solution confirms the oscillation frequency is \\(\\gamma B\\).\n\nThus, the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle\u2019s magnetic moment is \\(\\boxed{C}\\)."

So the system is:\n\ndS_z/dt = \u03b3 B S_x,\n\ndS_x/dt = \u03b3 B S_z.\n\nThis leads to the second derivative:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B dS_x/dt = \u03b3 B (\u03b3 B S_z) = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z,\n\nso the equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z,\n\nwhich is a differential equation with solutions growing exponentially. But that contradicts the previous result where we had an oscillating solution. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, but in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture calculation, we found that \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 oscillates as cos(\u03b3 B t). So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Wait a second, in the Heisenberg picture, the equations of motion are correct, but perhaps I need to consider the initial conditions. Let me see.\n\nIn the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, at t=0, the state is |\u2191z\u27e9, so \u27e8\u015c_z\u27e9 at t=0 is +\u0127/2, and \u27e8\u015c_x\u27e9 is zero because |\u2191z\u27e9 has zero expectation for \u015c_x.\n\nTherefore, in the Heisenberg equations, the initial conditions are S_z(0) = \u0127/2, S_x(0) = 0.\n\nSo solving the differential equation d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z with S_z(0) = \u0127/2 and dS_z/dt at t=0 is \u03b3 B S_x(0) = 0.\n\nThe general solution to d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z is S_z(t) = A e^{\u03b3 B t} + B e^{-\u03b3 B t}.\n\nApplying initial conditions:\n\nAt t=0: A + B = \u0127/2,\n\nAt t=0: dS_z/dt = \u03b3 B (A - B) = 0 \u21d2 A = B.\n\nTherefore, A = B = \u0127/4,\n\nso S_z(t) = (\u0127/4)(e^{\u03b3 B t} + e^{-\u03b3 B t}) = (\u0127/2) cosh(\u03b3 B t).\n\nWait, but that's hyperbolic cosine, which grows exponentially, which contradicts the Schr\u00f6dinger picture result of cosine oscillation. There's a problem here.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake in setting up the Heisenberg equations. Wait, but where?\n\nWait, hold on. The equations of motion are correct, but the differential equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z, which is a differential equation for exponential growth, but in reality, the system should be oscillating. Therefore, there must be a sign error in the equations.\n\nWait, let me check the commutators again. Let me recast the problem.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y.\n\nThe Heisenberg equation for \u015c_z is:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (i/\u0127)[H', \u015c_z] = (i/\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)[\u015c_y, \u015c_z].\n\nWait, hold on! The Heisenberg equation is dA/dt = (i/\u0127)[H, A], not (1/i\u0127). I think I messed up the sign here.\n\nAh! That's the mistake. The Heisenberg equation is:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (i/\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_z].\n\nPreviously, I had written it as (1/i\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_z], which is incorrect. The correct factor is (i/\u0127). Let me recast everything with the correct sign.\n\nSo, starting over:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (i/\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_z].\n\nGiven H' = -\u03b3 B \u015c_y,\n\n[H', \u015c_z] = [-\u03b3 B \u015c_y, \u015c_z] = -\u03b3 B [\u015c_y, \u015c_z].\n\nThe commutator [\u015c_y, \u015c_z] = i\u0127 \u015c_x,\n\nso,\n\n[H', \u015c_z] = -\u03b3 B (i\u0127 \u015c_x).\n\nTherefore,\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = (i/\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)(i\u0127 \u015c_x) = (i/\u0127)(-\u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_x) = (i^2 / \u0127)(-\u03b3 B \u0127 \u015c_x) = (-1)(-\u03b3 B \u015c_x) = \u03b3 B \u015c_x.\n\nWait, so that gives the same result as before. Hmm, so the sign is still positive. Wait, let me compute step by step:\n\n(i/\u0127) multiplied by (-\u03b3 B)(i\u0127 \u015c_x):\n\nFirst, (i/\u0127) * (-\u03b3 B) * (i\u0127 \u015c_x) = (i * -\u03b3 B * i \u0127 \u015c_x)/\u0127.\n\nThe \u0127 cancels, so:\n\ni * -\u03b3 B * i \u015c_x = (i^2)(-\u03b3 B) \u015c_x = (-1)(-\u03b3 B) \u015c_x = \u03b3 B \u015c_x.\n\nSo that's correct. So the equation is still d\u015c_z/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_x.\n\nSimilarly, for \u015c_x:\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (i/\u0127)[\u0124', \u015c_x] = (i/\u0127)(-\u03b3 B)[\u015c_y, \u015c_x].\n\nThe commutator [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = -i\u0127 \u015c_z,\n\nso,\n\n[H', \u015c_x] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 \u015c_z) = \u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z,\n\ntherefore,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (i/\u0127)(\u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z) = (i^2 / \u0127)(\u03b3 B \u0127 \u015c_z) = (-1)(\u03b3 B \u015c_z).\n\nWait, hold on, here's the mistake! Previously, I had written d\u015c_x/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_z, but actually:\n\nLet me compute again:\n\n[H', \u015c_x] = -\u03b3 B [\u015c_y, \u015c_x] = -\u03b3 B (-i\u0127 \u015c_z) = \u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z,\n\nso,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = (i/\u0127)(\u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z) = (i * \u03b3 B i \u0127 \u015c_z)/\u0127 = (i^2 \u03b3 B \u015c_z) = - \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nAh! There we go. The correct equation is d\u015c_x/dt = - \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nPreviously, I had a sign error here. So the correct system of equations is:\n\nd\u015c_z/dt = \u03b3 B \u015c_x,\n\nd\u015c_x/dt = - \u03b3 B \u015c_z.\n\nThis is crucial. Now, let's redo the differential equation for S_z(t):\n\nDifferentiate the first equation:\n\nd\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = \u03b3 B d\u015c_x/dt = \u03b3 B (- \u03b3 B \u015c_z) = - (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z.\n\nTherefore, the equation is d\u00b2S_z/dt\u00b2 = - (\u03b3 B)^2 S_z,\n\nwhich is the harmonic oscillator equation with angular frequency \u03c9 = \u03b3 B.\n\nTherefore, the solution is S_z(t) = A cos(\u03b3 B t) + B sin(\u03b3 B t).\n\nApplying initial conditions:\n\nAt t=0,\n\nS_z(0) = \u0127/2 = A,\n\ndS_z/dt at t=0 is \u03b3 B S_x(0) = \u03b3 B * 0 = 0,\n\nso the derivative at t=0 is -A \u03b3 B sin(0) + B \u03b3 B cos(0) = B \u03b3 B = 0 \u21d2 B = 0.\n\nTherefore, S_z(t) = (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b3 B t),\n\nwhich matches the result from the Schr\u00f6dinger picture. Phew! So the correct angular frequency is indeed \u03b3 B, so the answer is C.\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency is \u03b3 B, so the correct answer is option C.\n\nBut let me just recap to ensure I didn't make any other mistakes. The key was realizing that in the Heisenberg equations, the second equation had a negative sign which I initially missed, leading to an inconsistency. After correcting that, both methods agree. The oscillation comes from the cosine term with frequency \u03b3 B, so the answer is C.\n\n",
