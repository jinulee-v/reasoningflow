        "question": "You have an interesting drought-resistant cultivar of barley, which, unfortunately, contains an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it impossible to use this cultivar for food purposes. After an extensive investigation, you discover the gene responsible for the synthesis of this compound. This gene consists of five exons and four introns. You decide to use old-school approaches and produce a collection of mutants using EMS chemical mutagen. You sequence a target gene in all mutant lines and discover some changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area. Which of the following mutations will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the cultivar?\n\nIntact gene:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 2:\n5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 3:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\nMutant 4:\n5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019<b>\nA.

        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these mutants probably eliminates the anti-nutritional compound. The question is about a gene in barley that's responsible for making this compound, and they used EMS mutagenesis. The goal is to find a mutation that would stop the gene from working, so the compound isn't produced anymore. \n\nFirst, let me recall that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) typically causes point mutations, usually G to A or C to T transitions because it alkylates guanine, leading to mismatches during replication. But maybe the exact type isn't crucial here; the key is looking at the mutations provided.\n\nThe intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon), so the first exon is important. The mutations are all in the first exon area. The question is which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene's function. \n\nLooking at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene:\n\nIntact: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nMutant 1: \nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\nSo let's compare base by base. Let's write them out:\n\nOriginal first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\n\nLooking at the first few bases:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTC...\nMutant1: ATGTTCTAC...\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\nPosition 1-3: ATG (start codon) is same in both.\n\nPosition 4-6: Original is TTT vs Mutant1's TTC. Wait, let me check again. Wait, maybe I need to align them properly.\n\nWait, perhaps better to write each sequence with numbering. Let me try:\n\nOriginal sequence starting from the beginning:\n\nPositions 1-10: ATGTTTCTCG\nMutant1's first 10: ATGTTCTACG\n\nWait, let's do this step by step. Let me write the original and mutant1 side by side:\n\nOriginal: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\nMutant1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, maybe I need to check each position carefully. Let me write the first part:\n\nOriginal: 5\u2019-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nBreaking down the first part:\n\nLet me write each nucleotide position:\n\n1: A\n2: T\n3: G\n4: T\n5: T\n6: T\n7: C\n8: T\n9: C\n10: G\n11: C\n12: T\n13: G\n14: G\n15: T\n16: A\n17: C\n18: T\n19: T\n20: C\n21: T\n22: G\n23: T\n24: G\n25: G\n26: A\n27: T\n28: G\n29: A\n30: A\n31: C\n32: A\n33: T\n34: A\n35: T\n36: T\n37: T\n38: A\n39: T\n40: T\n41: G\n42: T\n43: C\n44: G\n45: T\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too tedious. Alternatively, perhaps look for where the mutations are.\n\nLooking at Mutant1: The original sequence at some point has a change. Let me see where the first difference is.\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nComparing the first part:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking at the first few letters:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTC...\nMutant1: ATGTTCTAC...\n\nSo the first difference is at position 6? Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions 1-7: A T G T T T C (positions 1-7)\nMutant1: A T G T T T C? Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, perhaps better to look for where the sequences start to differ. Let me write the first part of each:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nLooking at the first 10 nucleotides:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCG (positions 1-10)\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACG (positions 1-10)\n\nSo comparing each:\n\n1: A vs A\n2: T vs T\n3: G vs G\n4: T vs T\n5: T vs T\n6: T vs T (still same)\nWait, position 6 is T in both. Then position 7: Original is C vs Mutant1's T? Wait, let's check:\n\nOriginal's 7th nucleotide is C (position 7)\nMutant1's 7th is T? Wait, let me see:\n\nOriginal: positions 1-10: A T G T T T C T C G (so positions 7 is C, 8 is T, 9 is C, 10 is G)\nMutant1's first 10: A T G T T T C T A C G? Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the mutant1's sequence is:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nOriginal first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo starting from the beginning:\n\nOriginal: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nMutant1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, so the first difference is at position 8? Let me check:\n\nOriginal position 8: T (since positions 1-7 are A T G T T T C, so position 8 is T)\nMutant1's position 8: A?\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nOriginal first 10 nucleotides:\n\n1: A\n\n2: T\n\n3: G\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\nMutant1's first 10:\n\n1: A\n\n2: T\n\n3: G\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T vs A? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me write the mutant1's first part:\n\nMutant1 starts with ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, so after the first 7 nucleotides (ATGTTTC), the next is TACG... Wait, original was TCGCTG... Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the first difference is at position 7? Let me see:\n\nOriginal: positions 1-7: A T G T T T C (positions 1-7)\n\nMutant1: positions 1-7: A T G T T T C (same up to here?)\n\nWait, then position 8:\n\nOriginal: T (position 8)\n\nMutant1: A (position 8?)\n\nWait, let me parse the mutant1's sequence again. The original is:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, so after the first 6 nucleotides (ATGTTT), the next part in original is CTCGCTG... whereas in mutant1 it's TACGCTG...\n\nWait, so after the first 6 (ATGTTT), original is CTCGCTG... but mutant1 is TACGCTG...\n\nSo the 7th nucleotide in original is C, but in mutant1 it's T? Wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal: positions 7: C (since first 6 are ATGTTT, so position 7 is C)\n\nMutant1: after ATGTTT (positions 1-6), the next is T (position7?), then A (position8?), C (position9?), G (position10?), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the first difference is at position 7: original is C, mutant1 is T?\n\nWait, let me write the first 10 nucleotides of each:\n\nOriginal:\n\n1: A\n\n2: T\n\n3: G\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: C\n\n8: T\n\n9: C\n\n10: G\n\nMutant1:\n\n1: A\n\n2: T\n\n3: G\n\n4: T\n\n5: T\n\n6: T\n\n7: T (Wait, original's 7 is C, mutant1's 7 is T?)\n\nWait, no, looking at the mutant1's sequence:\n\nMutant1 starts with ATGTTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, the first 7 nucleotides after ATGTTT (positions 1-6) would be:\n\nOriginal: positions 7-10: C T C G\n\nMutant1: positions 7-10: T A C G\n\nWait, so position 7 in mutant1 is T instead of C (original's C at 7 becomes T in mutant1? That would be a C\u2192T mutation, which is a G\u2192A on the complementary strand, which is typical for EMS.\n\nWait, so the first mutation in mutant1 is at position 7: C\u2192T.\n\nThen position 8: original T vs mutant1 A (so T\u2192A? That would be a C\u2192T on the complementary strand? Wait, but EMS usually causes G\u2192A or C\u2192T transitions. Hmm, maybe multiple mutations here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first difference is at position 7 (C\u2192T), then position 8 (T\u2192A?), but that might be two mutations. Alternatively, maybe the sequence is written differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first difference is at position 6? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for the exact point where the sequences diverge. Let me write the original and mutant1's first parts side by side:\n\nOriginal: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nMutant1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, so after the first 6 nucleotides (ATGTTT), the next part in original is CTCGCTG... whereas mutant1 is TACGCTG...\n\nSo the 7th nucleotide is C (original) vs T (mutant1). Then the 8th is T (original) vs A (mutant1). The 9th is C (original) vs C (mutant1)? Wait, no, mutant1's 9th is G? Wait, let me parse again.\n\nWait, after the first 6 (ATGTTT), the next in mutant1 is TACGCTG...\n\nSo positions 7-12:\n\nOriginal: 7:C, 8:T, 9:C, 10:G, 11:C, 12:T\n\nMutant1: 7:T, 8:A, 9:C, 10:G, 11:C, 12:T?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to write the first 12 nucleotides of each:\n\nOriginal:\n\n1-12: A T G T T T C T C G C T\n\nMutant1:\n\n1-12: A T G T T T C T A C G C T\n\nWait, so original at position 7 is C, mutant1 at 7 is T (so C\u2192T)\n\nPosition 8: original T vs mutant1 A (T\u2192A)\n\nPosition 9: original C vs mutant1 C (same)\n\nPosition 10: original G vs mutant1 G (same)\n\nPosition 11: original C vs mutant1 C (same)\n\nPosition 12: original T vs mutant1 T (same)\n\nWait, so the first two differences are at positions 7 (C\u2192T) and 8 (T\u2192A). That's two mutations in a row? That might be possible with EMS, but maybe it's a single mutation that caused a frameshift? Or maybe I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first difference is at position 7 (C\u2192T) and then position 8 (T\u2192A). So two point mutations. \n\nBut regardless, the key is to see if any of these mutations lead to a premature stop codon, or disrupt the reading frame, or create a stop codon early.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a nonsense mutation (premature stop) or a frameshift.\n\nLooking at Mutant1's first exon, let's see the codons.\n\nThe gene starts with ATG (start codon), so the first codon is ATG (methionine). Then the next codons are:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nTTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...\n\nSo codons:\n\n1: ATG (start)\n2: TTT (Phe)\n3: CTC (Leu)\n4: GCT (Ala)\n5: GGT (Gly)\n6: ACT (Thr)\n7: TCT (Ser)\n8: GTG (Val)\n9: GAT (Asp)\n10: GAA (Glu)\n11: CAT (His)\n12: ATT (Ile)\n13: TAT (Tyr)\n14: TGT (Cys)\n15: CGT (Arg)\n... and so on until TGA stop.\n\nNow, looking at Mutant1's sequence:\n\nThe first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTT ATT GT C... Wait, maybe I need to parse correctly.\n\nWait, let me write the mutant1's sequence after the start codon:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant1 after ATG: TTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, so starting from the first nucleotide after ATG (position 4):\n\nOriginal: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G T...\n\nMutant1: T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T T A T T G T C G C...\n\nWait, so the first codon after ATG is TTT (same as original). Then next codon:\n\nOriginal: TTT (first codon after start), then next is CTC (positions 7-9: C T C)\n\nMutant1: After TTT, the next three nucleotides are TAC (positions 7-9 in mutant1: T A C). Wait, let me parse codons step by step.\n\nStarting from the start codon (positions 1-3: ATG), then the next codons:\n\nMutant1's sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-6: T T T (same as original, so TTT)\n\nPositions 7-9: T A C (since in mutant1, position7 is T, 8 is A, 9 is C)\n\nSo the third codon (original was CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr) in mutant1.\n\nSo codons in mutant1:\n\n1: ATG\n\n2: TTT (Phe)\n\n3: TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu)\n\nThen next codon:\n\nOriginal: positions 10-12: G C T (GCT, Ala)\n\nMutant1: positions 10-12: G C T (same as original? Wait, mutant1's position 10 is G, 11 is C, 12 is T? Let me check:\n\nWait, after the first 9 nucleotides (positions 1-9):\n\nMutant1's first 9: ATGTTTCTAC (positions 1-9?), but maybe I need to track better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to write the entire codons for mutant1 up to where the mutation occurs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that the mutation in mutant1 causes a missense mutation (changing an amino acid) but not a stop codon. So maybe not the best option.\n\nNow, looking at Mutant2:\n\nMutant2's sequence: 5\u2019-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nComparing to original:\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo let's look at the differences.\n\nOriginal first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo after the start codon (ATG), the next nucleotides:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTCGCTG...\n\nMutant2: TTTAAGCTGG...\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nOriginal after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-6: T T T (TTT)\n\n7-9: C T C (CTC)\n\n10-12: G C T (GCT)\n\nMutant2 after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-6: T T T (same as original)\n\n7-9: T A A (TAA) ?\n\nWait, let me parse:\n\nOriginal sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT (codon 2)\n\n7-9: CTC (codon3)\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG:\n\nPositions 4-6: TTT (same)\n\n7-9: TAA (since the mutant2's sequence has \"CTAAGCTGG...\" so positions 7-9 would be TAA?\n\nWait, let me write the first part of mutant2's sequence:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nWait, so after the start codon (positions 1-3: ATG), the next nucleotides:\n\nOriginal: positions 4-6: T T T (TTT)\n\nMutant2: positions 4-6: T T T (same)\n\nThen position7:\n\nOriginal: C (position7)\n\nMutant2: T (position7?)\n\nWait, let me parse the first 10 nucleotides:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo after ATG (positions1-3), the next 7 nucleotides (positions4-10):\n\nT T T C T C G (positions4-10)\n\nMutant2's sequence after ATG:\n\nATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nSo positions4-10:\n\nT T T C T A A (positions4-10: T T T C T A A)\n\nWait, so position7 in mutant2 is T (original was C), position8 is A (original was T?), position9 is A (original was C?), etc.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to write the first 12 nucleotides of mutant2:\n\nMutant2's first part: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...\n\nBreaking down:\n\nPositions1-3: ATG (start)\n\n4-6: T T T (same as original)\n\n7-9: T A A (since after TTT comes TAA?)\n\nWait, original at positions7-9: CTC (positions7-9: C T C)\n\nMutant2 at positions7-9: T A A (TAA)\n\nSo the third codon (positions7-9) in mutant2 is TAA, which is a stop codon!\n\nAh! So in mutant2, the third codon becomes TAA, which is a stop codon. That would truncate the protein early, so the gene product is not made, thus eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. That seems promising.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nOriginal codons after start:\n\n1: ATG\n\n2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\n3: CTC (positions7-9)\n\nMutant2's codons:\n\n1: ATG\n\n2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\n3: TAA (positions7-9)\n\nSo the third codon is a stop codon (TAA). Therefore, the protein would be truncated after the second amino acid (Phe), so the gene is non-functional. That would likely eliminate the compound.\n\nNow, checking other mutants:\n\nMutant3: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo comparing:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3: TTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo the first difference is after the first few nucleotides.\n\nLooking at the first part:\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, so after the start codon (ATG), the next nucleotides:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTC (positions4-9)\n\nMutant3: TTTACG (positions4-9?)\n\nWait, let's parse:\n\nOriginal positions4-9: T T T C T C (TTTCTC)\n\nMutant3 positions4-9: T T T T A C (TTTTAC?)\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nMutant3's sequence after ATG starts with TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo positions4-6: T T T (same as original)\n\nPosition7: T (original was C)\n\nPosition8: A (original was T?)\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me look for a stop codon or frameshift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant3, there's a frameshift. Let's see:\n\nOriginal codons after start:\n\n1: ATG\n\n2: TTT (positions4-6)\n\n3: CTC (positions7-9)\n\nMutant3's codons:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\npositions4-6: TTT (same)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (since mutant3 has T at position7, A at8, C at9?)\n\nWait, if mutant3's sequence after ATG is TTTTACGCTGGT..., then positions7-9 would be TAC (positions7-9: T A C). So codon3 is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then next codon:\n\nOriginal positions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\nMutant3's positions10-12: GCT (same?), but maybe shifted?\n\nWait, perhaps there's an insertion or deletion? Wait, no, it's a point mutation. Wait, the mutant3's sequence seems to have an extra T? Let me check the length.\n\nWait, the original and mutant sequences are all the same length? The question says \"changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area\", so probably point mutations, not indels. So maybe mutant3 has a T inserted? Wait, no, the sequences are written as 5\u2019-... so maybe it's a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, looking at mutant3's sequence:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3: ...TTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, perhaps there's a substitution leading to a frameshift? Let me see:\n\nSuppose in mutant3, there's a substitution that changes a nucleotide, causing a frameshift. For example, if a T is inserted or deleted, but since it's EMS, it's a point mutation. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the first part of mutant3's sequence after the start codon:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3: TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, so after the first three Ts (positions4-6: TTT), the next nucleotides in original are CTC (positions7-9), but in mutant3 it's TAC (positions7-9: T A C). Then next, original has GCT (positions10-12), mutant3 has GCT (positions10-12: G C T?), but then after that, there's a GTGTCA... which might be a frameshift?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a substitution causing a frameshift. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps in mutant3, there's a substitution that changes a nucleotide, leading to a frameshift. For example, if a T is changed to something else, but without knowing the exact mutation, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the mutation causes a premature stop codon further along?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation in mutant3 is a nonsense mutation later on. But without seeing the exact codons, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the key is that mutant3 has a frameshift. Let me see:\n\nSuppose in mutant3, there's a substitution that changes a nucleotide in a way that shifts the reading frame. For example, if a nucleotide is inserted or deleted, but since it's EMS, it's a point mutation. Wait, but point mutations can't cause frameshifts unless they are insertions or deletions, which EMS doesn't do. So maybe it's a missense mutation but not a stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant3 has a mutation that creates a stop codon later. Let me see:\n\nLooking further in mutant3's sequence:\n\nOriginal after the first part: ...CTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3: ...CTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo after the initial part, there's a change from ACTTCT to GTCACT. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: ACT TCT (positions16-18: ACT, 19-21: TCT)\n\nMutant3: GTG TCA (positions16-18: GTG, 19-21: TCA)\n\nSo that's a frameshift? Wait, no, because it's a substitution. Wait, unless there's an insertion or deletion. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the mutation is a substitution that leads to a stop codon later. But without seeing the entire sequence, it's hard. Maybe mutant3 doesn't have a stop codon early, so it might not be the best choice.\n\nNow, mutant4: 5\u2019-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT\u2026TGA-3\u2019\n\nOriginal: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo comparing:\n\nOriginal after ATG: TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4: TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo the first part:\n\nOriginal: TTTCTC (positions4-9)\n\nMutant4: TTTTAC (positions4-9?)\n\nWait, let's parse:\n\nMutant4's sequence after ATG starts with TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo positions4-6: TTT (same as original)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (T A C)\n\nOriginal positions7-9: CTC (C T C)\n\nSo codon3 is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then next codon:\n\nOriginal positions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\nMutant4's positions10-12: GCT (same?)\n\nWait, but then after that, mutant4 has ACT instead of GGT?\n\nWait, original after GCT (positions10-12) is GGT (positions13-15: G G T)\n\nMutant4's sequence after GCT is ACT (positions13-15: A C T). So that's a change from GGT to ACT. So codon4 becomes ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). \n\nContinuing, the next codon in original is ACT (positions16-18: A C T), but mutant4 has TCT (positions16-18: T C T?) Wait, maybe I need to track further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant4 has a frameshift? Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps there's a deletion or insertion? The question says \"changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area\", so maybe it's a point mutation. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the first part of mutant4's sequence:\n\nOriginal: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant4: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, so after the first few nucleotides, there's a change from CTGGTACT to CGCTACT. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant4 has a mutation that causes a stop codon later. Let me see:\n\nLooking further in mutant4's sequence, after the initial changes, does it have a stop codon?\n\nOriginal has a stop codon at the end (TGA). If the mutation causes an earlier stop, that would be good. Let me see:\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence after the first part:\n\n...ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, the original had TGA as the stop, but in mutant4, maybe there's a TGA earlier?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant4, the codons after the mutation lead to a stop. Let me try to parse codons for mutant4:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nATG (start)\n\npositions4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\npositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\npositions13-15: ACT (Thr)\n\npositions16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\npositions19-21: GTG (Val)\n\npositions22-24: GAT (Asp)\n\npositions25-27: GAA (Glu)\n\npositions28-30: CAT (His)\n\npositions31-33: ATT (Ile)\n\npositions34-36: TAT (Tyr)\n\npositions37-39: TGT (Cys)\n\npositions40-42: TCG (Ser)\n\nWait, but in mutant4's sequence, after the first part, the codons might be altered. Let me see:\n\nWait, mutant4's sequence after the first part (after the start codon):\n\nTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\n1: TTT (Phe)\n\n2: TAC (Tyr)\n\n3: GCT (Ala)\n\n4: ACT (Thr)\n\n5: TCT (Ser)\n\n6: GTG (Val)\n\n7: GAT (Asp)\n\n8: GAA (Glu)\n\n9: CAT (His)\n\n10: ATT (Ile)\n\n11: TAT (Tyr)\n\n12: TGT (Cys)\n\n13: TCG (Ser)\n\n... and so on until the stop codon.\n\nWait, so no stop codon introduced here. So mutant4's protein is still being made, just with some amino acid changes. So that might not eliminate the compound.\n\nNow, going back to mutant2, which had a stop codon at the third codon (TAA), that would definitely truncate the protein early, so the gene is non-functional. That's a strong candidate.\n\nMutant1 had a missense mutation (changing Leu to Tyr in the third codon), but the protein continues, so the gene might still be functional, just a different amino acid. That might not eliminate the compound.\n\nMutant3 and 4 also have missense mutations but no early stop. So the best answer is mutant2 (option B) because it introduces a stop codon early, knocking out the gene.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts gene function, such as introducing a premature stop codon or causing a frameshift.\n\n### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:\n1. **Mutant 1**:\n   - **Mutation**: Changes nucleotides at positions 7\u20139 from **CTC** (Leu) to **TAC** (Tyr).\n   - **Effect**: A missense mutation altering an amino acid but not introducing a stop codon. The protein continues to be synthesized, so the gene remains functional. **Unlikely to eliminate the compound**.\n\n2. **Mutant 2**:\n   - **Mutation**: Changes nucleotides at positions 7\u20139 from **CTC** (Leu) to **TAA** (stop codon).\n   - **Effect**: Introduces a premature stop codon at the third codon. This truncates the protein early, rendering the gene non-functional. **Highly likely to eliminate the compound**.\n\n3. **Mutant 3**:\n   - **Mutation**: Introduces substitutions altering codons but no premature stop codon. For example, changes **CTC** (Leu) to **TAC** (Tyr) and **GGT** (Gly) to **GTG** (Val).\n   - **Effect**: Missense mutations but no disruption of the reading frame or premature stop. The protein is still produced, so the gene remains functional. **Unlikely to eliminate the compound**.\n\n4. **Mutant 4**:\n   - **Mutation**: Introduces substitutions altering codons (e.g., **CTC** \u2192 **TAC**, **GGT** \u2192 **ACT**), but no premature stop codon.\n   - **Effect**: Missense mutations without truncation. The protein continues to be synthesized, so the gene remains functional. **Unlikely to eliminate the compound**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) at the third codon, halting protein synthesis early. This mutation effectively disrupts gene function, making it the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Answer: B. Mutant 2**"

Let me see:\n\nSuppose in mutant3, there's a substitution that changes a nucleotide in a way that shifts the reading frame. For example, if a nucleotide is inserted or deleted, but since it's EMS, it's a point mutation. Wait, but point mutations can't cause frameshifts unless they are insertions or deletions, which EMS doesn't do. So maybe it's a missense mutation but not a stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant3 has a mutation that creates a stop codon later. Let me see:\n\nLooking further in mutant3's sequence:\n\nOriginal after the first part: ...CTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nMutant3: ...CTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nSo after the initial part, there's a change from ACTTCT to GTCACT. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: ACT TCT (positions16-18: ACT, 19-21: TCT)\n\nMutant3: GTG TCA (positions16-18: GTG, 19-21: TCA)\n\nSo that's a frameshift? Wait, no, because it's a substitution. Wait, unless there's an insertion or deletion. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the mutation is a substitution that leads to a stop codon later. But without seeing the entire sequence, it's hard. Maybe mutant3 doesn't have a stop codon early, so it might not be the best choice.\n\n",

Then next codon:\n\nOriginal positions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\nMutant4's positions10-12: GCT (same?)\n\nWait, but then after that, mutant4 has ACT instead of GGT?\n\nWait, original after GCT (positions10-12) is GGT (positions13-15: G G T)\n\nMutant4's sequence after GCT is ACT (positions13-15: A C T). So that's a change from GGT to ACT. So codon4 becomes ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). \n\nContinuing, the next codon in original is ACT (positions16-18: A C T), but mutant4 has TCT (positions16-18: T C T?)

Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe mutant4 has a mutation that causes a stop codon later. Let me see:\n\nLooking further in mutant4's sequence, after the initial changes, does it have a stop codon?\n\nOriginal has a stop codon at the end (TGA). If the mutation causes an earlier stop, that would be good. Let me see:\n\nLooking at mutant4's sequence after the first part:\n\n...ACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nWait, the original had TGA as the stop, but in mutant4, maybe there's a TGA earlier?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in mutant4, the codons after the mutation lead to a stop. Let me try to parse codons for mutant4:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nATG (start)\n\npositions4-6: TTT (Phe)\n\npositions7-9: TAC (Tyr)\n\npositions10-12: GCT (Ala)\n\npositions13-15: ACT (Thr)\n\npositions16-18: TCT (Ser)\n\npositions19-21: GTG (Val)\n\npositions22-24: GAT (Asp)\n\npositions25-27: GAA (Glu)\n\npositions28-30: CAT (His)\n\npositions31-33: ATT (Ile)\n\npositions34-36: TAT (Tyr)\n\npositions37-39: TGT (Cys)\n\npositions40-42: TCG (Ser)\n\nWait, but in mutant4's sequence, after the first part, the codons might be altered. Let me see:\n\nWait, mutant4's sequence after the first part (after the start codon):\n\nTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...\n\nBreaking into codons:\n\nAfter ATG:\n\n1: TTT (Phe)\n\n2: TAC (Tyr)\n\n3: GCT (Ala)\n\n4: ACT (Thr)\n\n5: TCT (Ser)\n\n6: GTG (Val)\n\n7: GAT (Asp)\n\n8: GAA (Glu)\n\n9: CAT (His)\n\n10: ATT (Ile)\n\n11: TAT (Tyr)\n\n12: TGT (Cys)\n\n13: TCG (Ser)\n\n... and so on until the stop codon.\n\nWait, so no stop codon introduced here.

            "text": "Mutant3 and 4 also have missense mutations but no early stop. So the best answer is mutant2 (option B) because it introduces a stop codon early, knocking out the gene.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts gene function, such as introducing a premature stop codon or causing a frameshift.\n\n### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:\n1. **Mutant 1**:\n   - **Mutation**: Changes nucleotides at positions 7\u20139 from **CTC** (Leu) to **TAC** (Tyr).\n   - **Effect**: A missense mutation altering an amino acid but not introducing a stop codon. The protein continues to be synthesized, so the gene remains functional. **Unlikely to eliminate the compound**.\n\n2. **Mutant 2**:\n   - **Mutation**: Changes nucleotides at positions 7\u20139 from **CTC** (Leu) to **TAA** (stop codon).\n   - **Effect**: Introduces a premature stop codon at the third codon. This truncates the protein early, rendering the gene non-functional. **Highly likely to eliminate the compound**.\n\n3. **Mutant 3**:\n   - **Mutation**: Introduces substitutions altering codons but no premature stop codon. For example, changes **CTC** (Leu) to **TAC** (Tyr) and **GGT** (Gly) to **GTG** (Val).\n   - **Effect**: Missense mutations but no disruption of the reading frame or premature stop. The protein is still produced, so the gene remains functional. **Unlikely to eliminate the compound**.\n\n4. **Mutant 4**:\n   - **Mutation**: Introduces substitutions altering codons (e.g., **CTC** \u2192 **TAC**, **GGT** \u2192 **ACT**), but no premature stop codon.\n   - **Effect**: Missense mutations without truncation. The protein continues to be synthesized, so the gene remains functional. **Unlikely to eliminate the compound**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) at the third codon, halting protein synthesis early. This mutation effectively disrupts gene function, making it the most likely candidate to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.\n\n**Answer: B. Mutant 2**",
