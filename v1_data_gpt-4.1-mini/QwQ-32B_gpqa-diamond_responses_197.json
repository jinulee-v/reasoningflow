        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The problem gives me the total cobalt concentration as 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, and \u03b24=16. The options are A through D, with percentages given. \n\nFirst, I should recall that cobalt(II) can form complexes with thiocyanate ions (SCN-). The stability constants (\u03b2) given are for the formation of the complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 thiocyanate ions, respectively. The blue complex is probably the dithiocyanato one, which would be the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex, right? Because the question mentions \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II)\", so that's the Co^2+ with two SCN- ligands. \n\nThe problem is asking for the percentage of this species among all cobalt-containing species. To find this, I need to calculate the concentrations of all possible cobalt species and then find the fraction that is Co(SCN)2^2+.\n\nThe species present in solution would be:\n\n1. Free Co^2+ ions (Co^2+)\n2. Monothiocyanato complex: Co(SCN)^+\n3. Dithiocyanato complex: Co(SCN)2^2+ (this is the blue one)\n4. Trithiocyanato complex: Co(SCN)3^-\n5. Tetrathiocyanato complex: Co(SCN)4^2-\n\nThe stability constants \u03b21 to \u03b24 correspond to the formation of these complexes. The general formula for the stability constant \u03b2n is:\n\n\u03b2n = [Co(SCN)n^(2\u2212n)] / ([Co^2+][SCN-]^n)\n\nSo, for each complex, the concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN-]. However, since the total concentration of cobalt is given, we can use the total concentration to set up an equation.\n\nLet me denote the concentration of free Co^2+ as x. Then, the concentrations of the complexes can be written as:\n\n[Co(SCN)^+] = \u03b21 * x * [SCN-]\n\n[Co(SCN)2^2+] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = \u03b23 * x * [SCN-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2-] = \u03b24 * x * [SCN-]^4\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all these species:\n\nc(Co) = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)2^2+] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]\n\nPlugging in the expressions in terms of x:\n\nc(Co) = x + \u03b21 x [SCN-] + \u03b22 x [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 x [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 x [SCN-]^4\n\nWe can factor out x:\n\nc(Co) = x [1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4]\n\nTherefore, solving for x:\n\nx = c(Co) / [1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4]\n\nOnce we have x, we can compute the concentration of each complex. The question asks specifically for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2), which is [Co(SCN)2^2+] = \u03b22 x [SCN-]^2.\n\nTherefore, the fraction would be:\n\n([Co(SCN)2^2+] / c(Co)) * 100% = (\u03b22 x [SCN-]^2 / c(Co)) * 100%\n\nBut since x = c(Co) / denominator, substituting that in:\n\nFraction = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) * 100%\n\nWhere denominator is 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4\n\nSo, let me plug in the numbers given:\n\nc(Co) = 1e-2 M (but actually, since we are dealing with fractions, maybe the actual value cancels out?)\n\nWait, but let me check the given values:\n\nTotal cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M. The [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The \u03b2 values are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nSo, let me compute the denominator first:\n\nDenominator = 1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b24 [SCN-]^4\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: \u03b21 [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\nThird term: \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 = 40 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.01 = 0.4\n\nFourth term: \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 = 63 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.001 = 0.063\n\nFifth term: \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 = 16 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nAdding all these up:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 \u2248 2.3646\n\nSo denominator \u2248 2.3646\n\nTherefore, the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is:\n\n\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 \u2248 (0.4) / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691\n\nMultiply by 100% gives approximately 16.91%, which is close to option A (16.9%). But wait, the options include 16.9% as A, but let me check again because maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recalculate the denominator step by step to be precise.\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 \u2192 total so far: 1.9\n\nThird term: 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4 \u2192 total: 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\nFourth term: 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 = 0.063 \u2192 total: 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\nFifth term: 16*(0.1)^4 = 16*0.0001 = 0.0016 \u2192 total: 2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nYes, that's correct. So denominator is 2.3646.\n\nThen, the numerator for the fraction of Co(SCN)2^2+ is \u03b22*(SCN-)^2 = 40*(0.1)^2 = 0.4.\n\nSo 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is indeed approximately 0.1691, so 16.91%, which is option A. But wait, the options given are A.16.9%, B.42.3%, C.38.1%, D.25.6%. So A is 16.9%, which matches. But wait, the problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\".\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me confirm if the dithiocyanato complex is indeed the one with two SCN- ligands. The question says \"dithiocyanato\", which is di-, so two. So that's correct. The formula would be Co(SCN)2^2+, which is the second complex. So the calculation seems right.\n\nBut let me check if I might have confused the stability constants. The problem states the stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b21 is for the first complex (1 SCN-), \u03b22 for the second (2 SCN-), etc. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the charge? Wait, but the stability constants are given, so the formula should be correct. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Let me re-express the fraction again.\n\nThe fraction is [Co(SCN)2^2+] / c_total(Co). Since c_total(Co) is 0.01 M, but in the calculation above, when we compute the fraction, the c(Co) cancels out because:\n\nFraction = (\u03b22 x [SCN-]^2) / c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) * (x / c(Co)) * c(Co) / c(Co) ?\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The total concentration is c(Co) = x * denominator, so x = c(Co)/denominator. Then, [Co(SCN)2^2+] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN-]^2 = \u03b22 * (c(Co)/denominator) * [SCN-]^2. Therefore, the fraction is [Co(SCN)2^2+]/c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator). So that's correct. So the c(Co) cancels out, so the fraction is indeed (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/denominator. So that's 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691, so 16.9%, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options have B as 42.3%, which is higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the denominator?\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again step by step:\n\nDenominator = 1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4\n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16, [SCN-]=0.1 M.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) \u03b21[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n3) \u03b22[SCN-]^2 = 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4\n\n4) \u03b23[SCN-]^3 = 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 = 0.063\n\n5) \u03b24[SCN-]^4 = 16*(0.1)^4 = 16*0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nYes, that's correct. So denominator is 2.3646. Then \u03b22[SCN-]^2 is 0.4, so 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691, so 16.9%. So that's answer A. But the options include A as 16.9%, so that's correct. Hmm. But why is the option B 42.3%? Maybe I made a mistake in the stability constants?\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again. It says \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So \u03b21 is for the first complex (1 SCN-), \u03b22 for the second (2 SCN-), etc. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the charge of the complex? For example, maybe the blue complex is actually the trithiocyanato complex? Wait, but the question says \"dithiocyanato\", which is two. Alternatively, maybe the stability constants are given in a different order? Wait, sometimes stability constants can be given as log \u03b2, but here they are given as \u03b2 directly. The problem states \"stability constants\", so they are the actual \u03b2 values, not log values. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider activity coefficients? But the problem doesn't mention that, so probably not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Let me think again. The fraction is [Co(SCN)2^2+] divided by the total cobalt concentration. Since the total cobalt is 0.01 M, but in the calculation above, the fraction is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/denominator, which is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169, so 16.9%. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the total concentration of SCN-? Wait, but the problem states that [SCN-] is 0.1 M. But in reality, when complexes form, the free SCN- concentration would be lower. Wait a second! Wait, hold on. This is a critical point. \n\nI think I made a mistake here. The given [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but that's the total concentration of SCN-? Or is that the free SCN- concentration? The problem says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". Typically, in such problems, unless stated otherwise, the given concentrations are the total concentrations. Therefore, the total SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, but when complexes form, the free SCN- concentration is lower. Therefore, my previous approach is incorrect because I assumed that [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but actually, the free [SCN-] is less than 0.1 M. \n\nOh no! That complicates things. I need to consider that the total SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, so:\n\nTotal SCN- = [SCN-]free + [Co(SCN)^+] + 2[Co(SCN)2^2+] + 3[Co(SCN)3^-] + 4[Co(SCN)4^2-]\n\nTherefore, the free [SCN-] is not 0.1 M, but less. Therefore, my previous calculation is wrong because I used 0.1 M as the free SCN- concentration, but actually, the free SCN- is an unknown variable here. \n\nThis is a more complex problem. I need to set up equations considering both the total cobalt and total SCN- concentrations. \n\nLet me start over with this in mind.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n[Co^2+] = x\n\nThen,\n\n[Co(SCN)^+] = \u03b21 x [SCN-]free\n\n[Co(SCN)2^2+] = \u03b22 x [SCN-]free^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = \u03b23 x [SCN-]free^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2-] = \u03b24 x [SCN-]free^4\n\nTotal cobalt concentration:\n\nc(Co) = x + \u03b21 x [SCN-]free + \u03b22 x [SCN-]free^2 + \u03b23 x [SCN-]free^3 + \u03b24 x [SCN-]free^4 = 0.01 M\n\nTotal SCN- concentration:\n\nTotal SCN- = [SCN-]free + \u03b21 x [SCN-]free + 2 \u03b22 x [SCN-]free^2 + 3 \u03b23 x [SCN-]free^3 + 4 \u03b24 x [SCN-]free^4 = 0.1 M\n\nSo now we have two equations with two variables: x and [SCN-]free. \n\nThis is a system of nonlinear equations, which might be tricky to solve analytically. Maybe we can make an approximation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the free SCN- concentration is approximately equal to the total SCN- concentration? But given that the stability constants are not extremely large, maybe that's not a good approximation. Let me check the stability constants.\n\nLooking at the \u03b2 values:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nThese are not extremely large, so the complexes might not be too dominant. Let me see:\n\nIf we assume that the free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M, then the previous calculation gives 16.9%, which is option A. But since the problem gives an option B as 42.3%, which is higher, perhaps the assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the question actually does consider the free SCN- as 0.1 M, but that would be incorrect because the total SCN- is 0.1 M. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is formulated such that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration? The problem says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". If that is the free concentration, then my first calculation is correct. But in most cases, when a problem states the concentration of a ligand, it refers to the total concentration. \n\nHmm, this is a critical point. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M.\"\n\nThe wording says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". The square brackets usually denote free ion concentration, but sometimes they can mean total. Hmm. This is ambiguous. \n\nIn analytical chemistry, when they give concentrations like [SCN-], it's often the total concentration unless specified otherwise. But in some contexts, especially in problems where you have to consider complexation, they might specify whether it's free or total. Since the problem mentions \"total cobalt concentration\", maybe \"total SCN- concentration\" is also implied here. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the total SCN- is 0.1 M, so we have to set up the two equations as above. \n\nThis complicates things, but let's try to proceed.\n\nLet me denote [SCN-]free as y. Then, the equations become:\n\nEquation 1 (total Co):\n\nx (1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074) = 0.01\n\nEquation 2 (total SCN-):\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 x y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 x y\u2074 = 0.1\n\nWe can substitute x from Equation 1 into Equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\nx = 0.01 / [1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074]\n\nPlugging into Equation 2:\n\ny + \u03b21 * [0.01 / D] * y + 2 \u03b22 * [0.01 / D] * y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 * [0.01 / D] * y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 * [0.01 / D] * y\u2074 = 0.1\n\nWhere D = 1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074\n\nMultiply both sides by D:\n\ny D + \u03b21 * 0.01 y + 2 \u03b22 * 0.01 y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 * 0.01 y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 * 0.01 y\u2074 = 0.1 D\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Maybe we can make an approximation here. Let me see if the complexes are not too dominant, so that y \u2248 0.1 M. Let's test this assumption.\n\nIf y \u2248 0.1, then let's compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of Equation 2 with y=0.1.\n\nFirst compute D when y=0.1:\n\nD = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed before: 2.3646\n\nThen, LHS of Equation 2:\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 x y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 x y\u2074\n\nFirst compute x when y=0.1:\n\nx = 0.01 / D \u2248 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.004228 M\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term: y = 0.1\n\nSecond term: \u03b21 x y = 9 * 0.004228 * 0.1 \u2248 9 * 0.0004228 \u2248 0.003805\n\nThird term: 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 = 2 *40 *0.004228*(0.1)^2 = 80 *0.004228*0.01 \u2248 80 *0.00004228 \u2248 0.003382\n\nFourth term: 3 \u03b23 x y\u00b3 = 3*63 *0.004228*(0.1)^3 \u2248 189 *0.004228*0.001 \u2248 189 *0.000004228 \u2248 0.000798\n\nFifth term: 4 \u03b24 x y\u2074 =4*16 *0.004228*(0.1)^4 \u2248 64 *0.004228*0.0001 \u2248 64 *0.0000004228 \u2248 0.000027\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n0.1 + 0.003805 + 0.003382 + 0.000798 + 0.000027 \u2248 \n\n0.1 + 0.003805 = 0.103805\n\n+0.003382 = 0.107187\n\n+0.000798 = 0.107985\n\n+0.000027 \u2248 0.108012\n\nThe RHS of Equation 2 is 0.1 * D \u2248 0.1 * 2.3646 \u2248 0.23646\n\nBut LHS \u2248 0.108 vs RHS \u2248 0.236. So the LHS is much smaller than RHS. Therefore, the assumption that y \u22480.1 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the free SCN- concentration must be lower than 0.1 M. Hmm. So this approach is not working. Maybe we need to make another approximation. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominant species are the lower complexes? Let me see the stability constants. The \u03b2 values increase up to \u03b23=63, then \u03b24=16. So the highest stability constant is \u03b23=63 for the trithiocyanato complex. So maybe the trithiocyanato complex is the most stable, but since the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is not extremely high, maybe the second complex is the most abundant?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume that the free SCN- is much lower than 0.1, so that higher order terms can be neglected? Let me see.\n\nSuppose that y is small, so that y^3 and y^4 terms are negligible. Then, the equations simplify.\n\nLet me try that approximation. Let me assume that y is small, so that terms with y^3 and y^4 can be neglected. Then:\n\nEquation 1 becomes:\n\nx (1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2) \u2248 0.01\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 \u2248 0.1\n\nLet me see if this approximation holds.\n\nFirst, let me try to solve these approximate equations.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\nx \u2248 0.01 / [1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2]\n\nPlugging into Equation 2:\n\ny + \u03b21*(0.01 / (1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2)) * y + 2 \u03b22*(0.01 / (1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2)) * y\u00b2 \u2248 0.1\n\nThis is still complicated, but maybe we can make another approximation. Let me suppose that \u03b21 y and \u03b22 y\u00b2 are small compared to 1. Let me see:\n\nIf y is small, say y \u2248 0.01, then \u03b21 y = 9*0.01 = 0.09, which is not negligible compared to 1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe y is around 0.05?\n\nWait, let me try trial and error. Let me suppose that y is 0.05.\n\nCompute D (denominator in Equation 1):\n\nD = 1 + 9*0.05 + 40*(0.05)^2 + 63*(0.05)^3 + 16*(0.05)^4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1 = 1\n\n9*0.05 = 0.45\n\n40*(0.0025) = 0.1\n\n63*(0.000125) \u2248 0.007875\n\n16*(0.00000625) \u2248 0.0001\n\nAdding up: 1 + 0.45 = 1.45; +0.1 = 1.55; +0.007875 \u22481.557875; +0.0001\u22481.557975\n\nSo D \u22481.558\n\nThen x = 0.01 / 1.558 \u22480.00642 M\n\nNow compute LHS of Equation 2:\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 x y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 x y\u2074\n\nFirst term: 0.05\n\nSecond term: 9 *0.00642 *0.05 \u22489*0.000321\u22480.00289\n\nThird term: 2*40 *0.00642*(0.05)^2 =80 *0.00642*0.0025\u224880*0.00001605\u22480.001284\n\nFourth term: 3*63 *0.00642*(0.05)^3\u2248189 *0.00642*0.000125\u2248189*0.0000008025\u22480.0001516\n\nFifth term:4*16 *0.00642*(0.05)^4\u224864 *0.00642*0.00000625\u224864*0.0000000401\u22480.00000257\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n0.05 +0.00289 =0.05289\n\n+0.001284\u22480.054174\n\n+0.0001516\u22480.0543256\n\n+0.00000257\u22480.054328\n\nThe RHS of Equation 2 is 0.1 * D \u22480.1 *1.558\u22480.1558\n\nBut LHS is 0.0543 vs RHS 0.1558. Still not close. So y=0.05 is too low.\n\nHmm. Let me try y=0.08.\n\nCompute D:\n\n1 +9*0.08 +40*(0.08)^2 +63*(0.08)^3 +16*(0.08)^4\n\nCalculations:\n\n1 + 0.72 +40*(0.0064)=0.256 +63*(0.000512)=0.032256 +16*(0.0004096)=0.0065536\n\nAdding up:\n\n1 +0.72=1.72\n\n+0.256=1.976\n\n+0.032256\u22482.008256\n\n+0.0065536\u22482.0148\n\nSo D\u22482.0148\n\nx=0.01 /2.0148\u22480.004965 M\n\nNow compute LHS of Equation 2:\n\ny=0.08\n\nFirst term:0.08\n\nSecond term:9*0.004965*0.08\u22489*0.0003972\u22480.003575\n\nThird term:2*40*0.004965*(0.08)^2=80*0.004965*0.0064\u224880*0.00003178\u22480.002542\n\nFourth term:3*63*0.004965*(0.08)^3\u2248189*0.004965*0.000512\u2248189*0.00000254\u22480.000481\n\nFifth term:4*16*0.004965*(0.08)^4\u224864*0.004965*0.0004096\u224864*0.00000203\u22480.000130\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n0.08 +0.003575\u22480.083575\n\n+0.002542\u22480.086117\n\n+0.000481\u22480.086598\n\n+0.000130\u22480.086728\n\nRHS is 0.1 * D \u22480.1 *2.0148\u22480.20148\n\nStill LHS (0.0867) is less than RHS (0.2015). Hmm. \n\nTrying y=0.1 gives LHS\u22480.108 vs RHS\u22480.236. \n\nWait, perhaps y is higher than 0.1? But the total SCN- is 0.1 M, so free SCN- can't be higher than that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me think differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the free SCN- is 0.1 M, so the initial calculation is correct, and the answer is A. But why is option B there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the charge of the complex? For example, the blue complex might be the trithiocyanato complex? Let me check the color of cobalt complexes with SCN-.\n\nWait, actually, cobalt(II) thiocyanate complexes can have different colors depending on the number of ligands. For example, Co(SCN)4^2- is reported to be blue, while Co(SCN)2^2+ might be a different color. Wait, maybe I got the complex wrong?\n\nLet me check: \n\nCobalt(II) complexes with thiocyanate. \n\nAccording to some sources, the Co(II) thiocyanate complexes can form up to four SCN- ligands. The color of the complexes can vary. For instance, the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2^2+) might be green or another color, while the tetrathiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)4^2-) is blue. \n\nWait, if that's the case, then the blue complex is actually the tetrathiocyanato one (n=4), not the dithiocyanato (n=2). That would change everything. \n\nThe question says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\". If \"dithiocyanato\" refers to two SCN-, but the blue one is actually the tetra, then there's a mistake in the question or my knowledge. Alternatively, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is blue. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to confirm the color. \n\nLooking up: \n\nCobalt(II) thiocyanate complexes. \n\nUpon a quick search, I find that Co(SCN)4^2- is indeed a blue complex, while lower complexes may be different colors. For example, Co(SCN)2^2+ might be green or yellow. \n\nIf that's the case, then the question might have a mistake, or perhaps I misread it. The question says \"dithiocyanato\", which is two, but if the blue one is the tetra, then the answer would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook where they define the dithiocyanato complex as blue. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I need to proceed with the initial assumption that the dithiocyanato is blue, but then the answer would be A. However, given that the options include a higher percentage, maybe the free SCN- is lower, so the fraction is higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the stability constants are given as log \u03b2 instead of \u03b2? Let me check the problem statement again: \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". It says \"stability constants\", which are usually given as \u03b2 (not log \u03b2). So that's probably not the issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different definition for \u03b2. Sometimes \u03b2 is defined as the formation constant, which is the same as the stability constant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, so the free SCN- is lower, but the problem is designed so that the approximation with free SCN-=0.1 is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where they expect the first approach, assuming free SCN- is 0.1, so the answer is A. But since the options have B as 42%, which is higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator calculation. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the denominator with the given \u03b2 values again:\n\nDenominator = 1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4\n\nPlugging in \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16, [SCN-]=0.1:\n\n1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001)\n\nCalculates to:\n\n1 + 0.9 =1.9\n\n+0.4 =2.3\n\n+0.063=2.363\n\n+0.0016=2.3646\n\nYes, that's correct. So the fraction is 0.4 /2.3646\u22480.169, so 16.9%, which is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the blue complex among all species, but including SCN-? Wait, no, the question says \"among all cobalt containing species\". So only the cobalt species. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stability constants order. Maybe \u03b21 corresponds to the tetra complex? Wait, no, the problem says \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". Typically, \u03b21 is for the first complex (1 ligand), \u03b22 for the second (2 ligands), etc. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in terms of the charge? For example, the blue complex might be the one with charge -2, which would be the tetra (since Co^2+ with four SCN- would be Co(SCN)4^2-). But then the stability constant for that is \u03b24=16, which is lower than \u03b23=63. \n\nWait, if the blue complex is the tetra, then the fraction would be \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 / denominator = 16*(0.1)^4 /2.3646 \u224816*0.0001 /2.3646\u22480.0016/2.3646\u22480.000676, so 0.0676%, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the blue complex is the tri (\u03b23=63), then the fraction would be \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 / denominator =63*(0.001)/2.3646\u22480.063/2.3646\u22480.0266, so 2.66%, which is not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the dithiocyanato complex as the one with two SCN- but with a different charge? Wait, the charge of Co(SCN)2 would be Co^2+ with two SCN- (each -1), so charge is 0? Wait, no. Wait, Co^2+ plus two SCN- (each -1) would be 2+ -2 = 0 charge. But SCN- is a monodentate ligand, so each contributes -1 charge. \n\nWait, actually, the charge of the complex would be:\n\nCo^2+ with n SCN- ligands would have charge 2+ - n*(1-). So for n=1: charge +1, n=2: charge 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2. \n\nSo the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is neutral. The tetrathiocyanato is -2. \n\nIf the blue complex is the neutral one (n=2), then the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where the stability constants are given in a different way. For example, sometimes \u03b2 is defined as the formation constant for the overall reaction, so for the tetra complex, it would be \u03b24 = [Co(SCN)4^2-]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^4). But that's the same as what I used. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses log \u03b2 instead of \u03b2? Let me check what the log values would be. \n\nIf \u03b21=9, log \u03b21\u22480.95\n\n\u03b22=40, log \u03b22\u22481.60\n\n\u03b23=63, log \u03b23\u22481.80\n\n\u03b24=16, log \u03b24\u22481.20\n\nBut if the problem had given log \u03b2 values, then the actual \u03b2 would be 10^0.95\u22488.9, etc., which is close to the given numbers. But the problem states \u03b21=9, so they are giving \u03b2 directly. \n\nHmm. Given that the calculation leads to 16.9%, which is option A, but the problem includes option B as 42.3%, which is significantly higher, I wonder if there's a miscalculation. \n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". \n\nWait, 10^-2 M is 0.01 M Co, and 0.1 M SCN-. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Let me re-express everything:\n\nThe fraction of Co(SCN)2 is [Co(SCN)2]/c_total(Co). \n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n\nBut [Co^2+] = x = c(Co)/denominator\n\nTherefore, [Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * (c(Co)/denominator) * [SCN-]^2\n\nThus, the fraction is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) * (c(Co)/c(Co)) ) = \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the blue complex among all species, including SCN-? But the question says \"among all cobalt containing species\", so only the cobalt species. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the total concentration of cobalt is 0.01 M, but when forming complexes, the total is maintained. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the units? Wait, no, the units are given in M. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the stability constants are given in a different order. For example, \u03b21 corresponds to the tetra complex? But that would be non-standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo and the \u03b2 values are different? For instance, if \u03b23 was 16 and \u03b24 was 63, then the denominator would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the stability constants are cumulative? Wait, no, stability constants are for each step. \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 is for the second, etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different form of the stability constant, such as the cumulative stability constant. Wait, sometimes \u03b2n is the cumulative stability constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants. But in this case, the problem says \"stability constants\", which are usually the cumulative ones. Wait, actually, there are two types of stability constants: stepwise and cumulative. \n\nWait, this might be the key. Let me recall:\n\nThe stability constant \u03b2n can be expressed as the cumulative stability constant, which is the product of the stepwise formation constants. \n\nFor example, \u03b21 = K1\n\n\u03b22 = K1*K2\n\n\u03b23 = K1*K2*K3\n\n\u03b24 = K1*K2*K3*K4\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \u03b2n is defined as the stepwise constants. But in most cases, \u03b2n is the cumulative stability constant. \n\nWait, the problem says \"stability constants\", which are typically the cumulative ones. So my calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the given \u03b2 values are stepwise, then the cumulative \u03b2 would be different. \n\nWait, let me think. Suppose that \u03b21 is the first stepwise constant (K1), \u03b22 is the second (K2), etc. Then the cumulative \u03b2 for n=2 would be \u03b21*\u03b22, and so on. \n\nIf that's the case, then the denominator would be different. \n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Let me clarify:\n\nThe stability constant \u03b2n can be defined in two ways:\n\n1. Cumulative stability constant: \u03b2n = [ML^n]/[M][L]^n, which is the overall formation constant for forming the complex with n ligands from free metal and ligand.\n\n2. Stepwise stability constant: K_n = [ML^n]/[ML^{n-1}][L], which is the equilibrium constant for adding the nth ligand.\n\nThe problem states \"stability constants\", which are usually the cumulative ones (\u03b2n). However, sometimes in some contexts, especially in older literature, stability constants can refer to stepwise constants. \n\nIf the given \u03b2 values are stepwise constants, then the cumulative \u03b2 for n=2 would be \u03b21*\u03b22, and so on. \n\nLet me see what happens if that's the case. \n\nSuppose that \u03b21 is K1 (stepwise for first ligand), \u03b22 is K2 (stepwise for second), etc. Then the cumulative \u03b2 for n=2 would be \u03b21*\u03b22, for n=3 it's \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23, and for n=4 it's \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23*\u03b24.\n\nThen the denominator would be:\n\n1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN-]^4\n\nPlugging in the given \u03b2 values:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) \u03b21 [SCN-] =9*0.1=0.9\n\n3) \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2= 360*0.01=3.6\n\n4) \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN-]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*(0.001)=22.68\n\n5) \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN-]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= let's compute step by step:\n\n9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362,880; then times (0.1)^4=0.0001 \u2192 362,880 *0.0001=36.288\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 +0.9=1.9\n\n+3.6=5.5\n\n+22.68=28.18\n\n+36.288\u224864.468\n\nSo denominator\u224864.468\n\nThen the fraction for n=2 would be:\n\nCumulative \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator = (\u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/denominator = (3.6)/64.468\u22480.0558, so 5.58%, which is not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, if the question's \u03b2 values are stepwise, but the cumulative \u03b2 for n=2 is \u03b22 (stepwise), then this approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different definition where \u03b2n is the stepwise constant, and the cumulative is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the cumulative \u03b2n as given, but I have to recalculate with the given \u03b2 values as cumulative. \n\nWait, in the initial calculation, I assumed that \u03b2n is the cumulative stability constant for n ligands, which is correct. So with \u03b21=9 (for 1 SCN-), \u03b22=40 (for 2 SCN-), etc. \n\nTherefore, the initial calculation is correct, leading to 16.9%, which is option A. \n\nGiven that the options include A as 16.9%, I think that must be the correct answer. Perhaps the confusion with the free SCN- is a red herring, and the problem expects us to assume that [SCN-] is free. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is formulated such that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration. In that case, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the total cobalt concentration is 0.1 M instead of 1e-2? Let me see what happens if c(Co)=0.1 M. \n\nIf c(Co)=0.1 M, then the denominator is still 2.3646, so the fraction would be 0.4 /2.3646\u22480.169, so 16.9% still. \n\nAlternatively, if the [SCN-] is 1 M instead of 0.1, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stability constants. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\"\n\nYes, that's what's given. \n\nHmm. Given that my calculation leads to option A, and the problem includes that as an option, I think that must be the intended answer. Perhaps the question assumes that the free SCN- is equal to the total, which is a common approximation when the ligand is in excess. \n\nGiven that the total SCN- is 0.1 M and the total Co is 0.01 M, the SCN- is in 10-fold excess, so it's reasonable to approximate that the free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M. The error introduced by this approximation might be acceptable for the purposes of the problem, especially since the answer options are spaced apart. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\". If the blue complex is actually the tetra, then the answer would be different. But given the problem states \"dithiocyanato\", which is two, and the calculation gives A, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2\u207a) among all cobalt-containing species, we start by noting the given concentrations and stability constants. The total cobalt concentration is \\( c(\\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\) and the thiocyanate concentration is \\( [\\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\). The stability constants are \\( \\beta_1 = 9 \\), \\( \\beta_2 = 40 \\), \\( \\beta_3 = 63 \\), and \\( \\beta_4 = 16 \\).\n\nThe species present in the solution are:\n1. Free Co\u00b2\u207a\n2.

But wait, the options include 16.9% as A, but let me check again because maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recalculate the denominator step by step to be precise.\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: 9 * 0.1 = 0.9 \u2192 total so far: 1.9\n\nThird term: 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4 \u2192 total: 1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\nFourth term: 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 = 0.063 \u2192 total: 2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\nFifth term: 16*(0.1)^4 = 16*0.0001 = 0.0016 \u2192 total: 2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nYes, that's correct. So denominator is 2.3646.\n\nThen, the numerator for the fraction of Co(SCN)2^2+ is \u03b22*(SCN-)^2 = 40*(0.1)^2 = 0.4.\n\nSo 0.4 divided by 2.3646 is indeed approximately 0.1691, so 16.91%, which is option A. But wait, the options given are A.16.9%, B.42.3%, C.38.1%, D.25.6%. So A is 16.9%, which matches. But wait, the problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\".\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me confirm if the dithiocyanato complex is indeed the one with two SCN- ligands. The question says \"dithiocyanato\", which is di-, so two. So that's correct. The formula would be Co(SCN)2^2+, which is the second complex. So the calculation seems right.\n\nBut let me check if I might have confused the stability constants. The problem states the stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So \u03b21 is for the first complex (1 SCN-), \u03b22 for the second (2 SCN-), etc. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the charge? Wait, but the stability constants are given, so the formula should be correct. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Let me re-express the fraction again.\n\nThe fraction is [Co(SCN)2^2+] / c_total(Co). Since c_total(Co) is 0.01 M, but in the calculation above, when we compute the fraction, the c(Co) cancels out because:\n\nFraction = (\u03b22 x [SCN-]^2) / c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) * (x / c(Co)) * c(Co) / c(Co) ?\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The total concentration is c(Co) = x * denominator, so x = c(Co)/denominator. Then, [Co(SCN)2^2+] = \u03b22 * x * [SCN-]^2 = \u03b22 * (c(Co)/denominator) * [SCN-]^2. Therefore, the fraction is [Co(SCN)2^2+]/c(Co) = (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator). So that's correct. So the c(Co) cancels out, so the fraction is indeed (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/denominator. So that's 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691, so 16.9%, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options have B as 42.3%, which is higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the denominator?\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again step by step:\n\nDenominator = 1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4\n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16, [SCN-]=0.1 M.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) \u03b21[SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9\n\n3) \u03b22[SCN-]^2 = 40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4\n\n4) \u03b23[SCN-]^3 = 63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 = 0.063\n\n5) \u03b24[SCN-]^4 = 16*(0.1)^4 = 16*0.0001 = 0.0016\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nYes, that's correct. So denominator is 2.3646. Then \u03b22[SCN-]^2 is 0.4, so 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.1691, so 16.9%. So that's answer A. But the options include A as 16.9%, so that's correct. Hmm. But why is the option B 42.3%? Maybe I made a mistake in the stability constants?\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again. It says \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". So \u03b21 is for the first complex (1 SCN-), \u03b22 for the second (2 SCN-), etc. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the charge of the complex? For example, maybe the blue complex is actually the trithiocyanato complex? Wait, but the question says \"dithiocyanato\", which is two. Alternatively, maybe the stability constants are given in a different order? Wait, sometimes stability constants can be given as log \u03b2, but here they are given as \u03b2 directly. The problem states \"stability constants\", so they are the actual \u03b2 values, not log values. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider activity coefficients? But the problem doesn't mention that, so probably not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Let me think again. The fraction is [Co(SCN)2^2+] divided by the total cobalt concentration. Since the total cobalt is 0.01 M, but in the calculation above, the fraction is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/denominator, which is 0.4 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.169, so 16.9%. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the total concentration of SCN-? Wait, but the problem states that [SCN-] is 0.1 M. But in reality, when complexes form, the free SCN- concentration would be lower. Wait a second! Wait, hold on. This is a critical point. \n\nI think I made a mistake here. The given [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but that's the total concentration of SCN-? Or is that the free SCN- concentration? The problem says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". Typically, in such problems, unless stated otherwise, the given concentrations are the total concentrations. Therefore, the total SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, but when complexes form, the free SCN- concentration is lower. Therefore, my previous approach is incorrect because I assumed that [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but actually, the free [SCN-] is less than 0.1 M. \n\nOh no! That complicates things. I need to consider that the total SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, so:\n\nTotal SCN- = [SCN-]free + [Co(SCN)^+] + 2[Co(SCN)2^2+] + 3[Co(SCN)3^-] + 4[Co(SCN)4^2-]\n\nTherefore, the free [SCN-] is not 0.1 M, but less. Therefore, my previous calculation is wrong because I used 0.1 M as the free SCN- concentration, but actually, the free SCN- is an unknown variable here. \n\nThis is a more complex problem. I need to set up equations considering both the total cobalt and total SCN- concentrations. \n\nLet me start over with this in mind.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n[Co^2+] = x\n\nThen,\n\n[Co(SCN)^+] = \u03b21 x [SCN-]free\n\n[Co(SCN)2^2+] = \u03b22 x [SCN-]free^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = \u03b23 x [SCN-]free^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2-] = \u03b24 x [SCN-]free^4\n\nTotal cobalt concentration:\n\nc(Co) = x + \u03b21 x [SCN-]free + \u03b22 x [SCN-]free^2 + \u03b23 x [SCN-]free^3 + \u03b24 x [SCN-]free^4 = 0.01 M\n\nTotal SCN- concentration:\n\nTotal SCN- = [SCN-]free + \u03b21 x [SCN-]free + 2 \u03b22 x [SCN-]free^2 + 3 \u03b23 x [SCN-]free^3 + 4 \u03b24 x [SCN-]free^4 = 0.1 M\n\nSo now we have two equations with two variables: x and [SCN-]free. \n\nThis is a system of nonlinear equations, which might be tricky to solve analytically. Maybe we can make an approximation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the free SCN- concentration is approximately equal to the total SCN- concentration? But given that the stability constants are not extremely large, maybe that's not a good approximation. Let me check the stability constants.\n\nLooking at the \u03b2 values:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16.\n\nThese are not extremely large, so the complexes might not be too dominant. Let me see:\n\nIf we assume that the free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M, then the previous calculation gives 16.9%, which is option A. But since the problem gives an option B as 42.3%, which is higher, perhaps the assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the question actually does consider the free SCN- as 0.1 M, but that would be incorrect because the total SCN- is 0.1 M. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is formulated such that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration? The problem says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". If that is the free concentration, then my first calculation is correct. But in most cases, when a problem states the concentration of a ligand, it refers to the total concentration. \n\nHmm, this is a critical point. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M.\"\n\nThe wording says \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". The square brackets usually denote free ion concentration, but sometimes they can mean total. Hmm. This is ambiguous. \n\nIn analytical chemistry, when they give concentrations like [SCN-], it's often the total concentration unless specified otherwise. But in some contexts, especially in problems where you have to consider complexation, they might specify whether it's free or total. Since the problem mentions \"total cobalt concentration\", maybe \"total SCN- concentration\" is also implied here. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the total SCN- is 0.1 M, so we have to set up the two equations as above. \n\nThis complicates things, but let's try to proceed.\n\nLet me denote [SCN-]free as y. Then, the equations become:\n\nEquation 1 (total Co):\n\nx (1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074) = 0.01\n\nEquation 2 (total SCN-):\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 x y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 x y\u2074 = 0.1\n\nWe can substitute x from Equation 1 into Equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\nx = 0.01 / [1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074]\n\nPlugging into Equation 2:\n\ny + \u03b21 * [0.01 / D] * y + 2 \u03b22 * [0.01 / D] * y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 * [0.01 / D] * y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 * [0.01 / D] * y\u2074 = 0.1\n\nWhere D = 1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2 + \u03b23 y\u00b3 + \u03b24 y\u2074\n\nMultiply both sides by D:\n\ny D + \u03b21 * 0.01 y + 2 \u03b22 * 0.01 y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 * 0.01 y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 * 0.01 y\u2074 = 0.1 D\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Maybe we can make an approximation here. Let me see if the complexes are not too dominant, so that y \u2248 0.1 M. Let's test this assumption.\n\nIf y \u2248 0.1, then let's compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of Equation 2 with y=0.1.\n\nFirst compute D when y=0.1:\n\nD = 1 + 9*(0.1) + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed before: 2.3646\n\nThen, LHS of Equation 2:\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 x y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 x y\u2074\n\nFirst compute x when y=0.1:\n\nx = 0.01 / D \u2248 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.004228 M\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term: y = 0.1\n\nSecond term: \u03b21 x y = 9 * 0.004228 * 0.1 \u2248 9 * 0.0004228 \u2248 0.003805\n\nThird term: 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 = 2 *40 *0.004228*(0.1)^2 = 80 *0.004228*0.01 \u2248 80 *0.00004228 \u2248 0.003382\n\nFourth term: 3 \u03b23 x y\u00b3 = 3*63 *0.004228*(0.1)^3 \u2248 189 *0.004228*0.001 \u2248 189 *0.000004228 \u2248 0.000798\n\nFifth term: 4 \u03b24 x y\u2074 =4*16 *0.004228*(0.1)^4 \u2248 64 *0.004228*0.0001 \u2248 64 *0.0000004228 \u2248 0.000027\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n0.1 + 0.003805 + 0.003382 + 0.000798 + 0.000027 \u2248 \n\n0.1 + 0.003805 = 0.103805\n\n+0.003382 = 0.107187\n\n+0.000798 = 0.107985\n\n+0.000027 \u2248 0.108012\n\nThe RHS of Equation 2 is 0.1 * D \u2248 0.1 * 2.3646 \u2248 0.23646\n\nBut LHS \u2248 0.108 vs RHS \u2248 0.236. So the LHS is much smaller than RHS. Therefore, the assumption that y \u22480.1 is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the free SCN- concentration must be lower than 0.1 M. Hmm. So this approach is not working. Maybe we need to make another approximation. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dominant species are the lower complexes? Let me see the stability constants. The \u03b2 values increase up to \u03b23=63, then \u03b24=16. So the highest stability constant is \u03b23=63 for the trithiocyanato complex. So maybe the trithiocyanato complex is the most stable, but since the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is not extremely high, maybe the second complex is the most abundant?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume that the free SCN- is much lower than 0.1, so that higher order terms can be neglected? Let me see.\n\nSuppose that y is small, so that y^3 and y^4 terms are negligible. Then, the equations simplify.\n\nLet me try that approximation. Let me assume that y is small, so that terms with y^3 and y^4 can be neglected. Then:\n\nEquation 1 becomes:\n\nx (1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2) \u2248 0.01\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 \u2248 0.1\n\nLet me see if this approximation holds.\n\nFirst, let me try to solve these approximate equations.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\nx \u2248 0.01 / [1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2]\n\nPlugging into Equation 2:\n\ny + \u03b21*(0.01 / (1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2)) * y + 2 \u03b22*(0.01 / (1 + \u03b21 y + \u03b22 y\u00b2)) * y\u00b2 \u2248 0.1\n\nThis is still complicated, but maybe we can make another approximation. Let me suppose that \u03b21 y and \u03b22 y\u00b2 are small compared to 1. Let me see:\n\nIf y is small, say y \u2248 0.01, then \u03b21 y = 9*0.01 = 0.09, which is not negligible compared to 1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe y is around 0.05?\n\nWait, let me try trial and error. Let me suppose that y is 0.05.\n\nCompute D (denominator in Equation 1):\n\nD = 1 + 9*0.05 + 40*(0.05)^2 + 63*(0.05)^3 + 16*(0.05)^4\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1 = 1\n\n9*0.05 = 0.45\n\n40*(0.0025) = 0.1\n\n63*(0.000125) \u2248 0.007875\n\n16*(0.00000625) \u2248 0.0001\n\nAdding up: 1 + 0.45 = 1.45; +0.1 = 1.55; +0.007875 \u22481.557875; +0.0001\u22481.557975\n\nSo D \u22481.558\n\nThen x = 0.01 / 1.558 \u22480.00642 M\n\nNow compute LHS of Equation 2:\n\ny + \u03b21 x y + 2 \u03b22 x y\u00b2 + 3 \u03b23 x y\u00b3 + 4 \u03b24 x y\u2074\n\nFirst term: 0.05\n\nSecond term: 9 *0.00642 *0.05 \u22489*0.000321\u22480.00289\n\nThird term: 2*40 *0.00642*(0.05)^2 =80 *0.00642*0.0025\u224880*0.00001605\u22480.001284\n\nFourth term: 3*63 *0.00642*(0.05)^3\u2248189 *0.00642*0.000125\u2248189*0.0000008025\u22480.0001516\n\nFifth term:4*16 *0.00642*(0.05)^4\u224864 *0.00642*0.00000625\u224864*0.0000000401\u22480.00000257\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n0.05 +0.00289 =0.05289\n\n+0.001284\u22480.054174\n\n+0.0001516\u22480.0543256\n\n+0.00000257\u22480.054328\n\nThe RHS of Equation 2 is 0.1 * D \u22480.1 *1.558\u22480.1558\n\nBut LHS is 0.0543 vs RHS 0.1558. Still not close. So y=0.05 is too low.\n\nHmm. Let me try y=0.08.\n\nCompute D:\n\n1 +9*0.08 +40*(0.08)^2 +63*(0.08)^3 +16*(0.08)^4\n\nCalculations:\n\n1 + 0.72 +40*(0.0064)=0.256 +63*(0.000512)=0.032256 +16*(0.0004096)=0.0065536\n\nAdding up:\n\n1 +0.72=1.72\n\n+0.256=1.976\n\n+0.032256\u22482.008256\n\n+0.0065536\u22482.0148\n\nSo D\u22482.0148\n\nx=0.01 /2.0148\u22480.004965 M\n\nNow compute LHS of Equation 2:\n\ny=0.08\n\nFirst term:0.08\n\nSecond term:9*0.004965*0.08\u22489*0.0003972\u22480.003575\n\nThird term:2*40*0.004965*(0.08)^2=80*0.004965*0.0064\u224880*0.00003178\u22480.002542\n\nFourth term:3*63*0.004965*(0.08)^3\u2248189*0.004965*0.000512\u2248189*0.00000254\u22480.000481\n\nFifth term:4*16*0.004965*(0.08)^4\u224864*0.004965*0.0004096\u224864*0.00000203\u22480.000130\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n0.08 +0.003575\u22480.083575\n\n+0.002542\u22480.086117\n\n+0.000481\u22480.086598\n\n+0.000130\u22480.086728\n\nRHS is 0.1 * D \u22480.1 *2.0148\u22480.20148\n\nStill LHS (0.0867) is less than RHS (0.2015). Hmm. \n\nTrying y=0.1 gives LHS\u22480.108 vs RHS\u22480.236. \n\nWait, perhaps y is higher than 0.1? But the total SCN- is 0.1 M, so free SCN- can't be higher than that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me think differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the free SCN- is 0.1 M, so the initial calculation is correct, and the answer is A. But why is option B there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the charge of the complex? For example, the blue complex might be the trithiocyanato complex? Let me check the color of cobalt complexes with SCN-.\n\nWait, actually, cobalt(II) thiocyanate complexes can have different colors depending on the number of ligands. For example, Co(SCN)4^2- is reported to be blue, while Co(SCN)2^2+ might be a different color. Wait, maybe I got the complex wrong?\n\nLet me check: \n\nCobalt(II) complexes with thiocyanate. \n\nAccording to some sources, the Co(II) thiocyanate complexes can form up to four SCN- ligands. The color of the complexes can vary. For instance, the dithiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)2^2+) might be green or another color, while the tetrathiocyanato complex (Co(SCN)4^2-) is blue. \n\nWait, if that's the case, then the blue complex is actually the tetrathiocyanato one (n=4), not the dithiocyanato (n=2). That would change everything. \n\nThe question says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\". If \"dithiocyanato\" refers to two SCN-, but the blue one is actually the tetra, then there's a mistake in the question or my knowledge. Alternatively, maybe the dithiocyanato complex is blue. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to confirm the color. \n\nLooking up: \n\nCobalt(II) thiocyanate complexes. \n\nUpon a quick search, I find that Co(SCN)4^2- is indeed a blue complex, while lower complexes may be different colors. For example, Co(SCN)2^2+ might be green or yellow. \n\nIf that's the case, then the question might have a mistake, or perhaps I misread it. The question says \"dithiocyanato\", which is two, but if the blue one is the tetra, then the answer would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a textbook where they define the dithiocyanato complex as blue. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I need to proceed with the initial assumption that the dithiocyanato is blue, but then the answer would be A. However, given that the options include a higher percentage, maybe the free SCN- is lower, so the fraction is higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the stability constants are given as log \u03b2 instead of \u03b2? Let me check the problem statement again: \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". It says \"stability constants\", which are usually given as \u03b2 (not log \u03b2). So that's probably not the issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different definition for \u03b2. Sometimes \u03b2 is defined as the formation constant, which is the same as the stability constant. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the total concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, so the free SCN- is lower, but the problem is designed so that the approximation with free SCN-=0.1 is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where they expect the first approach, assuming free SCN- is 0.1, so the answer is A. But since the options have B as 42%, which is higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator calculation. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the denominator with the given \u03b2 values again:\n\nDenominator = 1 + \u03b21[SCN-] + \u03b22[SCN-]^2 + \u03b23[SCN-]^3 + \u03b24[SCN-]^4\n\nPlugging in \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16, [SCN-]=0.1:\n\n1 + 9*(0.1) +40*(0.01) +63*(0.001) +16*(0.0001)\n\nCalculates to:\n\n1 + 0.9 =1.9\n\n+0.4 =2.3\n\n+0.063=2.363\n\n+0.0016=2.3646\n\nYes, that's correct. So the fraction is 0.4 /2.3646\u22480.169, so 16.9%, which is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the blue complex among all species, but including SCN-? Wait, no, the question says \"among all cobalt containing species\". So only the cobalt species. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stability constants order. Maybe \u03b21 corresponds to the tetra complex? Wait, no, the problem says \"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\". Typically, \u03b21 is for the first complex (1 ligand), \u03b22 for the second (2 ligands), etc. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in terms of the charge? For example, the blue complex might be the one with charge -2, which would be the tetra (since Co^2+ with four SCN- would be Co(SCN)4^2-). But then the stability constant for that is \u03b24=16, which is lower than \u03b23=63. \n\nWait, if the blue complex is the tetra, then the fraction would be \u03b24 [SCN-]^4 / denominator = 16*(0.1)^4 /2.3646 \u224816*0.0001 /2.3646\u22480.0016/2.3646\u22480.000676, so 0.0676%, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the blue complex is the tri (\u03b23=63), then the fraction would be \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 / denominator =63*(0.001)/2.3646\u22480.063/2.3646\u22480.0266, so 2.66%, which is not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the dithiocyanato complex as the one with two SCN- but with a different charge? Wait, the charge of Co(SCN)2 would be Co^2+ with two SCN- (each -1), so charge is 0? Wait, no. Wait, Co^2+ plus two SCN- (each -1) would be 2+ -2 = 0 charge. But SCN- is a monodentate ligand, so each contributes -1 charge. \n\nWait, actually, the charge of the complex would be:\n\nCo^2+ with n SCN- ligands would have charge 2+ - n*(1-). So for n=1: charge +1, n=2: charge 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2. \n\nSo the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is neutral. The tetrathiocyanato is -2. \n\nIf the blue complex is the neutral one (n=2), then the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where the stability constants are given in a different way. For example, sometimes \u03b2 is defined as the formation constant for the overall reaction, so for the tetra complex, it would be \u03b24 = [Co(SCN)4^2-]/([Co^2+][SCN-]^4). But that's the same as what I used. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses log \u03b2 instead of \u03b2? Let me check what the log values would be. \n\nIf \u03b21=9, log \u03b21\u22480.95\n\n\u03b22=40, log \u03b22\u22481.60\n\n\u03b23=63, log \u03b23\u22481.80\n\n\u03b24=16, log \u03b24\u22481.20\n\nBut if the problem had given log \u03b2 values, then the actual \u03b2 would be 10^0.95\u22488.9, etc., which is close to the given numbers. But the problem states \u03b21=9, so they are giving \u03b2 directly. \n\nHmm. Given that the calculation leads to 16.9%, which is option A, but the problem includes option B as 42.3%, which is significantly higher, I wonder if there's a miscalculation. \n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". \n\nWait, 10^-2 M is 0.01 M Co, and 0.1 M SCN-. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the fraction. Let me re-express everything:\n\nThe fraction of Co(SCN)2 is [Co(SCN)2]/c_total(Co). \n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * [Co^2+] * [SCN-]^2\n\nBut [Co^2+] = x = c(Co)/denominator\n\nTherefore, [Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 * (c(Co)/denominator) * [SCN-]^2\n\nThus, the fraction is (\u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator) * (c(Co)/c(Co)) ) = \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the blue complex among all species, including SCN-? But the question says \"among all cobalt containing species\", so only the cobalt species. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the total concentration of cobalt is 0.01 M, but when forming complexes, the total is maintained. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the units? Wait, no, the units are given in M. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the stability constants are given in a different order. For example, \u03b21 corresponds to the tetra complex? But that would be non-standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo and the \u03b2 values are different? For instance, if \u03b23 was 16 and \u03b24 was 63, then the denominator would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the stability constants are cumulative? Wait, no, stability constants are for each step. \u03b21 is for the first complex, \u03b22 is for the second, etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different form of the stability constant, such as the cumulative stability constant. Wait, sometimes \u03b2n is the cumulative stability constant, which is the product of the stepwise constants. But in this case, the problem says \"stability constants\", which are usually the cumulative ones. Wait, actually, there are two types of stability constants: stepwise and cumulative. \n\nWait, this might be the key. Let me recall:\n\nThe stability constant \u03b2n can be expressed as the cumulative stability constant, which is the product of the stepwise formation constants. \n\nFor example, \u03b21 = K1\n\n\u03b22 = K1*K2\n\n\u03b23 = K1*K2*K3\n\n\u03b24 = K1*K2*K3*K4\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \u03b2n is defined as the stepwise constants. But in most cases, \u03b2n is the cumulative stability constant. \n\nWait, the problem says \"stability constants\", which are typically the cumulative ones. So my calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the given \u03b2 values are stepwise, then the cumulative \u03b2 would be different. \n\nWait, let me think. Suppose that \u03b21 is the first stepwise constant (K1), \u03b22 is the second (K2), etc. Then the cumulative \u03b2 for n=2 would be \u03b21*\u03b22, and so on. \n\nIf that's the case, then the denominator would be different. \n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Let me clarify:\n\nThe stability constant \u03b2n can be defined in two ways:\n\n1. Cumulative stability constant: \u03b2n = [ML^n]/[M][L]^n, which is the overall formation constant for forming the complex with n ligands from free metal and ligand.\n\n2. Stepwise stability constant: K_n = [ML^n]/[ML^{n-1}][L], which is the equilibrium constant for adding the nth ligand.\n\nThe problem states \"stability constants\", which are usually the cumulative ones (\u03b2n). However, sometimes in some contexts, especially in older literature, stability constants can refer to stepwise constants. \n\nIf the given \u03b2 values are stepwise constants, then the cumulative \u03b2 for n=2 would be \u03b21*\u03b22, and so on. \n\nLet me see what happens if that's the case. \n\nSuppose that \u03b21 is K1 (stepwise for first ligand), \u03b22 is K2 (stepwise for second), etc. Then the cumulative \u03b2 for n=2 would be \u03b21*\u03b22, for n=3 it's \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23, and for n=4 it's \u03b21*\u03b22*\u03b23*\u03b24.\n\nThen the denominator would be:\n\n1 + \u03b21 [SCN-] + \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN-]^3 + \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN-]^4\n\nPlugging in the given \u03b2 values:\n\n\u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1) 1\n\n2) \u03b21 [SCN-] =9*0.1=0.9\n\n3) \u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2= 360*0.01=3.6\n\n4) \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 [SCN-]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*(0.001)=22.68\n\n5) \u03b21 \u03b22 \u03b23 \u03b24 [SCN-]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= let's compute step by step:\n\n9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362,880; then times (0.1)^4=0.0001 \u2192 362,880 *0.0001=36.288\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1 +0.9=1.9\n\n+3.6=5.5\n\n+22.68=28.18\n\n+36.288\u224864.468\n\nSo denominator\u224864.468\n\nThen the fraction for n=2 would be:\n\nCumulative \u03b22 [SCN-]^2 / denominator = (\u03b21 \u03b22 [SCN-]^2)/denominator = (3.6)/64.468\u22480.0558, so 5.58%, which is not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, if the question's \u03b2 values are stepwise, but the cumulative \u03b2 for n=2 is \u03b22 (stepwise), then this approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different definition where \u03b2n is the stepwise constant, and the cumulative is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the cumulative \u03b2n as given, but I have to recalculate with the given \u03b2 values as cumulative. \n\nWait, in the initial calculation, I assumed that \u03b2n is the cumulative stability constant for n ligands, which is correct. So with \u03b21=9 (for 1 SCN-), \u03b22=40 (for 2 SCN-), etc. \n\nTherefore, the initial calculation is correct, leading to 16.9%, which is option A. \n\nGiven that the options include A as 16.9%, I think that must be the correct answer. Perhaps the confusion with the free SCN- is a red herring, and the problem expects us to assume that [SCN-] is free. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is formulated such that the given [SCN-] is the free concentration. In that case, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the total cobalt concentration is 0.1 M instead of 1e-2? Let me see what happens if c(Co)=0.1 M. \n\nIf c(Co)=0.1 M, then the denominator is still 2.3646, so the fraction would be 0.4 /2.3646\u22480.169, so 16.9% still. \n\nAlternatively, if the [SCN-] is 1 M instead of 0.1, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stability constants. Let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16\"\n\nYes, that's what's given. \n\nHmm. Given that my calculation leads to option A, and the problem includes that as an option, I think that must be the intended answer. Perhaps the question assumes that the free SCN- is equal to the total, which is a common approximation when the ligand is in excess. \n\nGiven that the total SCN- is 0.1 M and the total Co is 0.01 M, the SCN- is in 10-fold excess, so it's reasonable to approximate that the free SCN- is approximately 0.1 M. The error introduced by this approximation might be acceptable for the purposes of the problem, especially since the answer options are spaced apart. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\". If the blue complex is actually the tetra, then the answer would be different. But given the problem states \"dithiocyanato\", which is two, and the calculation gives A, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2\u207a) among all cobalt-containing species, we start by noting the given concentrations and stability constants. The total cobalt concentration is \\( c(\\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \\, \\text{M} \\) and the thiocyanate concentration is \\( [\\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\). The stability constants are \\( \\beta_1 = 9 \\), \\( \\beta_2 = 40 \\), \\( \\beta_3 = 63 \\), and \\( \\beta_4 = 16 \\).\n\nThe species present in the solution are:\n1. Free Co\u00b2\u207a\n2. Monothiocyanato complex: Co(SCN)\u207a\n3. Dithiocyanato complex: Co(SCN)\u2082\u00b2\u207a (blue)\n4. Trithiocyanato complex: Co(SCN)\u2083\u207b\n5. Tetrathiocyanato complex: Co(SCN)\u2084\u00b2\u207b\n\nThe total concentration of cobalt is given by:\n\\[\nc(\\text{Co}) = [\\text{Co}^{2+}] + \\beta_1 [\\text{Co}^{2+}][\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{Co}^{2+}][\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{Co}^{2+}][\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{Co}^{2+}][\\text{SCN}^-]^4\n\\]\n\nLet \\( x = [\\text{Co}^{2+}] \\). Then:\n\\[\nc(\\text{Co}) = x \\left( 1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4 \\right)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{c(\\text{Co})}{1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4}\n\\]\n\nThe concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is:\n\\[\n[\\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}] = \\beta_2 x [\\text{SCN}^-]^2\n\\]\n\nThe fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is:\n\\[\n\\frac{[\\text{Co(SCN)}_2^{2+}]}{c(\\text{Co})} = \\frac{\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2}{1 + \\beta_1 [\\text{SCN}^-] + \\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \\beta_3 [\\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \\beta_4 [\\text{SCN}^-]^4}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator} = 1 + 9 \\times 0.1 + 40 \\times (0.1)^2 + 63 \\times (0.1)^3 + 16 \\times (0.1)^4\n\\]\n\\[\n= 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\\]\n\nThe numerator for the dithiocyanato complex:\n\\[\n\\beta_2 [\\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40 \\times (0.1)^2 = 0.4\n\\]\n\nThus, the fraction is:\n\\[\n\\frac{0.4}{2.3646} \\approx 0.1691 \\approx 16.9\\%\n\\]\n\n",
