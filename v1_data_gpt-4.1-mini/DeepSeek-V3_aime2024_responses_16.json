        "question": "Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.",
        "response": "Alright, I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a specific surface area and volume. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any such box, and then determine \\( r^2 \\) in the form \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are coprime integers. Finally, I need to find \\( p + q \\).\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)**: This is the set of all rectangular boxes with:\n   - Surface area = 54\n   - Volume = 23\n\n2. **Smallest sphere**: For each box in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. The radius of this sphere is \\( r \\).\n\n3. **Find \\( r^2 \\)**: Express \\( r^2 \\) as a fraction \\( \\frac{p}{q} \\) in lowest terms and compute \\( p + q \\).\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the properties of the rectangular boxes in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\).\n\n### Step 1: Define the Dimensions of the Box\n\nLet's denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\). So, the box has length \\( a \\), width \\( b \\), and height \\( c \\).\n\nGiven:\n- Surface area \\( S = 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \\)\n- Volume \\( V = abc = 23 \\)\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \\]\n\\[ ab + bc + ca = 27 \\]\n\\[ abc = 23 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the Relationship Between \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\)\n\nWe have two equations:\n1. \\( ab + bc + ca = 27 \\)\n2. \\( abc = 23 \\)\n\nI need to find a relationship or express one variable in terms of the others. Maybe I can express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nFrom the volume equation:\n\\[ c = \\frac{23}{ab} \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( c \\) into the surface area equation:\n\\[ ab + b\\left(\\frac{23}{ab}\\right) + a\\left(\\frac{23}{ab}\\right) = 27 \\]\n\\[ ab + \\frac{23}{a} + \\frac{23}{b} = 27 \\]\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Symmetry or Specific Cases\n\nPerhaps the box is a cube. Let's check if a cube satisfies the given conditions.\n\nIf the box is a cube, then \\( a = b = c \\).\n\nGiven:\n\\[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54 \\]\n\\[ 2(3a^2) = 54 \\]\n\\[ 6a^2 = 54 \\]\n\\[ a^2 = 9 \\]\n\\[ a = 3 \\]\n\nVolume:\n\\[ abc = a^3 = 27 \\]\n\nBut the volume is given as 23, not 27. So, the box is not a cube.\n\nAlright, so the box is not a cube. Let's think differently.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Diagonal of the Box\n\nThe smallest sphere that can contain the box will have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \\( d \\) of a rectangular box with dimensions \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) is given by:\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the radius \\( r \\) of the sphere is half the diagonal:\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2} \\]\n\nSo, \\( r^2 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} \\)\n\nNow, I need to find \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) given that \\( ab + bc + ca = 27 \\) and \\( abc = 23 \\).\n\n### Step 5: Express \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) in Terms of \\( ab + bc + ca \\) and \\( abc \\)\n\nI recall that:\n\\[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) \\]\n\nBut I don't know \\( a + b + c \\). Maybe I can find it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the identity:\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (ab + bc + ca)^2 - 2abc(a + b + c) \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's think carefully.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake here. Let's recall the correct identity.\n\nThe correct identity is:\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) \\]\n\nBut I still need \\( a + b + c \\). Maybe I can find \\( a + b + c \\) using the given values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are roots of a cubic equation.\n\n### Step 6: Formulate a Cubic Equation\n\nGiven \\( ab + bc + ca = 27 \\) and \\( abc = 23 \\), \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are roots of the cubic equation:\n\\[ x^3 - (a + b + c)x^2 + (ab + bc + ca)x - abc = 0 \\]\n\\[ x^3 - (a + b + c)x^2 + 27x - 23 = 0 \\]\n\nBut without knowing \\( a + b + c \\), this doesn't directly help. Maybe I can find \\( a + b + c \\) using the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) in terms of \\( ab + bc + ca \\) and \\( abc \\).\n\nWait, I recall that:\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) \\]\n\nBut I still need \\( a + b + c \\). Maybe I can find \\( a + b + c \\) using the given values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are integers and try to find them.\n\nGiven \\( abc = 23 \\), and 23 is a prime number, so the possible integer dimensions are permutations of \\( (1, 1, 23) \\).\n\nLet's check if \\( (1, 1, 23) \\) satisfies the surface area condition.\n\nSurface area:\n\\[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 2(1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 23 + 1 \\cdot 23) = 2(1 + 23 + 23) = 2(47) = 94 \\]\n\nBut the surface area is given as 54, so \\( (1, 1, 23) \\) is not a valid box.\n\nNext, perhaps \\( (1, 23, 1) \\) or \\( (23, 1, 1) \\), but they are the same as \\( (1, 1, 23) \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dimensions are not integers. Let's think differently.\n\n### Step 7: Use Symmetric Functions\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\\[ S_1 = a + b + c \\]\n\\[ S_2 = ab + bc + ca = 27 \\]\n\\[ S_3 = abc = 23 \\]\n\nWe need to find \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\), which is:\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S_1^2 - 2S_2 \\]\n\nBut we don't know \\( S_1 \\). Maybe we can find \\( S_1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express \\( S_1 \\) in terms of \\( S_2 \\) and \\( S_3 \\).\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the fact that \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are roots of the cubic equation:\n\\[ x^3 - S_1 x^2 + S_2 x - S_3 = 0 \\]\n\nBut without additional information, this seems stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume that the box is \"close\" to a cube and estimate \\( S_1 \\).\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the AM-GM inequality.\n\n### Step 8: Apply the AM-GM Inequality\n\nThe AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers:\n\\[ \\frac{a + b + c}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{abc} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{S_1}{3} \\geq \\sqrt[3]{23} \\]\n\\[ S_1 \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{23} \\]\n\nBut this gives a lower bound, not the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express \\( S_1 \\) in terms of \\( S_2 \\) and \\( S_3 \\).\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the identity:\n\\[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \\]\n\\[ S_1^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2S_2 \\]\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S_1^2 - 2S_2 \\]\n\nBut we still need \\( S_1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find \\( S_1 \\) by considering the cubic equation.\n\nGiven the cubic equation:\n\\[ x^3 - S_1 x^2 + S_2 x - S_3 = 0 \\]\n\nBut without knowing the roots, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps we can assume that the box is \"close\" to a cube and estimate \\( S_1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the box is not a cube and try to find \\( S_1 \\) numerically.\n\nBut this seems too complicated for a problem that likely has an exact solution.\n\n### Step 9: Re-examining the Problem\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let's recall that the smallest sphere containing the box has a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box.\n\nSo, the radius \\( r \\) is:\n\\[ r = \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{2} \\]\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( ab + bc + ca = 27 \\) and \\( abc = 23 \\), I need to find \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\).\n\nWait, perhaps I can express \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) in terms of \\( ab + bc + ca \\) and \\( abc \\).\n\nWait, I recall that:\n\\[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \\]\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) \\]\n\nBut I still need \\( a + b + c \\). Maybe I can find \\( a + b + c \\) using the given values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are roots of the cubic equation:\n\\[ x^3 - (a + b + c)x^2 + (ab + bc + ca)x - abc = 0 \\]\n\\[ x^3 - S_1 x^2 + 27x - 23 = 0 \\]\n\nBut without knowing \\( S_1 \\), this seems stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the box is not a cube and try to find \\( S_1 \\) by assuming two dimensions are equal.\n\nLet's assume \\( a = b \\). Then, the equations become:\n\\[ 2a^2 + 2ac = 27 \\]\n\\[ a^2 c = 23 \\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[ c = \\frac{23}{a^2} \\]\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\\[ 2a^2 + 2a \\left( \\frac{23}{a^2} \\right) = 27 \\]\n\\[ 2a^2 + \\frac{46}{a} = 27 \\]\nMultiply both sides by \\( a \\):\n\\[ 2a^3 + 46 = 27a \\]\n\\[ 2a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve the cubic equation \\( 2a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0 \\).\n\nLet's try rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 46 divided by factors of 2, so \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm23, \\pm46, \\pm\\frac{1}{2}, \\pm\\frac{23}{2} \\).\n\nTry \\( a = 2 \\):\n\\[ 2(8) - 27(2) + 46 = 16 - 54 + 46 = 8 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nTry \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\\[ 2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) - 27\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 46 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{27}{2} + 46 = \\frac{1}{4} - 13.5 + 46 = 32.75 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nTry \\( a = -\\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\\[ 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{8}\\right) - 27\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 46 = -\\frac{1}{4} + 13.5 + 46 = 59.25 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nTry \\( a = 1 \\):\n\\[ 2(1) - 27(1) + 46 = 2 - 27 + 46 = 21 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nTry \\( a = -1 \\):\n\\[ 2(-1) - 27(-1) + 46 = -2 + 27 + 46 = 71 \\neq 0 \\]\n\nTry \\( a = \\frac{23}{2} \\):\n\\[ 2\\left(\\frac{12167}{8}\\right) - 27\\left(\\frac{23}{2}\\right) + 46 = \\frac{12167}{4} - \\frac{621}{2} + 46 \\]\nThis seems too large and not zero.\n\nTry \\( a = -\\frac{23}{2} \\):\nSimilarly, this will be negative and not zero.\n\nHmm, perhaps there are no rational roots. Maybe I need to use numerical methods or consider that my assumption \\( a = b \\) is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the box is not a cube and try to find \\( S_1 \\) by assuming two dimensions are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assume \\( b = c \\). Then, the equations become:\n\\[ 2ab + b^2 = 27 \\]\n\\[ ab^2 = 23 \\]\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\\[ a = \\frac{23}{b^2} \\]\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\\[ 2\\left(\\frac{23}{b^2}\\right)b + b^2 = 27 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{46}{b} + b^2 = 27 \\]\nMultiply both sides by \\( b \\):\n\\[ 46 + b^3 = 27b \\]\n\\[ b^3 - 27b + 46 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve the cubic equation \\( b^3 - 27b + 46 = 0 \\).\n\nLet's try rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 46, so \\( \\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm23, \\pm46 \\).\n\nTry \\( b = 2 \\):\n\\[ 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 \\]\nYes, \\( b = 2 \\) is a root.\n\nNow, perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out \\( (b - 2) \\):\n\\[ b^3 - 27b + 46 = (b - 2)(b^2 + 2b - 23) \\]\n\nNow, solve \\( b^2 + 2b - 23 = 0 \\):\n\\[ b = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 92}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{96}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 4\\sqrt{6}}{2} = -1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{6} \\]\n\nSo, the roots are \\( b = 2 \\), \\( b = -1 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\), and \\( b = -1 - 2\\sqrt{6} \\).\n\nSince dimensions are positive, \\( b = 2 \\) or \\( b = -1 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\).\n\nFirst, let's take \\( b = 2 \\):\n\\[ a = \\frac{23}{b^2} = \\frac{23}{4} \\]\n\\[ c = b = 2 \\]\n\nNow, check the surface area:\n\\[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 2\\left(\\frac{23}{4} \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 + \\frac{23}{4} \\cdot 2\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{46}{4} + 4 + \\frac{46}{4}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{92}{4} + 4\\right) = 2(23 + 4) = 2(27) = 54 \\]\n\nYes, it satisfies the surface area condition.\n\nNow, compute \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\):\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \\left(\\frac{23}{4}\\right)^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = \\frac{529}{16} + 4 + 4 = \\frac{529}{16} + 8 = \\frac{529 + 128}{16} = \\frac{657}{16} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4} = \\frac{657}{16 \\times 4} = \\frac{657}{64} \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\frac{657}{64} \\) is already in lowest terms since 657 and 64 share no common divisors other than 1.\n\nThus, \\( p = 657 \\) and \\( q = 64 \\), so \\( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \\).\n\nBut wait, I assumed \\( b = c \\). What if \\( b = -1 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\)?\n\nLet's check that case.\n\nTake \\( b = -1 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\):\n\\[ a = \\frac{23}{b^2} = \\frac{23}{(-1 + 2\\sqrt{6})^2} = \\frac{23}{1 - 4\\sqrt{6} + 24} = \\frac{23}{25 - 4\\sqrt{6}} \\]\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\\[ a = \\frac{23(25 + 4\\sqrt{6})}{(25 - 4\\sqrt{6})(25 + 4\\sqrt{6})} = \\frac{23(25 + 4\\sqrt{6})}{625 - 96} = \\frac{23(25 + 4\\sqrt{6})}{529} = \\frac{25 + 4\\sqrt{6}}{23} \\]\n\nNow, \\( c = b = -1 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\)\n\nCompute \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\):\n\\[ a^2 = \\left(\\frac{25 + 4\\sqrt{6}}{23}\\right)^2 = \\frac{625 + 200\\sqrt{6} + 96}{529} = \\frac{721 + 200\\sqrt{6}}{529} \\]\n\\[ b^2 = (-1 + 2\\sqrt{6})^2 = 1 - 4\\sqrt{6} + 24 = 25 - 4\\sqrt{6} \\]\n\\[ c^2 = b^2 = 25 - 4\\sqrt{6} \\]\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = \\frac{721 + 200\\sqrt{6}}{529} + 25 - 4\\sqrt{6} + 25 - 4\\sqrt{6} = \\frac{721 + 200\\sqrt{6}}{529} + 50 - 8\\sqrt{6} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{721 + 200\\sqrt{6} + 50 \\times 529 - 8\\sqrt{6} \\times 529}{529} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{721 + 200\\sqrt{6} + 26450 - 4232\\sqrt{6}}{529} \\]\n\\[ = \\frac{27171 - 4032\\sqrt{6}}{529} \\]\n\nThis seems messy, and I suspect that the first case \\( b = 2 \\) gives the minimal \\( r^2 \\). Therefore, I'll proceed with \\( r^2 = \\frac{657}{64} \\).\n\nThus, \\( p = 657 \\) and \\( q = 64 \\), so \\( p + q = 721 \\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{721}\\)"
