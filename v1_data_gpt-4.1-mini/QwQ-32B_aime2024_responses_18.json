        "question": "Let $\\triangle ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$ with $\\overline{IA}\\perp\\overline{OI}$, circumradius $13$, and inradius $6$. Find $AB\\cdot AC$.",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here: In triangle ABC, the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties about triangles, circumcenters, incenters, and maybe some formulas that relate these elements. Since the problem involves both the circumradius (R = 13) and the inradius (r = 6), I might need to use formulas that connect these with other elements of the triangle, like sides, area, etc.\n\nThe fact that IA is perpendicular to OI seems important. I remember that in a triangle, the incenter and circumcenter have certain relations, but I don't recall a specific theorem about IA being perpendicular to OI. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry here? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. Wait, yes! There's a formula that connects the distance OI (between the circumcenter and incenter) with R, r, and the angle at the vertex. Let me recall that formula.\n\nI think the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r cos \u03b8), where \u03b8 is some angle? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact formula. Let me recall: actually, the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, no, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, I remember Euler's formula which states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm. Euler's formula in triangle geometry is indeed OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, so that would be OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, so if that's the case, then OI is sqrt(R\u00b2 - 2Rr). But in this problem, we have an additional condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. So maybe this condition can be used to relate some other terms?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up coordinates. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system in such a way that calculations can be simplified.\n\nLet me consider placing point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can set up coordinates so that the line OI is along the y-axis or x-axis? Hmm, perhaps that's a good idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to place the circumcenter O at the origin. Let me think. If I place O at (0,0), then the coordinates of A, B, C will lie on the circumference of a circle with radius 13. The incenter I has coordinates ( (aA + bB + cC)/ (a + b + c) ), but maybe that's getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector coordinates? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. So their dot product is zero. If I can express vectors IA and OI in terms of coordinates, maybe I can set up an equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric identities. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area and s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R = (a b c)/(4\u0394). Also, the distance between O and I is given by Euler's formula: OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, so if that's the case, then OI = sqrt(R\u00b2 - 2Rr). Let me compute that with R =13 and r=6.\n\nSo OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, interesting. But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA?\n\nWait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at A. Therefore, by Pythagoras, OA\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2. Wait, but OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA = 13. Then, OI\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Wait, but according to Euler's formula, OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr = 169 - 156 = 13. But according to the right triangle, OI\u00b2 should be OA\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Therefore, 13 = 13\u00b2 + IA\u00b2? Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, maybe I got the triangle wrong.\n\nWait, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then the right angle is at A, so the triangle is OIA with right angle at A. Therefore, OA\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2. But OA is 13, IA is the inradius distance from A to I? Wait, no, IA is the distance from vertex A to the incenter I, which is not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, not to the vertex.\n\nAh, right, so IA is not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to side BC, for example. So IA is the length from vertex A to the incenter I. So that's different. So in that case, we can write OA\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2? Wait, but according to Euler's formula, OI\u00b2 is 13, but OA is 13, so 13\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 13? That would mean IA\u00b2 is negative, which is impossible. So clearly, my assumption is wrong here.\n\nHmm, so maybe the right angle is not at A? Wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So the line IA is perpendicular to the line OI. So the lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees. So the triangle OIA has a right angle at the point where the two lines meet. Wait, IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is a segment from O to I. So the angle at I between OI and IA is 90 degrees? Wait, no, the lines IA and OI are perpendicular, so the angle between them is 90 degrees. Since both lines meet at point I? Wait, IA is from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So the angle at I between IA and OI is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2. Because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse squared equals the sum of the other two sides squared. Here, OA is the hypotenuse because the right angle is at I. So OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, OA is the circumradius, so OA = 13. Then, OI\u00b2 is given by Euler's formula as 13 (since R=13, r=6: 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13). Therefore, OI\u00b2 =13. Therefore, OA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 => 169 =13 + IA\u00b2 => IA\u00b2 = 169 -13 = 156 => IA = sqrt(156). So IA is sqrt(156). Hmm, okay, so that gives us the length of IA in terms of the given R and r. Interesting.\n\nSo now, perhaps we can relate IA to other elements of the triangle. Let me recall that the distance from the vertex A to the incenter I can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle and the angles. Let me think.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the distance from a vertex to the incenter can be given by the formula:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nIs that correct? Let me recall. The inradius r is related to the distances from the incenter to the sides, but the distance from the vertex to the incenter might involve trigonometric functions of the angles.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the length of the angle bisector? Hmm, maybe not directly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AIB, but perhaps it's better to use trigonometric relations.\n\nYes, I think the formula for the distance from the vertex to the incenter is IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}. Let me verify this.\n\nIn the incenter, the angle bisector of angle A splits the angle into two angles of measure A/2. The inradius is the distance from I to side BC, which is r. If we consider the right triangle formed by the incenter I, the point where the incircle touches BC, and the vertex A's angle bisector, then in that right triangle, the distance IA would be the hypotenuse, and the opposite side to angle A/2 is r. Therefore, sin(A/2) = r / IA => IA = r / sin(A/2). Yes, that seems correct. So IA = r / sin(A/2). Therefore, IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 / sin\u00b2(A/2). So from earlier, IA\u00b2 = 156, so 156 = 36 / sin\u00b2(A/2) => sin\u00b2(A/2) = 36 / 156 = 3/13. Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - 3/13) = sqrt(10/13). Therefore, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(3/13) = 1 - 6/13 = 7/13. So angle A has cosine 7/13. Therefore, cos A = 7/13. That's useful.\n\nSo angle A is known in terms of its cosine. Let me note that down: cos A = 7/13.\n\nNow, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC. Let me denote the sides as follows: let AB = c, AC = b, BC = a. Then, by the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A.\n\nBut we need to find AB * AC, which is c * b. So if I can find b and c, or find an expression that gives bc, that would be helpful.\n\nAlso, since we know the circumradius R =13, we can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that a / sin A = 2R = 26. Therefore, a = 26 sin A. Since we know cos A =7/13, sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13. Therefore, sin A = 2\u221a30 /13. Therefore, a = 26*(2\u221a30)/13 = 4\u221a30. So BC = a = 4\u221a30.\n\nSo we have side BC = 4\u221a30. Now, we need to find AB * AC = c * b.\n\nWe also know the inradius r =6. The formula for the inradius is r = \u0394/s, where \u0394 is the area of the triangle and s is the semiperimeter: s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlso, the area can be expressed as \u0394 = (1/2)ab sin C, but maybe more useful here is \u0394 = r*s. Since r =6, so \u0394 =6s.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula \u0394 = (a b c)/(4 R). Since R is known, 13. So \u0394 = (a b c)/(4*13). Therefore, 6s = (a b c)/(52). Hmm, so that's another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles: \u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A. Since we know sin A, that could be helpful.\n\nLet me write down the equations I have so far:\n\n1. a = 4\u221a30 (from Law of Sines)\n2. cos A =7/13, so sin A = 2\u221a30/13\n3. \u0394 = (1/2) b c sin A = (1/2) b c (2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13\n4. Also, \u0394 = r*s =6*( (a + b + c)/2 ) = 3(a + b + c)\n5. So equate the two expressions for \u0394: (b c \u221a30)/13 = 3(a + b + c)\n6. Also, from the Law of Cosines: a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c cos A. Since a is known, we can write:\n\n(4\u221a30)^2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2 b c*(7/13)\n\nCalculating left side: 16*30 = 480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c\n\nSo equation 7: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) b c = 480\n\nNow, equation 5: (b c \u221a30)/13 = 3(a + b + c). Let me note that a is 4\u221a30, so substituting:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 = 3(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\nLet me denote bc as x (the product we need to find), and let me denote b + c as y. Then, equation 5 becomes:\n\n(x \u221a30)/13 = 3(4\u221a30 + y) => (x \u221a30)/13 = 12\u221a30 + 3y => Let's divide both sides by \u221a30:\n\nx /13 = 12 + 3y /\u221a30\n\nHmm, but this introduces y = b + c. Maybe this is getting too convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps express equation 5 as:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 - 3(b + c) = 12\u221a30\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me see if I can find another relation.\n\nWe also have equation 7: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc = 480. Let me note that b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 can be written as (b + c)^2 - 2 bc. So substituting:\n\n(b + c)^2 - 2 bc - (14/13) bc = 480\n\nSo (b + c)^2 - (2 + 14/13) bc = 480\n\nCalculating 2 + 14/13 = (26 +14)/13 = 40/13. Therefore,\n\n(b + c)^2 - (40/13) bc = 480\n\nLet me denote bc = x and b + c = y again. Then:\n\ny\u00b2 - (40/13)x = 480 --> equation 7a.\n\nFrom equation 5:\n\n(x \u221a30)/13 = 3(4\u221a30 + y)\n\nLet me rearrange equation 5 to express y in terms of x:\n\nMultiply both sides by 13/\u221a30:\n\nx = 13/\u221a30 * 3(4\u221a30 + y) = 13*3*(4\u221a30 + y)/\u221a30\n\nWait, perhaps better to solve for y:\n\nStarting from equation 5:\n\n(x \u221a30)/13 - 3y = 12\u221a30\n\nSo,\n\n-3y = 12\u221a30 - (x \u221a30)/13\n\nMultiply both sides by (-1/3):\n\ny = -4\u221a30 + (x \u221a30)/(13*3) = -4\u221a30 + (x \u221a30)/39\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = (x \u221a30)/39 - 4\u221a30\n\nSo y = \u221a30 (x/39 - 4)\n\nSo now, substitute this into equation 7a:\n\ny\u00b2 - (40/13)x = 480\n\nFirst, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = [\u221a30 (x/39 - 4)]\u00b2 = 30*(x/39 -4)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\n30*(x/39 -4)^2 - (40/13)x = 480\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n30*( (x/39 -4)^2 ) - (40/13)x = 480\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's try to simplify step by step.\n\nFirst, let me let z = x/39. Then x = 39 z. Let me substitute:\n\n30*( z -4 )\u00b2 - (40/13)(39 z) = 480\n\nCompute the second term: (40/13)(39 z) = 40*3 z = 120 z\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n30*(z -4)^2 - 120 z = 480\n\nExpand (z -4)^2:\n\n(z\u00b2 -8z +16)\n\nMultiply by 30:\n\n30 z\u00b2 - 240 z + 480 -120 z = 480\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n30 z\u00b2 - (240 z + 120 z) + 480 = 480\n\nSo,\n\n30 z\u00b2 - 360 z + 480 = 480\n\nSubtract 480 from both sides:\n\n30 z\u00b2 - 360 z = 0\n\nFactor out 30 z:\n\n30 z (z - 12) =0\n\nTherefore, solutions are z =0 or z =12. Since z = x/39, and x = bc is a product of sides, it can't be zero. So z =12, so x =39*12 = 468.\n\nTherefore, bc = x = 468. So AB * AC = bc = 468. Wait, so is that the answer? Let me check.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify this because sometimes substitution can lead to errors. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nWe set z = x/39, so x =39 z. Then substituted into the equation:\n\n30*(z -4)^2 - (40/13)(39 z) = 480\n\nYes, (40/13)(39 z) is indeed 40*3 z = 120 z. Then expanding 30*(z\u00b2 -8z +16) gives 30 z\u00b2 -240 z +480. Then subtract 120 z gives 30 z\u00b2 - 360 z +480. Set equal to 480, subtract 480, get 30 z\u00b2 -360 z =0, factor to 30 z(z -12)=0. So z=12, so x=39*12=468. So bc=468. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468? Let me check with another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if with bc=468, the other equations hold.\n\nFirst, bc=468. Then, from equation 7a:\n\ny\u00b2 - (40/13)x =480, where y = b + c, x = bc=468.\n\nSo y\u00b2 - (40/13)*468 = y\u00b2 - (40*36) = y\u00b2 -1440 =480. Therefore, y\u00b2 = 1920, so y = sqrt(1920)=sqrt(64*30)=8*sqrt(30). So b + c =8\u221a30.\n\nThen from equation 5:\n\n(x \u221a30)/13 =3(a + b + c). Since a=4\u221a30, so a + b + c =4\u221a30 +8\u221a30=12\u221a30. Therefore, 3*(12\u221a30)=36\u221a30.\n\nLeft side: (468 *\u221a30)/13 = 36*\u221a30. Which matches. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are consistent. Therefore, the product AB * AC is 468. Therefore, the answer is 468. Wait, but let me check once more with another formula.\n\nAlternatively, since we know angle A, sides b and c, and the Law of Cosines, perhaps we can compute the area in two ways.\n\nWe had \u0394 = (b c sin A)/2 = (468 * (2\u221a30/13))/2. Let's compute that:\n\nFirst, 468 divided by 13 is 36. So 468*(2\u221a30)/13 = 36*2\u221a30 =72\u221a30. Then divided by 2 gives 36\u221a30. So area is 36\u221a30.\n\nAlternatively, using inradius formula: \u0394 = r*s =6*s. Since s=(a +b +c)/2 = (4\u221a30 +8\u221a30)/2 = (12\u221a30)/2=6\u221a30. Therefore, 6*s =6*(6\u221a30)=36\u221a30. Which matches. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, all the equations are consistent, so the answer is 468. Hmm, so I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nWe started with the given conditions, used Euler's formula for OI\u00b2, realized that the right angle is at I, so applied Pythagoras to get IA in terms of R and OI, then found IA in terms of angle A, leading us to find cos A. Then using Law of Sines found side a, then set up equations with Law of Cosines and area formulas, solved for bc, and confirmed the answer through substitution. All steps check out, so I think 468 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n</think>\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\) and incenter \\( I \\), where \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), and inradius \\( r = 6 \\).
