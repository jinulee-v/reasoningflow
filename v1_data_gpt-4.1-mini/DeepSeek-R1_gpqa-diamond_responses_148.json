        "question": "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\nA.

        "response": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, similar shifts, integrals add up to 1H. LC-MS at elevated temp shows two peaks with same mass. Both have same mass spectrum as expected.\n\nFirst, let's break down the info. The NMR has two peaks for the same proton. They aren't splitting each other because coupling is ruled out. So maybe two environments? But why? Diastereomers would have different physical properties, so maybe separate in LC-MS? But LC-MS here shows two peaks with same mass. Wait, enantiomers have same mass but different optical activity. But LC-MS might not separate enantiomers unless using a chiral column. However, the question says LC-MS at elevated temp shows two peaks. If the column isn't chiral, enantiomers would co-elute. But here they are separated. So maybe diastereomers? But diastereomers have different masses if they are different compounds, but here the mass is same. Wait, same mass but different structures? That's possible if they are stereoisomers. Wait, enantiomers have same mass. Diastereomers could have same mass if they are epimers or something. Wait, but diastereomers would have different physical properties, so maybe different retention times. But enantiomers would require a chiral column to separate. If the LC column isn't chiral, then enantiomers would come out as one peak. But here, two peaks. So maybe the LC method here uses a chiral column? The question doesn't specify. Hmm.\n\nWait, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with same mass. If the mass is same, then it's same molecular formula. So enantiomers have same molecular formula. Diastereomers can have same molecular formula if they are stereoisomers but not mirror images. But if the compound has two stereocenters, maybe forming diastereomers. Wait, but the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Alpha-proton is adjacent to the amino group in amino acids. If there's a stereocenter at the alpha carbon, then maybe there's a mixture of R and S configurations. But if the compound is synthesized chemically, unless there was a racemic mixture formed. Wait, chemical synthesis without using chiral reagents or catalysts would lead to racemic mixtures. But peptides are usually synthesized using methods that control stereochemistry, like using protected amino acids with correct configuration. Unless there was some epimerization during synthesis.\n\nWait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. If the compound exists as two diastereomers, then the alpha-protons would be in different environments, leading to different shifts. But diastereomers would have different physical properties, so LC would separate them. But LC-MS here shows two peaks with same mass. So same molecular weight. So enantiomers would have same mass, but diastereomers could also have same mass if they are stereoisomers. Wait, enantiomers are a type of stereoisomer that are non-superimposable mirror images. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers. So, for example, cis and trans isomers are diastereomers. But in peptides, if there's a proline residue, maybe cis-trans isomerism? But proline cis-trans would lead to different structures. Wait, but cis-trans isomerism around an amide bond. The amide bond is usually trans, but sometimes can have cis, especially with proline. But that's a possibility. If the compound has a proline or another residue where the amide bond can isomerize between cis and trans, then you would have two diastereomers. The cis and trans would have different physical properties, so LC would separate them. And their masses would be same. The NMR would show different shifts for protons in different environments. For example, the alpha-proton adjacent to the amide bond might be in different environments in cis vs trans, leading to two peaks. But wait, the question says the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So maybe the alpha-proton is in a position where its environment changes based on cis-trans isomerism. But cis-trans isomerism would lead to diastereomers. So answer A or D?\n\nBut enantiomers would have same physical properties except for optical activity. So LC might not separate them unless the column is chiral. If the LC method uses a reverse-phase column, which is not chiral, enantiomers would co-elute. But here, two peaks. So maybe it's cis-trans isomerism (diastereomers), which would separate on regular LC. And their NMR would show different shifts. So answer A.\n\nAlternatively, if there's some epimerization at a chiral center, leading to diastereomers. For example, if during synthesis, a stereocenter was racemized, creating a mixture of two diastereomers (if there's another stereocenter elsewhere). Wait, but if there's only one stereocenter, then racemization would lead to enantiomers. But if there are multiple stereocenters, changing one would lead to diastereomers. But the question says the LC-MS shows same mass. So same molecular formula. So enantiomers or diastereomers with same molecular formula.\n\nWait, the options are A (diastereoisomers) or D (enantiomers). The LC separates them into two peaks. If the LC method is chiral, then enantiomers would separate. But standard LC columns are not chiral. So unless specified, maybe the LC here is using a chiral column. But the question doesn't say that. Alternatively, the two peaks could be due to something else. Wait, the LC-MS at elevated temperature. Maybe heating causes some on-column racemization? No, but the peaks are defined. Wait, maybe the compound is undergoing some conformational change. But the fact that LC-MS shows two peaks suggests they are separate entities. If they are enantiomers, and the column is chiral, then they would separate. But if the column isn't chiral, they wouldn't. So if the LC method here is using a standard column (not chiral), then two peaks with same mass would suggest diastereomers. Because diastereomers have different physical properties and can separate on regular LC. So answer A.\n\nBut wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. If the compound is a diastereomer, then the alpha-proton would be in different environments. For example, if there's another stereocenter elsewhere, the alpha-proton's environment would differ between the two diastereomers. So that would explain the NMR. And LC would separate them. So answer A.\n\nAlternatively, if it's enantiomers, the alpha-proton in each enantiomer would be in mirror-image environments. But in NMR, enantiomers typically have identical spectra because the environment is mirrored but the NMR can't distinguish. Wait, but wait, in an achiral environment, enantiomers have identical NMR spectra. But if the solvent is chiral or if there's a chiral shift reagent, then they might split. But under normal conditions, enantiomers would have the same NMR. So the fact that there are two peaks for the same proton in NMR suggests that they are not enantiomers, but diastereomers. Because diastereomers have different physical environments, leading to different shifts. So answer A.\n\nSo the correct answer is A. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers."
