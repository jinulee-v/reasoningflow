        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given these three logarithmic equations with variables x, y, and z. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right.\n\nThe system is:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms with base 2. Since all the equations are in terms of log base 2, maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make it easier to handle. Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo now I have three equations expressing x/(y z), y/(x z), and z/(x y) in terms of powers of 2. The variables x, y, z are all in the denominators and numerators, so maybe I can manipulate these equations to solve for x, y, z or find a relationship between them.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem asks for log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2), perhaps I can find the exponents of x, y, z in terms of the given equations and combine them. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take all three equations and multiply them together in some way to get an equation involving x, y, z. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me denote the three equations as follows for clarity:\n\nEquation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)\n\nEquation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)\n\nEquation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)\n\nIf I multiply all three equations together, the left-hand sides would be:\n\n(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) \n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, multiply the first two fractions:\n\n(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) = (x * y) / (y z * x z) = (x y) / (x y z\u00b2) = 1 / z\u00b2\n\nThen multiply that by the third equation's left-hand side:\n\n(1 / z\u00b2) * (z / (x y)) = (1 * z) / (z\u00b2 * x y) = 1 / (z x y)\n\nSo the left-hand side product is 1/(x y z). The right-hand side is 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4). Since they have the same base, we can add exponents:\n\n2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute that exponent:\n\nFirst, find a common denominator for 2, 3, 4. The least common denominator is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So adding them up: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.\n\nTherefore, the product of the right-hand sides is 2^(13/12). \n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)\n\nTherefore, x y z = 2^(-13/12). \n\nHmm, that's an equation involving the product x y z. Maybe that will be useful later. Let me note that down:\n\nEquation (4): x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nNow, perhaps I can solve for each variable in terms of the others using the original equations and substitute into this product equation. Let me see.\n\nFrom Equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n\nFrom Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n\nFrom Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the product of the other two variables multiplied by a power of 2. Maybe substituting these into each other?\n\nLet me try substituting x from Equation (1) into Equation (2). Let's see:\n\nFrom Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. But x is 2^(1/2) y z, so substituting:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) y z) * z\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) * y z * z = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) * y z\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\ny = 2^( (2/6 + 3/6) ) * y z\u00b2 = 2^(5/6) * y z\u00b2\n\nHmm, so we have y = 2^(5/6) * y z\u00b2. Let me divide both sides by y (assuming y \u2260 0, which it is positive as per the problem statement):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z\u00b2\n\nTherefore, z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTherefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo z = 2^(-5/12). Okay, so that gives us z. Let me note that down.\n\nz = 2^(-5/12)\n\nNow, let's see if we can find y and x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe substitute into Equation (4). Since we have x y z = 2^(-13/12), and we know z, perhaps we can find x y?\n\nWait, but maybe let's try another substitution. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's use Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Since we found z = 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nTherefore, x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me note that as Equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nNow, from Equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Since we know z = 2^(-5/12), substitute that in:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/2 - 5/12) * y\n\nCompute exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12. So:\n\nx = 2^(1/12) * y\n\nTherefore, x = 2^(1/12) y. Let me note that as Equation (6): x = 2^(1/12) y\n\nNow, since we have x in terms of y, and we have x y from Equation (5), let's substitute x into Equation (5):\n\nx y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nBut x = 2^(1/12) y, so substituting:\n\n2^(1/12) y * y = 2^(-2/3)\n\nSo 2^(1/12) y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3)\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 -1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive, we take the positive root.\n\nSo y = 2^(-3/8). Got that. Now, using Equation (6), x = 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8)\n\nCompute exponent: 1/12 - 3/8. Let's convert to 24 denominators:\n\n1/12 = 2/24, 3/8 = 9/24. So 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24. Therefore, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSo x = 2^(-7/24). Alright, so now we have x, y, z all expressed as exponents of 2. Let me recap:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24) [since 3/8 = 9/24]\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24) [since 5/12 = 10/24]\n\nWait, let me confirm that:\n\nWait, 3/8 is 9/24? Yes, 3*3=9, 8*3=24. Similarly, 5/12 is 10/24. Correct.\n\nSo, x is -7/24, y is -9/24, z is -10/24. Hmm, interesting. Let me check if these satisfy the product x y z:\n\nx y z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(- (7+9+10)/24 ) = 2^(-26/24) = 2^(-13/12), which matches Equation (4). Good, that checks out.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Let me compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) first.\n\nSince x, y, z are all powers of 2, their product will also be a power of 2, so log base 2 of that product will just be the exponent. Let me compute the exponent.\n\nFirst, express x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 as:\n\n(2^(-7/24))\u2074 * (2^(-9/24))\u00b3 * (2^(-10/24))\u00b2\n\nMultiply those together by adding exponents:\n\nExponent for x\u2074: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24\n\nExponent for y\u00b3: 3*(-9/24) = -27/24\n\nExponent for z\u00b2: 2*(-10/24) = -20/24\n\nTotal exponent: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nTherefore, x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-75/24). Therefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -75/24.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value of that, so | -75/24 | = 75/24. Simplify that fraction.\n\n75 and 24 have a common divisor of 3. 75 \u00f7 3 = 25, 24 \u00f73 = 8. So 75/24 = 25/8. 25 and 8 are coprime, so m =25, n=8, so m +n = 33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the exponents again:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24). So x\u2074 exponent is 4*(-7/24) = -28/24.\n\ny = 2^(-9/24). So y\u00b3 exponent is 3*(-9/24) = -27/24.\n\nz = 2^(-10/24). So z\u00b2 exponent is 2*(-10/24) = -20/24.\n\nAdding those exponents: -28 -27 -20 = -75. Divided by 24, so exponent is -75/24. So log\u2082 is indeed -75/24, absolute value is 75/24, reduces to 25/8. So 25 +8 is 33. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in solving for x, y, z.\n\nStarting again, let's see:\n\nFrom Equation (1): x/(y z) = 2^(1/2). So x = 2^(1/2) y z.\n\nEquation (2): y/(x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = 2^(1/3) x z.\n\nEquation (3): z/(x y) = 2^(1/4). So z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nMultiplying all three equations gives 1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12), so x y z = 2^(-13/12). That's correct.\n\nThen, when I substituted x from Equation (1) into Equation (2):\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x z = 2^(1/3)*(2^(1/2) y z)* z = 2^(1/3 +1/2) y z\u00b2. Then, 1/3 +1/2 is 5/6, so 2^(5/6) y z\u00b2 = y. Then, cancelling y gives 1 = 2^(5/6) z\u00b2, so z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). That's correct.\n\nThen, using Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y. So substituting z = 2^(-5/12):\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y. Therefore, x y = 2^(-5/12 - 1/4). Converting 1/4 to 3/12, so exponent is -5/12 -3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3. So x y = 2^(-2/3). Correct.\n\nThen, from Equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z. Substituting z = 2^(-5/12):\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(6/12 -5/12) * y = 2^(1/12) y. So x = 2^(1/12) y. Then, substituting into x y = 2^(-2/3):\n\n2^(1/12) y * y = 2^(-2/3). So 2^(1/12) y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3). Therefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3 -1/12). Converting -2/3 to -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4. So y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Correct.\n\nThen x = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8). Converting to 24 denominator:\n\n1/12 = 2/24, 3/8 = 9/24. So 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24. So x = 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\nTherefore, all variables are correctly found. Then, computing x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2:\n\nx\u2074 exponent: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24\n\ny\u00b3 exponent: 3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -27/24\n\nz\u00b2 exponent: 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: -28 -27 -20 over 24: total numerator -75, so exponent -75/24. Absolute value 75/24 reduces to 25/8. So 25 +8 is 33. \n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by setting variables as exponents of 2 from the start. Let me see.\n\nSuppose we let x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c. Then, since log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2,\n\nlog\u2082(2^a / (2^b * 2^c)) = log\u2082(2^{a - b - c}) = a - b - c = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y/(x z)) = log\u2082(2^b / (2^a * 2^c)) = log\u2082(2^{b - a - c}) = b - a - c = 1/3.\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog\u2082(z/(x y)) = log\u2082(2^c / (2^a * 2^b)) = log\u2082(2^{c - a - b}) = c - a - b = 1/4.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the system of equations in terms of a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nSo now we have three linear equations with three variables. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, this might be a more straightforward approach. Let me try solving this system.\n\nLet me denote the equations as:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nLet me try adding all three equations together. Let's see:\n\nLeft-hand sides: (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) =\n\na - b - c -a + b - c -a - b + c =\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na -a -a = -a\n\n-b + b - b = -b\n\n-c -c + c = -c\n\nSo total left-hand side: -a - b - c\n\nRight-hand sides: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let me compute that:\n\nConvert to 12ths: 6/12 + 4/12 + 3/12 = 13/12\n\nTherefore, -a - b - c = 13/12\n\nBut from Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2. Let me write that as Equation 1.\n\nLet me call the sum of equations (Equation 4): -a - b - c = 13/12\n\nSo now, from Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nFrom Equation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12\n\nLet me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 4:\n\n(-a - b - c) - (a - b - c) = 13/12 - 1/2\n\nLeft-hand side: -a - b - c -a + b + c = -2a\n\nRight-hand side: 13/12 - 6/12 = 7/12\n\nTherefore, -2a = 7/12 => a = -7/24\n\nSo a = -7/24. Okay, that's the same as before, since x was 2^(-7/24). Good.\n\nNow, let's find b and c. Let's use Equation 1 and Equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2. Since a is known, plug in:\n\n-7/24 - b - c = 1/2\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n- b - c = 1/2 + 7/24 = 12/24 +7/24 = 19/24\n\nSo, - (b + c) = 19/24 => b + c = -19/24. Let's note that as Equation 5.\n\nSimilarly, take Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nPlug in a = -7/24:\n\n-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 => 7/24 + b - c = 1/3\n\nSo, b - c = 1/3 -7/24 = 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24. Let's note that as Equation 6: b - c = 1/24\n\nNow, we have:\n\nEquation 5: b + c = -19/24\n\nEquation 6: b - c = 1/24\n\nAdding Equations 5 and 6:\n\n(b + c) + (b - c) = (-19/24) + (1/24)\n\n2b = (-18/24) => 2b = -3/4 => b = -3/8. Which is -9/24, same as before. So that's consistent with y = 2^(-3/8). Good.\n\nThen, from Equation 5: b + c = -19/24, so c = -19/24 - b = -19/24 - (-9/24) = (-19 +9)/24 = -10/24 = -5/12. Which is the same as z = 2^(-5/12). Perfect.\n\nTherefore, this method also gives the same exponents. So, the previous calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) is indeed -75/24, so the absolute value is 75/24 = 25/8, so m + n is 33. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) using the exponents a, b, c.\n\nSince x = 2^a, y = 2^b, z = 2^c,\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = (2^a)^4 * (2^b)^3 * (2^c)^2 = 2^{4a + 3b + 2c}\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nCompute that:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24\n\n3b = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24\n\n2c = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24\n\nAdding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = -75/24. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25/8, so 25 + 8 = 33. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here, and both methods of substitution and converting to exponents give the same result. So I'm confident the answer is 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n</think>\n\nGiven the system of equations involving logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nwe convert these equations to their exponential forms:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \\)\n3. \\( \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \\)\n\nMultiplying these three equations together, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{yz} \\cdot \\frac{y}{xz} \\cdot \\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/2} \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\cdot 2^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left-hand side, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the exponent on the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{13}{12}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12} \\implies xyz = 2^{-13/12}\n\\]\n\nNext, we express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) in terms of powers of 2.

Hmm, that seems right.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistake in solving for x, y, z.\n\nStarting again, let's see:\n\nFrom Equation (1): x/(y z) = 2^(1/2). So x = 2^(1/2) y z.\n\nEquation (2): y/(x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = 2^(1/3) x z.\n\nEquation (3): z/(x y) = 2^(1/4). So z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nMultiplying all three equations gives 1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12), so x y z = 2^(-13/12). That's correct.\n\nThen, when I substituted x from Equation (1) into Equation (2):\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x z = 2^(1/3)*(2^(1/2) y z)* z = 2^(1/3 +1/2) y z\u00b2. Then, 1/3 +1/2 is 5/6, so 2^(5/6) y z\u00b2 = y. Then, cancelling y gives 1 = 2^(5/6) z\u00b2, so z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). That's correct.\n\nThen, using Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y. So substituting z = 2^(-5/12):\n\n2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y. Therefore, x y = 2^(-5/12 - 1/4). Converting 1/4 to 3/12, so exponent is -5/12 -3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3. So x y = 2^(-2/3). Correct.\n\nThen, from Equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z. Substituting z = 2^(-5/12):\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(6/12 -5/12) * y = 2^(1/12) y. So x = 2^(1/12) y. Then, substituting into x y = 2^(-2/3):\n\n2^(1/12) y * y = 2^(-2/3). So 2^(1/12) y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3). Therefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3 -1/12). Converting -2/3 to -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4. So y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Correct.\n\nThen x = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8). Converting to 24 denominator:\n\n1/12 = 2/24, 3/8 = 9/24. So 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24. So x = 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\nTherefore, all variables are correctly found. Then, computing x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2:\n\nx\u2074 exponent: 4*(-7/24) = -28/24\n\ny\u00b3 exponent: 3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -27/24\n\nz\u00b2 exponent: 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -20/24\n\nAdding them: -28 -27 -20 over 24: total numerator -75, so exponent -75/24. Absolute value 75/24 reduces to 25/8. So 25 +8 is 33. \n\n",
