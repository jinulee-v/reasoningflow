        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman effect term) with the transition energy \u0394E of a Hydrogen atom corresponding to a wavelength of 0.4861 \u03bcm. The options are whether the expectation value of the Hamiltonian H is equal to, much less than, greater than, or much greater than \u0394E. \n\nFirst, let me recall what the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is. In the presence of a magnetic field, the Hamiltonian gets an additional term due to the Zeeman effect. The paramagnetic term is the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The formula for this term is H_para = -\u03bc\u00b7B, where \u03bc is the magnetic moment of the electron. For an electron, the magnetic moment is given by \u03bc = - (e/(2m_e)) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So, putting that together, the paramagnetic term should be H_para = (e/(2m_e)) * L\u00b7B. Since the magnetic field is along the Oz axis, this simplifies to H_para = (eB/(2m_e)) * L_z. \n\nThe expectation value of H_para would then be \u27e8H_para\u27e9 = (eB/(2m_e)) * \u27e8L_z\u27e9. Since we're dealing with small values of the orbital magnetic quantum number m, \u27e8L_z\u27e9 is m\u0127, where m is small (like m=0, \u00b11, maybe \u00b12). So \u27e8H_para\u27e9 \u2248 (eB\u0127/(2m_e)) * m. \n\nNow, let's compute the numerical value of this term. Let's plug in the constants:\n\ne is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602\u00d710^-19 C.\nB is given as 1 T.\n\u0127 is the reduced Planck's constant, about 1.055\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s.\nm_e is the electron mass, 9.11\u00d710^-31 kg.\n\nSo, eB\u0127/(2m_e) = (1.602\u00d710^-19 C)(1 T)(1.055\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s)/(2 * 9.11\u00d710^-31 kg). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, numerator: 1.602\u00d710^-19 * 1.055\u00d710^-34 \u2248 1.602*1.055 \u00d7 10^-53 \u2248 1.690\u00d710^-53.\n\nDenominator: 2 * 9.11\u00d710^-31 \u2248 1.822\u00d710^-30.\n\nSo overall, 1.690\u00d710^-53 / 1.822\u00d710^-30 \u2248 (1.690/1.822) \u00d7 10^-23 \u2248 approximately 0.927 \u00d7 10^-23 \u2248 9.27\u00d710^-24 J.\n\nBut wait, let me check the units. Let's see:\n\nThe units for eB\u0127/(2m_e):\n\ne has units of C (Coulombs).\n\nB is Tesla, which is kg/(s\u00b7C) because 1 T = 1 kg/(s\u00b2\u00b7A) and since A = C/s, so 1 T = 1 kg/(s\u00b7C).\n\n\u0127 has units of J\u00b7s = (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2)\u00b7s = kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ne (C) * B (kg/(s\u00b7C)) * \u0127 (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s) / (2m_e (kg)).\n\nSo units:\n\nC * (kg/(s\u00b7C)) * (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s) / kg = (kg/(s)) * (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s) / kg = (kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2) = J.\n\nSo yes, the units are correct. So the term is in Joules. So \u27e8H_para\u27e9 \u2248 9.27\u00d710^-24 J * m. Since m is small, let's take m=1 for the maximum possible value. So \u27e8H_para\u27e9 \u2248 9.27\u00d710^-24 J.\n\nNow, let's compute the transition energy \u0394E. The wavelength given is \u03bb=0.4861 \u03bcm, which is 0.4861\u00d710^-6 m. The energy of a photon with this wavelength is E = hc/\u03bb. Let's compute that.\n\nh is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s.\n\nc is the speed of light, 3\u00d710^8 m/s.\n\nSo E = (6.626\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s)(3\u00d710^8 m/s)/(0.4861\u00d710^-6 m).\n\nFirst, numerator: 6.626\u00d710^-34 * 3\u00d710^8 \u2248 1.9878\u00d710^-25 J\u00b7m.\n\nDenominator: 0.4861\u00d710^-6 m \u2248 4.861\u00d710^-7 m.\n\nSo E \u2248 1.9878\u00d710^-25 / 4.861\u00d710^-7 \u2248 (1.9878/4.861) \u00d7 10^-18 \u2248 approximately 0.409 \u00d7 10^-18 \u2248 4.09\u00d710^-19 J.\n\nSo \u0394E \u2248 4.09\u00d710^-19 J.\n\nNow, comparing \u27e8H_para\u27e9 \u2248 9.27\u00d710^-24 J (for m=1) with \u0394E \u2248 4.09\u00d710^-19 J.\n\nSo \u27e8H_para\u27e9 is about 9.27\u00d710^-24 / 4.09\u00d710^-19 \u2248 (9.27/4.09) \u00d7 10^-5 \u2248 2.27\u00d710^-5. So \u27e8H_para\u27e9 is approximately 2.27\u00d710^-5 times \u0394E. Therefore, \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E. So the answer should be option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, the paramagnetic term:\n\nH_para = (eB\u0127/(2m_e)) * m.\n\nCompute eB\u0127/(2m_e):\n\ne = 1.6\u00d710^-19 C\n\nB = 1 T\n\n\u0127 = 1.05\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s\n\nm_e = 9.11\u00d710^-31 kg\n\nSo:\n\n(1.6\u00d710^-19 C)(1 T)(1.05\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s)/(2 * 9.11\u00d710^-31 kg)\n\nMultiply numerator: 1.6*1.05 = 1.68, exponents: 10^-19 *10^-34 = 10^-53\n\nSo numerator: 1.68\u00d710^-53 C\u00b7T\u00b7J\u00b7s\n\nWait, units: C\u00b7T\u00b7J\u00b7s? Let me check:\n\nWait, e is in C, B in T, \u0127 in J\u00b7s. So e*B*\u0127 has units C*T*J*s.\n\nBut T is kg/(s\u00b2\u00b7A), and A is C/s, so T is kg/(s\u00b2*(C/s)) ) = kg/(s*C). So substituting:\n\nC * (kg/(s*C)) * J*s = kg/(s) * J*s = kg*J. But J is kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2, so kg*(kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2) = kg\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Anyway, perhaps better to just compute numerically.\n\nBut proceeding with numbers:\n\nDenominator: 2*9.11\u00d710^-31 kg = 1.822\u00d710^-30 kg\n\nSo overall: 1.68\u00d710^-53 / 1.822\u00d710^-30 \u2248 1.68/1.822 \u00d7 10^-23 \u2248 0.922\u00d710^-23 \u2248 9.22\u00d710^-24 J per m. So yes, same as before.\n\nThen \u0394E is hc/\u03bb. Let's compute hc:\n\nh = 6.626\u00d710^-34 J\u00b7s\n\nc = 3\u00d710^8 m/s\n\nhc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J\u00b7m\n\n\u03bb = 0.4861 \u03bcm = 0.4861e-6 m\n\nSo E = 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 \u2248 1.9878 / 0.4861 * 1e-19 \u2248 4.09e-19 J. Correct.\n\nSo ratio: 9.22e-24 / 4.09e-19 \u2248 2.25e-5. So \u27e8H\u27e9 is about 2e-5 times \u0394E, which is much smaller. Therefore, \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E. So answer B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I used the correct formula for the paramagnetic term. The paramagnetic term is indeed the Zeeman term, which is proportional to L\u00b7B. For hydrogen atom, the energy levels are split due to this term. However, in the case of weak magnetic fields (which 1T is considered weak in atomic physics terms?), the Zeeman effect is considered as a perturbation. The transition energy \u0394E here is the energy difference between two states without the magnetic field, corresponding to a photon emitted/absorbed with wavelength 0.4861 \u03bcm. \n\nWait, 0.4861 \u03bcm is in the visible range, right? 486 nm is blue light, which corresponds to the H-beta line in the Balmer series, which is transition from n=4 to n=2. Let me confirm: the Balmer series has transitions to n=2. The wavelengths are 656 nm (red, H-alpha, n=3\u21922), 486 nm (blue, H-beta, n=4\u21922), 434 nm (n=5\u21922), etc. So yes, 486.1 nm is H-beta, which is a transition in the visible range.\n\nThe energy of this photon is about 4.09e-19 J, which is about 2.55 eV (since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, so 4.09e-19 /1.6e-19 \u2248 2.56 eV). That makes sense for a visible photon.\n\nOn the other hand, the paramagnetic term \u27e8H_para\u27e9 is about 9.27e-24 J, which is 9.27e-24 /1.6e-19 \u2248 5.79e-5 eV \u2248 58 \u03bceV. So the paramagnetic energy is on the order of microelectronvolts, while the transition energy is a couple of electronvolts. So indeed, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. Therefore, the correct answer is B: \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, sometimes the Bohr magneton is used, which is \u03bc_B = e\u0127/(2m_e). The value of \u03bc_B is approximately 9.27\u00d710^-24 J/T. So the energy is \u03bc_B * B * m. Since B=1 T and m=1, that gives 9.27\u00d710^-24 J, which matches our previous calculation. So that's correct. Therefore, the paramagnetic term is indeed on the order of 1e-23 J, which is way smaller than the transition energy of 1e-18 J (wait, earlier calculation was 4.09e-19 J). Wait, 4.09e-19 J is 4.09e-19 J, and paramagnetic is 9.27e-24 J. So ratio is ~4e-5. So yes, four orders of magnitude smaller. So definitely \u27e8H\u27e9 \u226a \u0394E. Answer B."
