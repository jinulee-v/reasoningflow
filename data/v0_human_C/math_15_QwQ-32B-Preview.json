        "response": "Let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have a right circular cone and a sphere, and some relationships between their volumes and dimensions. The problem states that the base of the cone has the same radius as the given sphere, and that the volume of the cone is one-half that of the sphere. We need to find the ratio of the altitude (height) of the cone to the radius of its base.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formulas for the volume of a cone and the volume of a sphere.\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a cone is given by:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the base and \\( h \\) is the height of the cone.\n\nThe volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is given by:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\nAccording to the problem, the radius of the base of the cone is equal to the radius of the sphere. So, we can denote both radii as \\( r \\).\n\nAdditionally, the volume of the cone is one-half that of the sphere:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{cone}} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\text{sphere}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the formulas, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\right) \\]\n\nLet's simplify this equation to solve for \\( h \\) in terms of \\( r \\).\n\nFirst, simplify the right-hand side:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\right) = \\frac{4}{6} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nSo now we have:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nWe can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominators:\n\n\\[ \\pi r^2 h = 2 \\pi r^3 \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by \\( \\pi \\):\n\n\\[ r^2 h = 2 r^3 \\]\n\nThen, divide both sides by \\( r^2 \\) (assuming \\( r \\neq 0 \\)):\n\n\\[ h = 2 r \\]\n\nSo, the height \\( h \\) of the cone is twice the radius \\( r \\) of its base.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the altitude of the cone to the radius of its base, which is \\( \\frac{h}{r} \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( h = 2 r \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{h}{r} = \\frac{2 r}{r} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 2 to 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n\\[ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{1}\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{2}{3}\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{2}{1}\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{4}} \\]\n\nThe correct choice is \\( \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{2}{1} \\).\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check this because the answer seems straightforward, and sometimes these problems have tricks or additional considerations.\n\nIs there any possibility that the cone and the sphere have other relationships that might affect this ratio? For example, is there any constraint on the dimensions beyond what's been used here?\n\nThe problem specifies that the base of the cone has the same radius as the sphere and that the volume of the cone is half that of the sphere. We've used these two pieces of information to find the ratio of height to radius for the cone.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor to consider. The calculation seems straightforward, and the ratio \\( \\frac{h}{r} = 2 \\) makes sense given that the volume of the cone is half that of the sphere, and the formulas for their volumes are directly related through the dimensions provided.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is \\( \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{2}{1} \\)."
