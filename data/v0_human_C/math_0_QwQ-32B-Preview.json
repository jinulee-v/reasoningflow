        "question": "Show that if each of the equations \\( x^{2} - a = p y \\) and \\( x^{2} - b = p y \\) has a solution in integers, then the equation \\( x^{2} - ab = p y \\) also has a solution in integers. (Where \\( p \\) is a prime number, and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are integers not divisible by \\( p \\)).",
        "response": "So I've got this problem here. It says that if each of the equations \\(x^{2} - a = p y\\) and \\(x^{2} - b = p y\\) has a solution in integers, then the equation \\(x^{2} - ab = p y\\) also has a solution in integers. Here, \\(p\\) is a prime number, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers not divisible by \\(p\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for these equations to have solutions in integers. So, for the first equation, \\(x^{2} - a = p y\\), having a solution means there exist integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that when you plug them into the equation, it holds true. Same for the second equation, \\(x^{2} - b = p y\\). And the goal is to show that based on these two having solutions, the third equation, \\(x^{2} - ab = p y\\), also has integer solutions.\n\nSince \\(p\\) is a prime and neither \\(a\\) nor \\(b\\) is divisible by \\(p\\), that means \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not multiples of \\(p\\). That's important because it tells me that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have multiplicative inverses modulo \\(p\\), but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet.\n\nLet me consider the first equation: \\(x^{2} - a = p y\\). This can be rewritten as \\(x^{2} \\equiv a \\pmod{p}\\), which means that \\(a\\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\). Similarly, the second equation \\(x^{2} - b = p y\\) implies that \\(b\\) is also a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\).\n\nNow, I need to show that \\(ab\\) is also a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\), meaning there exists an integer \\(x\\) such that \\(x^{2} \\equiv ab \\pmod{p}\\).\n\nI recall that the product of two quadratic residues modulo a prime is also a quadratic residue. Is that always true? Let me think about that.\n\nFrom number theory, I know that for a prime \\(p\\), the quadratic residues modulo \\(p\\) form a subset of the nonzero residues modulo \\(p\\), and there are \\(\\frac{p-1}{2}\\) quadratic residues and the same number of non-residues.\n\nThere's a multiplicative property of quadratic residues: if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both quadratic residues modulo \\(p\\), then \\(ab\\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\). Similarly, if one is a residue and the other is a non-residue, then \\(ab\\) is a non-residue, and if both are non-residues, then \\(ab\\) is a residue.\n\nGiven that, since both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are quadratic residues modulo \\(p\\), their product \\(ab\\) should also be a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\). That means there exists some integer \\(x\\) such that \\(x^{2} \\equiv ab \\pmod{p}\\).\n\nSo, if \\(x^{2} \\equiv ab \\pmod{p}\\), then \\(x^{2} - ab = p y\\) for some integer \\(y\\), which is exactly the third equation.\n\nTherefore, if the first two equations have integer solutions, implying that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are quadratic residues modulo \\(p\\),  then \\(ab\\) is also a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\), and thus the third equation has integer solutions.\n\nWait a minute, is that sufficient? The problem is about integer solutions for the equations, not just solutions modulo \\(p\\). I need to make sure that there are actual integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) satisfying \\(x^{2} - ab = p y\\).\n\nGiven that \\(x^{2} \\equiv ab \\pmod{p}\\), I can find an \\(x\\) such that this congruence holds. Then, setting \\(y = \\frac{x^{2} - ab}{p}\\), I need to ensure that \\(y\\) is an integer. Since \\(x^{2} - ab\\) is divisible by \\(p\\) (because of the congruence), \\(y\\) will indeed be an integer.\n\nTherefore, the existence of such an \\(x\\) guarantees that \\(y\\) is an integer, and thus the equation \\(x^{2} - ab = p y\\) has integer solutions.\n\nI think that's the essence of the proof. However, I should double-check if there are any edge cases or additional considerations I might have missed.\n\nFor example, what if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are negative? Or if \\(p\\) is 2? But since \\(p\\) is a prime and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not divisible by \\(p\\), I think the general argument holds.\n\nAlso, I assumed that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are quadratic residues modulo \\(p\\), then \\(ab\\) is also a quadratic residue. Is there a theorem that supports this? Yes, it's a standard result in number theory related to the multiplicative properties of the Legendre symbol.\n\nThe Legendre symbol \\(\\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right)\\) is defined as 1 if \\(a\\) is a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\) and not divisible by \\(p\\), and -1 otherwise. And there's a property that \\(\\left( \\frac{a}{p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{b}{p} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{ab}{p} \\right)\\).\n\nGiven that both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are residues, their Legendre symbols are both 1, so the product is 1, meaning \\(ab\\) is also a residue.\n\nTherefore, the argument is solid.\n\nIn conclusion, if the equations \\(x^{2} - a = p y\\) and \\(x^{2} - b = p y\\) have integer solutions, then \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are quadratic residues modulo \\(p\\), implying that \\(ab\\) is also a quadratic residue modulo \\(p\\). Hence, the equation \\(x^{2} - ab = p y\\) has integer solutions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{If the equations } x^{2} - a = p y \\text{ and } x^{2} - b = p y \\text{ have integer solutions, then } x^{2} - ab = p y \\text{ also has integer solutions.}}\\]"
