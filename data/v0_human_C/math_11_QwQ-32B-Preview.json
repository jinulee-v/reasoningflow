        "question": "Find all positive values of $c$ so that the inequality $x^2-6x+c<0$ has real solutions for $x$. Express your answer in interval notation.",
        "response": "So I have this problem: I need to find all positive values of \\( c \\) such that the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) has real solutions for \\( x \\). And I need to express the answer in interval notation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the inequality to have real solutions for \\( x \\). For a quadratic inequality like this, the graph is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive). The inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) represents the values of \\( x \\) where the parabola is below the x-axis.\n\nFor the quadratic to be negative for some real \\( x \\), the parabola must cross the x-axis at two distinct points. That means the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \\) must have two distinct real roots.\n\nTo have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive. The discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\).\n\nSo, for our equation \\( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \\), the coefficients are:\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( b = -6 \\)\n\n- \\( c = c \\) (the constant term)\n\nThe discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\nD = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c\n\n\\]\n\nFor two distinct real roots, we need \\( D > 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\n36 - 4c > 0\n\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\n\n36 > 4c \\\\\n\n9 > c \\\\\n\nc < 9\n\n\\]\n\nBut the problem asks for positive values of \\( c \\), so \\( c > 0 \\). Therefore, combining these inequalities:\n\n\\[\n\n0 < c < 9\n\n\\]\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the quadratic is indeed negative between the roots. Since the parabola opens upwards, it will be negative between its roots if it has two distinct real roots.\n\nLet me verify this. If \\( c < 9 \\) and \\( c > 0 \\), then the quadratic has two distinct real roots, and the parabola crosses the x-axis at two points. Between these points, the parabola is below the x-axis, meaning \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) for \\( x \\) in that interval.\n\nSo, the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) has real solutions for \\( x \\) precisely when \\( 0 < c < 9 \\).\n\nLet me consider the boundary cases. If \\( c = 9 \\), then \\( D = 0 \\), meaning one real root, and the parabola just touches the x-axis. In this case, the quadratic is never negative, because it only equals zero at that one point and is positive elsewhere.\n\nIf \\( c \\geq 9 \\), then \\( D \\leq 0 \\), meaning no real roots or one real root, and the quadratic is always non-negative. So, there are no real solutions to the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) in this case.\n\nIf \\( c \\leq 0 \\), then \\( D = 36 - 4c \\), which is greater than 36 (since \\( -4c \\) is non-negative), so \\( D > 0 \\), meaning two distinct real roots. However, the problem specifies positive values of \\( c \\), so \\( c \\leq 0 \\) is not considered.\n\nWait a second, the problem asks for positive values of \\( c \\), so \\( c > 0 \\). Therefore, the valid range is \\( 0 < c < 9 \\).\n\nLet me check with specific values to confirm.\n\nTake \\( c = 4 \\), which is between 0 and 9.\n\nThe quadratic becomes \\( x^2 - 6x + 4 < 0 \\).\n\nThe discriminant is \\( 36 - 16 = 20 \\), which is positive, so two distinct real roots.\n\nThe roots are at \\( x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nSo, the quadratic is negative between \\( 3 - \\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( 3 + \\sqrt{5} \\), which are real numbers.\n\nNow, take \\( c = 9 \\).\n\nThe quadratic is \\( x^2 - 6x + 9 < 0 \\), which factors to \\( (x - 3)^2 < 0 \\).\n\nThe only root is \\( x = 3 \\), and the expression is zero at \\( x = 3 \\) and positive elsewhere. So, there are no real solutions to the inequality.\n\nTake \\( c = 10 \\), which is greater than 9.\n\nThe discriminant is \\( 36 - 40 = -4 \\), which is negative, so no real roots. The quadratic is always positive, so no real solutions to the inequality.\n\nNow, take \\( c = 0 \\), although it's not positive.\n\nThe quadratic is \\( x^2 - 6x < 0 \\), which factors to \\( x(x - 6) < 0 \\).\n\nThis is negative between \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 6 \\). So, it does have real solutions, but since \\( c \\) must be positive, we exclude \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the positive values of \\( c \\) that satisfy the condition are \\( 0 < c < 9 \\).\n\nIn interval notation, this is expressed as \\( (0, 9) \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(0,9)} \\]"
