        "question": "Ten points are marked on a circle. How many distinct convex polygons of three or more sides can be drawn using some (or all) of the ten points as vertices?",
        "response": "So I've got this problem here: there are ten points marked on a circle, and I need to figure out how many distinct convex polygons with three or more sides can be drawn using some or all of these points as vertices. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that any set of points on a circle will form a convex polygon because all points are on the circumference, so there are no indentations or anything like that. So, I don't have to worry about non-convex polygons in this case.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for polygons with three or more sides. That means triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, and so on, up to decagons, since there are ten points.\n\nI think the key here is to realize that each subset of these ten points corresponds to a unique convex polygon, as long as the subset has at least three points. So, I need to find the number of subsets of ten points that have three or more points.\n\nTo find the total number of subsets of ten points, it's 2^10, which is 1024. But this includes subsets with fewer than three points, which I need to exclude.\n\nSo, I should subtract the number of subsets with zero points, one point, and two points from the total number of subsets.\n\nThe number of subsets with zero points is 1 (the empty set).\n\nThe number of subsets with one point is C(10,1) = 10.\n\nThe number of subsets with two points is C(10,2) = 45.\n\nSo, the number of subsets with three or more points is 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = 968.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that the number of subsets with exactly k elements from n points is given by the binomial coefficient C(n,k), and the sum of all subsets is 2^n.\n\nSo, to find the number of subsets with at least three elements, it's indeed 2^10 - C(10,0) - C(10,1) - C(10,2).\n\nLet me double-check the binomial coefficients:\n\nC(10,0) = 1\n\nC(10,1) = 10\n\nC(10,2) = 45\n\nSo, 1024 - 1 - 10 - 45 = 968.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the sum of C(10,k) for k from 3 to 10.\n\nSo, C(10,3) + C(10,4) + ... + C(10,10).\n\nI know that C(10,3) = 120\n\nC(10,4) = 210\n\nC(10,5) = 252\n\nC(10,6) = 210\n\nC(10,7) = 120\n\nC(10,8) = 45\n\nC(10,9) = 10\n\nC(10,10) = 1\n\nAdding those up: 120 + 210 = 330, plus 252 is 582, plus 210 is 792, plus 120 is 912, plus 45 is 957, plus 10 is 967, plus 1 is 968.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, there are 968 distinct convex polygons that can be formed using three or more of the ten points as vertices.\n\nBut wait, is there any other way to think about this to confirm?\n\nAnother approach could be to consider that since all points are on a circle, any subset of three or more points will form a convex polygon. So, again, it's just about counting the subsets with at least three points.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that for polygons with three sides (triangles), there are C(10,3) = 120.\n\nFor four sides (quadrilaterals), C(10,4) = 210.\n\nAnd so on, up to C(10,10) = 1.\n\nAdding them up as before gives the same total of 968.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll consider if there's any overlap or if I'm missing something.\n\nEach polygon is unique because each subset of points corresponds to a unique polygon. Since the points are on a circle, no three points are collinear, so every subset of three or more points forms a polygon.\n\nTherefore, no need to worry about degenerate cases.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 968 distinct convex polygons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{968} \\]"
