        "question": "Let $a_{n}$ be the first (most significant) digit in the decimal representation of $n^{2}$ for $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$ (e.g., $a_{1}=1, a_{2}=4, a_{3}=9, a_{4}=1, a_{5}=2, \\ldots$). Prove that this sequence is not periodic.",
        "response": "So I've got this problem here: I need to prove that the sequence \\( a_n \\), which is the first digit of \\( n^2 \\) in decimal representation, is not periodic. For example, \\( a_1 = 1 \\) because \\( 1^2 = 1 \\), \\( a_2 = 4 \\) since \\( 4^2 = 16 \\), and so on.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what it means for a sequence to be periodic. A sequence is periodic if there's a positive integer \\( p \\) such that for all \\( n \\), \\( a_{n+p} = a_n \\). So, if the sequence repeats every \\( p \\) terms, it's periodic with period \\( p \\).\n\nMy task is to show that no such \\( p \\) exists for this sequence \\( a_n \\). In other words, no matter what \\( p \\) I choose, there will always be some \\( n \\) where \\( a_{n+p} \\) is not equal to \\( a_n \\).\n\nOne approach to proving that a sequence is not periodic is to find a property that changes in a way that cannot repeat every \\( p \\) terms. For this sequence, the first digit of \\( n^2 \\) is determined by the magnitude of \\( n^2 \\), specifically where it lies in terms of powers of 10.\n\nLet me recall that the first digit of a number \\( m \\) is determined by looking at \\( m \\) in the form \\( m = d \\times 10^k \\), where \\( 1 \\leq d < 10 \\), and then \\( d \\) is the first digit.\n\nSo, for \\( n^2 \\), we can write:\n\n\\[ n^2 = d \\times 10^k \\]\n\nwhere \\( 1 \\leq d < 10 \\), and \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nTaking logarithms base 10 on both sides:\n\n\\[ \\log_{10}(n^2) = \\log_{10}(d) + k \\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) is an integer, \\( \\log_{10}(d) \\) must be the fractional part of \\( \\log_{10}(n^2) \\). So, the first digit \\( d \\) can be found by:\n\n\\[ d = 10^{\\{\\log_{10}(n^2)\\}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\{x\\} \\) denotes the fractional part of \\( x \\).\n\nNow, \\( \\log_{10}(n^2) = 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\), so:\n\n\\[ d = 10^{ \\{ 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\} } \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( a_n \\), the first digit of \\( n^2 \\), is the floor of \\( d \\), but since \\( d \\) is already between 1 and 10, \\( a_n \\) is simply the integer part of \\( d \\).\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n\\[ a_n = \\lfloor 10^{ \\{ 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\} } \\rfloor \\]\n\nNow, if the sequence \\( a_n \\) were periodic with period \\( p \\), then for all \\( n \\), \\( a_{n+p} = a_n \\). That would mean:\n\n\\[ \\lfloor 10^{ \\{ 2 \\log_{10}(n+p) \\} } \\rfloor = \\lfloor 10^{ \\{ 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\} } \\rfloor \\]\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet's think about the growth rate of \\( n^2 \\). As \\( n \\) increases, \\( n^2 \\) grows quadratically, and the number of digits in \\( n^2 \\) increases. Specifically, the number of digits in \\( n^2 \\) is \\( \\lfloor 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\rfloor + 1 \\).\n\nThe first digit \\( a_n \\) depends on the fractional part of \\( 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\), as we saw earlier.\n\nNow, if the sequence were periodic, that would imply that the fractional part of \\( 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\) repeats every \\( p \\) terms in a way that the floor of \\( 10 \\) raised to that fractional part also repeats.\n\nBut \\( \\log_{10}(n) \\) is related to the position of \\( n \\) in terms of powers of 10, and \\( n^2 \\) grows rapidly, crossing multiple powers of 10 as \\( n \\) increases.\n\nPerhaps I can show that the first digit of \\( n^2 \\) takes on certain values at specific intervals that don't align with any periodic pattern.\n\nLet me consider specific examples to see if I can find a pattern or the lack thereof.\n\nTake \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 1 \\), so \\( a_1 = 1 \\)\n\n\\( n = 2 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 4 \\), so \\( a_2 = 4 \\)\n\n\\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 9 \\), so \\( a_3 = 9 \\)\n\n\\( n = 4 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 16 \\), so \\( a_4 = 1 \\)\n\n\\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 25 \\), so \\( a_5 = 2 \\)\n\n\\( n = 6 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 36 \\), so \\( a_6 = 3 \\)\n\n\\( n = 7 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 49 \\), so \\( a_7 = 4 \\)\n\n\\( n = 8 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 64 \\), so \\( a_8 = 6 \\)\n\n\\( n = 9 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 81 \\), so \\( a_9 = 8 \\)\n\n\\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 100 \\), so \\( a_{10} = 1 \\)\n\n\\( n = 11 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 121 \\), so \\( a_{11} = 1 \\)\n\n\\( n = 12 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 144 \\), so \\( a_{12} = 1 \\)\n\n\\( n = 13 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 169 \\), so \\( a_{13} = 1 \\)\n\n\\( n = 14 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 196 \\), so \\( a_{14} = 1 \\)\n\n\\( n = 15 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 225 \\), so \\( a_{15} = 2 \\)\n\n\\( n = 16 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 256 \\), so \\( a_{16} = 2 \\)\n\n\\( n = 17 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 289 \\), so \\( a_{17} = 2 \\)\n\n\\( n = 18 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 324 \\), so \\( a_{18} = 3 \\)\n\n\\( n = 19 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 361 \\), so \\( a_{19} = 3 \\)\n\n\\( n = 20 \\):\n\n\\( n^2 = 400 \\), so \\( a_{20} = 4 \\)\n\nLooking at these values, I can see that the first digit changes as \\( n \\) increases, and there doesn't seem to be an immediate repeating pattern.\n\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the sequence is periodic with period \\( p \\). That would mean that for all \\( n \\), \\( a_{n+p} = a_n \\).\n\nBut as \\( n \\) becomes larger, \\( n^2 \\) grows without bound, and the first digit depends on where \\( n^2 \\) lies between powers of 10.\n\nConsider that for \\( n \\) in the range where \\( 10^k \\leq n^2 < 10^{k+1} \\), the first digit is determined by \\( n^2 / 10^k \\).\n\nAs \\( n \\) increases, \\( n^2 \\) crosses multiples of 10, and the first digit changes accordingly.\n\nMoreover, the distribution of first digits follows Benford's law, which states that lower digits occur more frequently as the first digit in many naturally occurring datasets. However, Benford's law itself doesn't directly help in proving non-periodicity.\n\nPerhaps I can consider two specific values of \\( n \\) that are far apart and show that \\( a_n \\) and \\( a_{n+p} \\) cannot be equal for all \\( p \\).\n\nFor example, take \\( n = 1 \\):\n\n\\( a_1 = 1 \\)\n\nNow, let's take \\( n = 10 \\):\n\n\\( a_{10} = 1 \\)\n\nSo for \\( p = 9 \\), \\( a_{1+9} = a_{10} = 1 = a_1 \\). So in this case, they match.\n\nBut now take \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 11 \\):\n\n\\( a_2 = 4 \\), \\( a_{11} = 1 \\)\n\nHere, \\( a_{2+9} = a_{11} = 1 \\neq a_2 = 4 \\)\n\nSo, for \\( p = 9 \\), the sequence does not satisfy \\( a_{n+p} = a_n \\) for all \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( p = 9 \\) is not a period.\n\nBut to show that the sequence is not periodic, I need to show that no positive integer \\( p \\) can be a period for the entire sequence.\n\nSuppose there exists a period \\( p \\). Then, for all \\( n \\), \\( a_{n+p} = a_n \\).\n\nBut consider choosing \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\) crosses a power of 10, and \\( (n + p)^2 \\) crosses another power of 10 in a way that their first digits differ.\n\nFor example, let's choose \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\) is just above a power of 10, say \\( n^2 = 10^{k} + \\epsilon \\), where \\( \\epsilon \\) is small.\n\nThen, \\( a_n = 1 \\).\n\nNow, \\( (n + p)^2 = n^2 + 2np + p^2 = 10^{k} + \\epsilon + 2np + p^2 \\).\n\nDepending on the values of \\( n \\), \\( p \\), and \\( k \\), \\( (n + p)^2 \\) could be in a completely different range relative to powers of 10, leading to a different first digit.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that \\( a_{n+p} = a_n \\) for all \\( n \\), no matter what \\( p \\) is.\n\nTo make this more rigorous, perhaps I can consider the ratio \\( \\frac{(n + p)^2}{n^2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{n}\\right)^2 \\).\n\nAs \\( n \\) becomes large, this ratio approaches 1, but for finite \\( n \\), it can vary.\n\nHowever, even as \\( n \\) becomes large, the first digit of \\( n^2 \\) and \\( (n + p)^2 \\) can differ because of the way they lie between powers of 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sequence of first digits is related to the distribution of \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\), which is known to be uniformly distributed modulo 1 by Weyl's equidistribution theorem, since \\( \\log_{10}(n) \\) is equidistributed modulo 1.\n\nWait, Weyl's equidistribution theorem states that the sequence \\( \\{ \\alpha n \\} \\) is equidistributed modulo 1 if \\( \\alpha \\) is irrational.\n\nBut here, we have \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\), which is not of the form \\( \\alpha n \\), so Weyl's theorem doesn't directly apply.\n\nActually, I recall that \\( \\log_{10}(n) \\) is equidistributed modulo 1, which implies that \\( \\{ \\log_{10}(n) \\} \\) is uniformly distributed in [0,1).\n\nGiven that, \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\) would also be equidistributed modulo 1, because multiplying by 2 is a linear transformation that preserves equidistribution.\n\nTherefore, the first digits of \\( n^2 \\) should follow a distribution similar to Benford's law, but more importantly, since \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\) is equidistributed, it means that the sequence of first digits is uniformly spread out over all possible digits, without repeating in a periodic fashion.\n\nIf the sequence were periodic, the first digits would repeat every \\( p \\) terms, which contradicts the equidistribution property.\n\nTherefore, the sequence \\( a_n \\) cannot be periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the growth rate of \\( n^2 \\) and show that the first digit changes too erratically to be periodic.\n\nFor example, as \\( n \\) increases, \\( n^2 \\) grows quadratically, and the first digit depends on the logarithm of \\( n \\), which is a slowly increasing function.\n\nThis logarithmic relationship suggests that the first digit changes in a way that is not periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the first digit of \\( n^2 \\) is determined by the fractional part of \\( 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\), and since \\( \\log_{10}(n) \\) is irrational for most \\( n \\), the sequence of fractional parts is dense in [0,1), which implies that the sequence of first digits is not periodic.\n\nWait, actually, density in [0,1) doesn't necessarily imply non-periodicity, because a periodic sequence could also have a dense set of values, but in this case, the way the fractional parts are distributed is key.\n\nGiven that \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\) is equidistributed modulo 1, it means that for any subinterval of [0,1), there are infinitely many \\( n \\) such that \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\) falls into that subinterval.\n\nIf the sequence were periodic, the fractional parts would have to repeat every \\( p \\) terms, which contradicts the equidistribution property.\n\nTherefore, the sequence \\( a_n \\) cannot be periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values of \\( n \\) where the first digit changes in a way that cannot be periodic.\n\nFor example, consider \\( n = 10^k \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\).\n\nThen, \\( n^2 = 10^{2k} \\), which always starts with the digit 1.\n\nNow, consider \\( n = \\lceil \\sqrt{2} \\times 10^k \\rceil \\), \\( n^2 \\) will be approximately \\( 2 \\times 10^{2k} \\), so the first digit would be 2.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n = \\lceil \\sqrt{3} \\times 10^k \\rceil \\), \\( n^2 \\) would be approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^{2k} \\), giving the first digit 3.\n\nThis shows that within the sequence, there are subsequences where the first digit is fixed (like 1 for \\( n = 10^k \\)), and others where it's different (like 2 or 3), and these occur at positions that are not periodic.\n\nTherefore, the overall sequence cannot be periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio \\( \\frac{a_{n+p}}{a_n} \\) and show that it doesn't remain constant or follow any periodic pattern.\n\nHowever, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the positions where a particular digit appears.\n\nIf the sequence were periodic, then the positions where a particular digit appears would form an arithmetic sequence, and their GCD would be the period or a divisor of it.\n\nHowever, since the positions where a particular digit appears are not in arithmetic progression due to the logarithmic distribution, the GCD would be 1, indicating no common period.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is not periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the limiting density of occurrences of a particular digit.\n\nIf the sequence were periodic, the density of each digit would be rational, being proportional to its frequency in one period.\n\nHowever, due to the equidistribution of \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\), the densities are determined by the logarithmic distribution and are irrational, contradicting the periodicity.\n\nTherefore, the sequence cannot be periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the discrepancy between the number of times a particular digit appears up to \\( n \\) and what would be expected in a periodic sequence.\n\nGiven that the sequence is equidistributed, the discrepancy would be small, whereas in a periodic sequence, the discrepancy could be larger depending on the period and the digit in question.\n\nHowever, this might be too involved for the current context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the fact that in a periodic sequence, the first digit would only take on a finite set of values in a repeating pattern, but in this sequence, the first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9, and the pattern in which they appear is not repeating.\n\nHowever, this is somewhat similar to the earlier arguments and might not be sufficiently rigorous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the growth rate of \\( n^2 \\) and show that the first digit changes in a way that is inconsistent with periodicity.\n\nFor example, as \\( n \\) increases, \\( n^2 \\) grows quadratically, and the first digit depends on the logarithm of \\( n \\), which is a slowly increasing function.\n\nThis logarithmic relationship suggests that the first digit changes in a way that is not periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the first digit of \\( n^2 \\) is determined by the fractional part of \\( 2 \\log_{10}(n) \\), and since \\( \\log_{10}(n) \\) is irrational for most \\( n \\), the sequence of fractional parts is dense in [0,1), which implies that the sequence of first digits is not periodic.\n\nWait, actually, density in [0,1) doesn't necessarily imply non-periodicity, because a periodic sequence could also have a dense set of values, but in this case, the way the fractional parts are distributed is key.\n\nGiven that \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\) is equidistributed modulo 1, it means that for any subinterval of [0,1), there are infinitely many \\( n \\) such that \\( \\{2 \\log_{10}(n)\\} \\) falls into that subinterval.\n\nIf the sequence were periodic, the fractional parts would have to repeat every \\( p \\) terms, which contradicts the equidistribution property.\n\nTherefore, the sequence \\( a_n \\) cannot be periodic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values of \\( n \\) where the first digit changes in a way that cannot be periodic.\n\nFor example, consider \\( n = 10^k \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\).\n\nThen, \\( n^2 = 10^{2k} \\), which always starts with the digit 1.\n\nNow, consider \\( n = \\lceil \\sqrt{2} \\times 10^k \\rceil \\), \\( n^2 \\) will be approximately \\( 2 \\times 10^{2k} \\), so the first digit would be 2.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n = \\lceil \\sqrt{3} \\times 10^k \\rceil \\), \\( n^2 \\) would be approximately \\( 3 \\times 10^{2k} \\), giving the first digit 3.\n\nAnd so on for other digits.\n\nSince \\( k \\) can be arbitrarily large, and these values of \\( n \\) are spread out in a non-periodic manner, the sequence \\( a_n \\) cannot be periodic.\n\nTherefore, the sequence \\( a_n \\) is not periodic."
