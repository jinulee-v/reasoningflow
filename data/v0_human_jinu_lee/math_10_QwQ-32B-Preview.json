        "question": "What is the intersection point of the line $y = 2x + 5$ and the line perpendicular to it that passes through the point $(5, 5)$?",
        "response": "So I have this problem here: find the intersection point of the line \\(y = 2x + 5\\) and the line perpendicular to it that passes through the point \\((5, 5)\\). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it's asking. There are two lines here: one is given by the equation \\(y = 2x + 5\\), and the other is perpendicular to it and goes through the point \\((5, 5)\\). I need to find where these two lines cross each other.\n\nAlright, so let's recall some things about lines and slopes. I know that the slope of a line is a key thing when dealing with perpendicular lines. If two lines are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. That is, if one line has a slope of \\(m\\), the perpendicular line has a slope of \\(-\\frac{1}{m}\\).\n\nGiven that, the first line has a slope of 2 (since it's in the form \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope). So, the slope of the line perpendicular to it should be \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the equation of this perpendicular line that passes through the point \\((5, 5)\\). To find the equation of a line, I can use the point-slope form, which is \\(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\\), where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is a point on the line and \\(m\\) is the slope.\n\nSo, plugging in the point \\((5, 5)\\) and the slope \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), I get:\n\n\\[y - 5 = -\\frac{1}{2}(x - 5)\\]\n\nLet me simplify that. First, distribute the \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\):\n\n\\[y - 5 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{5}{2}\\]\n\nNow, add 5 to both sides to solve for \\(y\\):\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{5}{2} + 5\\]\n\nWait, let's make sure we add that correctly. \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\) is 2.5, and 5 is 5.0, so together that's 7.5, which is \\(\\frac{15}{2}\\). So, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{15}{2}\\]\n\nOkay, now I have the equations of both lines:\n\n1. \\(y = 2x + 5\\)\n\n2. \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{15}{2}\\)\n\nTo find their intersection point, I need to find the \\((x, y)\\) that satisfies both equations. So, I can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\[2x + 5 = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{15}{2}\\]\n\nHmm, let's solve for \\(x\\). First, maybe I can eliminate the fractions to make it easier. I can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominators:\n\n\\[2 \\times (2x + 5) = 2 \\times \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{15}{2}\\right)\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[4x + 10 = -x + 15\\]\n\nNow, I can add \\(x\\) to both sides:\n\n\\[4x + x + 10 = 15\\]\n\n\\[5x + 10 = 15\\]\n\nThen, subtract 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[5x = 5\\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[x = 1\\]\n\nOkay, so the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the intersection point is 1. Now, I need to find the corresponding \\(y\\)-coordinate. I can plug \\(x = 1\\) back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation \\(y = 2x + 5\\):\n\n\\[y = 2(1) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\\]\n\nSo, the intersection point should be \\((1, 7)\\).\n\nWait a minute, let me verify this. I should get the same \\(y\\)-value if I plug \\(x = 1\\) into the second equation. Let's check:\n\n\\[y = -\\frac{1}{2}(1) + \\frac{15}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7\\]\n\nYes, great, it's consistent. So, the intersection point is indeed \\((1, 7)\\).\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should graph these lines mentally to see if that makes sense. The first line, \\(y = 2x + 5\\), has a slope of 2 and a y-intercept at \\(5\\). The second line, \\(y = -\\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{15}{2}\\), has a slope of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) and a y-intercept at \\(7.5\\). These lines should cross at \\((1, 7)\\).\n\nLet me imagine plotting these. Starting from the y-intercept of the first line at \\((0, 5)\\), with a slope of 2, it goes up 2 units for every 1 unit to the right. So, from \\((0, 5)\\), to \\((1, 7)\\), to \\((2, 9)\\), and so on. The second line starts at \\((0, 7.5)\\), and with a slope of \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), it goes down half a unit for every 1 unit to the right. So, from \\((0, 7.5)\\), to \\((1, 7)\\), to \\((2, 6.5)\\), and so on. Yes, they do intersect at \\((1, 7)\\).\n\nI think that checks out. So, the final answer should be \\((1, 7)\\)."
