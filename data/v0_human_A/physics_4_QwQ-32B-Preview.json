        "question": "\"An object emitting a sound wave is moving towards a stationary observer with a speed of 0.6c. If the frequency of the sound wave emitted by the object is 500 Hz, what is the frequency heard by the observer according to the relativistic wave Doppler effect?\"",
        "response": "Alright, so I've got this problem here about the Doppler effect in relativity. It says that an object is moving towards a stationary observer at 0.6 times the speed of light, which is pretty fast! The frequency of the sound it's emitting is 500 Hz, and I need to find out what frequency the observer hears, taking relativity into account.\n\nFirst, I remember that the classical Doppler effect formula is f' = f (v + vo) / (v - vs), where f is the emitted frequency, v is the speed of sound, vo is the observer's speed, and vs is the source's speed. But this is for non-relativistic speeds, and here the object is moving at 0.6c, which is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so I need to use the relativistic Doppler effect formula.\n\nI think the relativistic Doppler shift formula accounts for time dilation and other relativistic effects. I recall that it involves the Lorentz factor, gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). In this case, v is 0.6c, so I can calculate gamma.\n\nLet me calculate gamma first. v is 0.6c, so v² is (0.6c)² = 0.36c². Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. So, gamma is 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.\n\nNow, for the relativistic Doppler shift, when the source is moving towards a stationary observer, the observed frequency f' is f * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)). Plugging in v = 0.6c, that would be f' = 500 Hz * sqrt((1 + 0.6)/(1 - 0.6)).\n\nLet me calculate the inside of the square root: (1 + 0.6) = 1.6 and (1 - 0.6) = 0.4. So, sqrt(1.6/0.4) = sqrt(4) = 2. Therefore, f' = 500 Hz * 2 = 1000 Hz.\n\nWait, is that correct? I feel like there might be more to it because of relativity. Let me double-check the formula. I think the general relativistic Doppler shift formula is f' = f * sqrt((c + vo)/(c - vs)) for the observer moving towards the source, but in this case, the observer is stationary, and the source is moving towards the observer.\n\nActually, I found another version of the formula: f' = f * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c)). That's what I used earlier. So, plugging in v = 0.6c, it should be correct.\n\nBut I also remember that in relativity, simultaneity and time dilation play a role, so maybe there's an additional factor I'm missing. Let me think about it differently. If the source is moving towards the observer at 0.6c, the wavelength observed should be shorter due to the source moving towards the observer, leading to a higher frequency.\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems reasonable. The frequency doubles from 500 Hz to 1000 Hz. I guess that's the answer."
