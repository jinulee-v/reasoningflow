        "question": "The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}$?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where x varies directly as the square of y, and y varies directly as the cube of z. When z is 2, x is -16, and I need to find x when z is 1/2. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, direct variation. If x varies directly as the square of y, that means x is proportional to y squared. So I can write that as x = k * y\u00b2, where k is some constant of proportionality. Similarly, y varies directly as the cube of z, so y = m * z\u00b3, where m is another constant. Wait, but maybe since both are direct variations, maybe I can combine them into one equation? Let me think.\n\nIf x varies directly as y\u00b2 and y varies directly as z\u00b3, then substituting the expression for y into the equation for x should work. So substituting y = m * z\u00b3 into x = k * y\u00b2 gives x = k * (m * z\u00b3)\u00b2. Simplifying that, x = k * m\u00b2 * z\u2076. But wait, since k and m are both constants, their product would also be a constant. Maybe I can combine them into a single constant? Let's say x = C * z\u2076, where C = k * m\u00b2. That might simplify things.\n\nSo, if x = C * z\u2076, then I can use the given values to find C. When z = 2, x = -16. Plugging those into the equation: -16 = C * (2)\u2076. Let's compute 2\u2076. 2^6 is 64. So, -16 = C * 64. Solving for C, divide both sides by 64: C = -16 / 64 = -1/4. So C is -1/4. Therefore, the equation relating x and z is x = (-1/4) * z\u2076.\n\nNow, the question asks for the value of x when z = 1/2. So plug z = 1/2 into the equation: x = (-1/4) * (1/2)\u2076. Let's compute (1/2)^6. (1/2)^6 is 1/64. So x = (-1/4) * (1/64) = (-1) / (256). So x = -1/256.\n\nWait, let me check that again. (1/2)^6 is 1/64, right? Because (1/2)^2 is 1/4, then cubed is 1/8, but wait, no. Wait, (1/2)^6 is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2). Which is 1/(2^6) = 1/64. So yes, 1/64. Then multiplying by -1/4: (-1/4)*(1/64) = (-1)/(256). So x is -1/256. That seems right.\n\nBut let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, translating the direct variations into equations. x varies directly as y\u00b2: x = k y\u00b2. y varies directly as z\u00b3: y = m z\u00b3. So substituting y into x's equation gives x = k (m z\u00b3)\u00b2 = k m\u00b2 z\u2076. So x = C z\u2076 where C = k m\u00b2. Then using x = -16 when z = 2: -16 = C*(2)^6. 2^6 is 64, so C = -16 / 64 = -1/4. Then when z = 1/2, x = (-1/4)*(1/2)^6 = (-1/4)*(1/64) = -1/256. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it without combining the constants. Let's see. If x varies directly as y\u00b2, then x = k y\u00b2. And y varies directly as z\u00b3, so y = m z\u00b3. Then x = k (m z\u00b3)\u00b2 = k m\u00b2 z\u2076. So same result. So regardless of how I approach it, I end up with x proportional to z\u2076 with proportionality constant -1/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using ratios. Since x varies directly as z\u2076, then the ratio of x1/x2 = (z1/z2)^6. So if x1 = -16 when z1 = 2, and we need x2 when z2 = 1/2. Then x1/x2 = (z1/z2)^6. So (-16)/x2 = (2 / (1/2))^6. Let's compute 2 divided by 1/2, which is 4. So (4)^6 = 4096. Therefore, (-16)/x2 = 4096. Solving for x2: x2 = (-16)/4096 = (-1)/256. Same answer. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the value of x when z is 1/2 is -1/256.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) when \\( z \\) equals \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{256}}\\)."
