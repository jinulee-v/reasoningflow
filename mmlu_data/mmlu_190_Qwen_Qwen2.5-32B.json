        "question": "What are the two main dimensions of the Ohio Studies into leadership?",
        "response": "The Ohio Studies identified two main dimensions of leadership: initiating structure and consideration. Initiating structure refers to the extent to which a leader is likely to define and structure his or her role and those of group members in the search for goal attainment. Consideration refers to the extent to which a leader is likely to have job relationships characterized by mutual trust, respect for group members' ideas and feelings, and the acceptance of group members for who they are."
