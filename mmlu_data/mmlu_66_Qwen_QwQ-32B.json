        "question": "Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance\n\nyt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut\n\nThe (unconditional) mean of y will be given by",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the unconditional mean of this AR(1) model. The model given is yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut, where the disturbances ut have zero mean and unit variance. Hmm, let me recall what an AR(1) model is. It's an autoregressive model of order 1, meaning that the current value of the time series depends linearly on the previous value plus some error term. \n\nThe question is asking for the unconditional mean, which I think is the long-run average value of the series, not conditional on any particular starting point. Right, so the unconditional mean is the expected value of yt as t approaches infinity, assuming the process is stationary. \n\nFirst, I should check if the process is stationary. For an AR(1) model, stationarity requires that the absolute value of the coefficient on yt-1 is less than 1. In this case, the coefficient is 0.4, which is between -1 and 1, so the process is indeed stationary. That means the unconditional mean exists and is constant over time.\n\nNow, how do I calculate the unconditional mean? I remember that for a stationary AR(1) process, the unconditional mean \u03bc can be found by taking expectations of both sides of the equation. Let me write that out:\n\nE[yt] = E[0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut]\n\nSince expectation is linear, this becomes:\n\nE[yt] = 0.2 + 0.4 E[yt-1] + E[ut]\n\nBut the disturbances ut have a mean of zero, so E[ut] = 0. Also, because the process is stationary, the expectation of yt is the same as the expectation of yt-1. Let's denote the unconditional mean as \u03bc. Then:\n\n\u03bc = 0.2 + 0.4 \u03bc + 0\n\nNow, solving for \u03bc:\n\n\u03bc - 0.4 \u03bc = 0.2  \n0.6 \u03bc = 0.2  \n\u03bc = 0.2 / 0.6  \n\u03bc = 1/3 \u2248 0.333...\n\nWait, let me verify that again. Starting from the equation:\n\n\u03bc = 0.2 + 0.4 \u03bc\n\nSubtract 0.4 \u03bc from both sides:\n\n\u03bc - 0.4 \u03bc = 0.2  \n0.6 \u03bc = 0.2  \nThen \u03bc = 0.2 divided by 0.6. \n\n0.2 divided by 0.6 is the same as 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3. So yes, 1/3 or approximately 0.3333. That seems right. \n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the formula for the unconditional mean of an AR(1) process. The general form of an AR(1) is yt = c + \u03c6 yt-1 + ut. The unconditional mean \u03bc is then c / (1 - \u03c6), provided that |\u03c6| < 1. \n\nIn this case, c is 0.2 and \u03c6 is 0.4. Plugging into the formula:\n\n\u03bc = 0.2 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.2 / 0.6 = 1/3. Yep, same result. \n\nSo that confirms it. The unconditional mean is 1/3. \n\nI should also make sure I didn't confuse unconditional with conditional mean. The conditional mean given yt-1 would just be 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1, but the question specifically asks for the unconditional mean, which is the long-term average. Since the process is stationary, this is just the constant term divided by (1 minus the autoregressive coefficient). \n\nAnother check: if the coefficient were 1, it would be a random walk, and the unconditional mean would just be the constant divided by (1 - 1), which is undefined, which makes sense because a random walk isn't stationary. But here, since the coefficient is less than 1, it's stationary and the mean is well-defined. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of simulating the process. Suppose we start with some initial value y0, then each subsequent term is 0.2 + 0.4 times the previous term plus some noise. Over time, the effect of the initial condition dies out because of the 0.4 coefficient (which is less than 1 in absolute value), so the process converges to the mean. The noise terms average out to zero in the long run, so the deterministic part should drive it to the mean. \n\nIf I consider the process without the error term (setting ut=0 for all t), then the equation becomes yt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1. Starting from some y0, the solution would be a geometric series. The steady state would be when yt = yt-1 = \u03bc, so \u03bc = 0.2 + 0.4 \u03bc, leading again to \u03bc = 0.2 / 0.6 = 1/3. Adding back the error term, since they have mean zero, the unconditional mean remains the same. \n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the unconditional mean is 1/3. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe unconditional mean of \\( y \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the unconditional mean of the given AR(1) model \\( y_t = 0.2 + 0.4 y_{t-1} + u_t \\), we start by noting that the process is stationary because the absolute value of the autoregressive coefficient (0.4) is less than 1. \n\nFor a stationary AR(1) process, the unconditional mean \\( \\mu \\) can be found by taking the expectation of both sides of the equation. Let \\( \\mu = E[y_t] \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nE[y_t] = E[0.2 + 0.4 y_{t-1} + u_t]\n\\]\n\nSince \\( E[u_t] = 0 \\) and the expectation of \\( y_t \\) is the same as the expectation of \\( y_{t-1} \\) due to stationarity, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\mu = 0.2 + 0.4 \\mu + 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\mu \\):\n\n\\[\n\\mu - 0.4 \\mu = 0.2 \\\\\n0.6 \\mu = 0.2 \\\\\n\\mu = \\frac{0.2}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the unconditional mean of \\( y \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}."

Let \\( \\mu = E[y_t] \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nE[y_t] = E[0.2 + 0.4 y_{t-1} + u_t]\n\\]\n\nSince \\( E[u_t] = 0 \\) and the expectation of \\( y_t \\) is the same as the expectation of \\( y_{t-1} \\) due to stationarity, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\mu = 0.2 + 0.4 \\mu + 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( \\mu \\):\n\n\\[\n\\mu - 0.4 \\mu = 0.2 \\\\\n0.6 \\mu = 0.2 \\\\\n\\mu = \\frac{0.2}{0.6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the unconditional mean of \\( y \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.",
