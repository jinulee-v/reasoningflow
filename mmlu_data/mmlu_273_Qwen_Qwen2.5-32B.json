        "question": "How do Defensive Realism and Offensive Realism differ in their explanation of state behaviour?",
        "response": "Defensive Realism and Offensive Realism are two different approaches to understanding state behavior in the context of international relations. Defensive Realism emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance of power and avoiding unnecessary conflicts, while Offensive Realism focuses on the pursuit of power and the desire to dominate other states. Defensive Realism argues that states should prioritize their own security and avoid getting involved in conflicts that do not directly threaten their interests, while Offensive Realism suggests that states should be more aggressive in pursuing their interests and be willing to use force if necessary. Defensive Realism is often associated with the idea of a \"security dilemma,\" where states may feel threatened by the actions of other states and respond by increasing their own military capabilities, while Offensive Realism is associated with the idea of a \"power transition,\" where states may seek to challenge the dominant power in the international system in order to gain more influence and control."
