        "question": "A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that",
        "response": "The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that the state statute violates his First Amendment right to free speech. The student's use of the American flag as a symbol of protest and his verbal expression of contempt towards the police officer are both forms of protected speech under the First Amendment. The state statute, by criminalizing the use of obscene or opprobrious language towards a police officer, may be seen as an infringement on the student's right to free speech. The student's actions, while potentially offensive, are still protected under the First Amendment, and the state statute may be seen as an overbroad restriction on free speech."
