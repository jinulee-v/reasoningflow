        "question": "Which of the following is necessarily a characteristic of oligopoly?",
        "response": "In an oligopoly, there are a few sellers and they are interdependent. This means that the actions of one seller can have a significant impact on the other sellers in the market. For example, if one seller lowers their prices, the other sellers may have to lower their prices as well in order to remain competitive. This interdependence can lead to strategic behavior, such as price fixing or collusion, in order to maximize profits. Additionally, in an oligopoly, there may be barriers to entry that make it difficult for new firms to enter the market. These barriers can include economies of scale, patents, or government regulations. Overall, the key characteristics of an oligopoly are a small number of sellers, interdependence, and barriers to entry."
