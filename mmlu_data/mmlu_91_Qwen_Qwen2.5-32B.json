        "question": "A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme\u2019s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity?",
        "response": "The mutation may alter the enzyme's substrate specificity by changing the enzyme's overall structure or stability, which could indirectly affect the active site's ability to bind to the substrate. This could result in a change in the enzyme's affinity for its substrate or a change in the enzyme's ability to catalyze the reaction. However, since the mutation is located at a site distant from the active site, the effect on substrate specificity may be minimal or negligible."
