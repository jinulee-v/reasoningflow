The focus is on the consultee's professional functioning rather than directly intervening with the client or patient. The consultant aims to address the consultee's difficulties, which may stem from a lack of knowledge, skills, confidence, or objectivity, to enhance their effectiveness in their role. This approach emphasizes collaboration, education, and support for the consultee rather than taking over the case or providing direct services."
