        "question": "To ensure the independence of the non-executive board members, they are a number of steps which can be taken, which include non-executives being drawn from _______ the company, being appointed for a _________ time period as well as being appointed _________.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the correct words to fill in the blanks in this sentence about ensuring the independence of non-executive board members. Let me start by breaking down the question.\n\nThe sentence structure is: \"To ensure the independence of the non-executive board members, they are a number of steps which can be taken, which include non-executives being drawn from _______ the company, being appointed for a _________ time period as well as being appointed _________.\"\n\nHmm, the first blank is after \"drawn from\". The phrase \"drawn from\" usually means selecting people from a particular group or background. Since we're talking about non-executives needing independence, they probably shouldn't be from within the company. So maybe the first blank is \"outside\" or \"external\". Let me think... Yes, \"outside\" makes sense here because if they're from outside the company, they are more independent.\n\nThe second blank is about the time period for their appointment. Non-executives often have terms to ensure they don't become too entrenched. The options here might be \"fixed\", \"specific\", \"limited\", or \"long\". Wait, but if it's for independence, maybe a fixed or limited term so they can't stay too long and become part of the inner circle. \"Fixed term\" is a common term used in appointments. Alternatively, \"specific\" could work, but \"fixed\" is more standard. Let me check... Yes, \"fixed\" seems right.\n\nThe third blank is about how they are appointed. The sentence structure here is \"being appointed _________.\" The options might be \"independently\", \"separately\", \"by shareholders\", or \"through a committee\". Since the goal is independence, perhaps they should be appointed independently of the executives. \"Independently\" could fit here. Alternatively, maybe \"by an independent committee\" but the blank is a single word. \"Independently\" might be the best fit here. Another possibility is \"directly\" but that might not emphasize independence. Wait, another thought: sometimes non-executives are appointed through a different process, maybe \"separately\" from executives. Hmm. Alternatively, \"without influence\" but that's two words. Let me think again. The key is ensuring their appointment process is independent. So \"independently\" is probably the right choice here.\n\nPutting it all together: drawn from outside the company, appointed for a fixed time period, and appointed independently. Let me check if that makes sense. Yes, that seems to align with common corporate governance practices. Non-executives are external, have fixed terms to prevent long-term ties, and their appointment process is independent to avoid conflicts of interest. \n\nWait, another angle: sometimes the third blank could be \"by shareholders\" but that's a phrase. The sentence structure uses \"appointed _________\", so a single adjective. Alternatively, \"openly\" or \"transparently\"? But those might not directly relate to independence. \"Independently\" still seems best. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"collectively\" but that doesn't add to independence. Hmm. Let me confirm. The third part is about the method of appointment. To ensure independence, the appointment shouldn't be controlled by the executives or management. So \"independently\" would mean the appointment process is independent, perhaps by a board committee without executive influence. That makes sense. \n\nSo the answers are: outside, fixed, independently. Let me see if there's any other possible terms. Maybe \"external\" instead of \"outside\"? Both are correct. \"Fixed\" vs \"limited\"? \"Fixed\" is more precise. \"Independently\" is the best for the third. \n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure the sentence flows: \"non-executives being drawn from outside the company, being appointed for a fixed time period as well as being appointed independently.\" Yes, that sounds correct.\n</think>\n\nTo ensure the independence of the non-executive board members, there are a number of steps which can be taken, which include non-executives being drawn from **outside** the company, being appointed for a **fixed** time period as well as being appointed **independently**.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Outside the company**: Non-executives should come from external sources to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure objectivity.\n2. **Fixed time period**: A defined term (e.g., 3\u20135 years) prevents long-term entrenchment and ensures regular renewal of perspectives.\n3. **Independently**: The appointment process should be free from influence by executives or management, often handled by an independent committee or shareholders to maintain impartiality."
