        "question": "Which of the following is a morphological characteristic of the paramyxoviruses.",
        "response": "Paramyxoviruses are a family of viruses that include several important human pathogens, such as measles virus, mumps virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). One of the key morphological characteristics of paramyxoviruses is their bullet-shaped or pleomorphic (irregularly shaped) virions. These viruses have a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome and are enveloped, meaning they have a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane. The envelope contains two major glycoproteins: the fusion (F) protein, which mediates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, and the attachment (H) protein, which binds to specific receptors on the host cell surface. The presence of these glycoproteins on the surface of the virion is another important morphological feature of paramyxoviruses."
