        "question": "Beyond the business case for engaging in CSR there are a number of moral arguments relating to: negative _______, the _______that corporations possess and the ________ of business and society.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the three words that fit into the blanks here. The sentence is about CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) and the moral arguments related to negative something, the something that corporations have, and the something between business and society. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first blank is \"negative _________\". Common terms related to CSR and morality that start with \"negative\" might be \"externalities\". Negative externalities are costs imposed on third parties, like pollution. That makes sense because corporations often face criticism for negative externalities they create.\n\nSecond blank: \"the _______ that corporations possess\". Here, I'm thinking of something corporations have that relates to moral responsibility. Maybe \"power\" or \"responsibility\"? But \"power\" is more about capability. Alternatively, \"stakeholder interests\"? Wait, but the structure is \"possess\", so maybe \"power\" or \"privilege\"? Or perhaps \"resources\"? Hmm. Another angle: corporations have \"rights\", but that might not fit. Wait, maybe \"privilege\" as in the privilege to operate, so they have a responsibility. Alternatively, \"capacity\" or \"ability\". Wait, the term \"moral agency\" comes to mind. Moral agency refers to the ability to make moral judgments. So maybe \"moral agency\" that corporations possess. That could work because it's a moral argument that corporations, as entities, have the ability to act morally.\n\nThird blank: \"the ________ of business and society\". This is likely a relationship term. Common phrases might be \"interdependence\", \"integration\", \"connection\", \"interconnectedness\", or \"mutual dependence\". \"Interdependence\" is a strong candidate here because it's often discussed in CSR contexts how businesses and society rely on each other. Alternatively, \"synergy\" but that's more about collaboration. \"Interconnectedness\" is also possible, but \"interdependence\" is more about mutual reliance, which is a key moral argument.\n\nLet me check each part again. Negative externalities are a classic CSR issue. Corporations possessing moral agency (the capacity to act morally) is a common argument. The interdependence between business and society is a standard point in CSR discussions. That seems to fit. Let me see if there are other possibilities. For the second blank, maybe \"obligations\"? But the sentence says \"possess\", so obligations are things they have, but \"moral agency\" is more about their capacity. Alternatively, \"resources\" but that's more practical. \"Privilege\" might be another angle, but \"moral agency\" is more directly related to the moral argument. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"influence\" as in the influence corporations have. But \"possess influence\" works, but the moral argument here might be more about their responsibility because of their power. Hmm. Wait, the question is about moral arguments related to negative X, the Y that corporations possess, and the Z of business and society. So the three elements are: negative (something bad they cause), the something they have (like power or agency), and the relationship between business and society. \n\nAnother thought: The second blank could be \"power\" or \"privilege\". If it's \"power\", then the moral argument is that because they have power, they should act responsibly. But \"moral agency\" is more about their capacity to make ethical decisions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"responsibility\" but that's more the outcome. Let me think of standard CSR frameworks. The triple bottom line includes people, planet, profit. The moral arguments often include the idea that businesses have a responsibility beyond profit because of their impact (negative externalities), their role in society (interdependence), and their capacity as moral agents. \n\nWait, another angle: The second blank might refer to \"rights\". Like, corporations have legal rights, so they also have responsibilities. But \"possess rights\" is possible, but the moral argument here might be more about their moral obligations. \n\nAlternatively, \"privilege\" as in the privilege to operate in society, so they have a responsibility. But \"privilege\" is a noun that fits. \n\nHmm. Let me see if I can find a standard phrasing. Maybe looking up common CSR moral arguments. \n\nNegative externalities are definitely a key point. \n\nThe second part: corporations possess \"moral agency\" is a concept in business ethics. For example, the idea that corporations are moral agents and thus have responsibilities. \n\nThird part: the interdependence of business and society. Yes, that's a common term. \n\nSo putting it all together: negative externalities, the moral agency that corporations possess, and the interdependence of business and society. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"stake\" in the third blank? Like the stake that business has in society? But \"interdependence\" sounds better. \n\nAlternatively, \"integration\" but that's less likely. \n\nAnother possibility for the second blank: \"power\". The moral argument could be that because corporations have significant power, they have a responsibility. \n\nBut \"moral agency\" is more about their capacity to act ethically, which is a key point in CSR. \n\nI think the most likely answers are:\n\nnegative externalities, the moral agency that corporations possess, and the interdependence of business and society.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"negative impacts\" instead of externalities? But \"externalities\" is more specific and commonly used in economics and CSR contexts. \n\nAlternatively, \"negative consequences\" but again, externalities is the technical term. \n\nSo I'll go with externalities, moral agency, interdependence.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence can be completed with the following terms, which are key concepts in discussions about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and its moral underpinnings:\n\n**Negative externalities**, the **moral agency** that corporations possess, and the **interdependence** of business and society.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Negative externalities**: This refers to the harmful consequences corporations may impose on society or the environment (e.g., pollution, inequality) that are not accounted for in their profit-driven decisions. Addressing these is a core moral argument for CSR.\n2. **Moral agency**: This highlights the idea that corporations, as entities with decision-making power, have the capacity and responsibility to act ethically. They are not just economic actors but also moral agents accountable to broader societal values.\n3. **Interdependence**: This underscores the mutual reliance between businesses and society. Corporations depend on societal resources (e.g., labor, infrastructure, trust), while society relies on businesses for economic growth and well-being, creating a shared obligation to act responsibly.\n\nThese terms collectively frame CSR as a moral imperative rooted in ethical responsibility, corporate capability, and the symbiotic relationship between business and society."
