        "question": "To achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%), according to Hoeffding's inequality the IID test set must have how many examples?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many examples an IID test set must have to ensure that the 0/1 loss estimate is less than 1% of the true 0/1 loss with 95% probability, using Hoeffding's inequality. Hmm, let me start by recalling what Hoeffding's inequality says. \n\nHoeffding's inequality gives a bound on the probability that the sum of bounded independent random variables deviates from its expected value. In the context of machine learning, this is often used to bound the difference between the empirical error (the error on the test set) and the true error (the actual error rate of the model). \n\nThe 0/1 loss is a loss function that assigns a loss of 1 for incorrect predictions and 0 for correct ones. The true 0/1 loss is the expected value of this loss over the entire distribution of examples, while the empirical 0/1 loss is the average loss over the test set. \n\nHoeffding's inequality in this context would state that for any \u03b4 > 0, the probability that the absolute difference between the empirical loss (L_emp) and the true loss (L_true) is greater than some \u03b5 is bounded by:\n\nP(|L_emp - L_true| \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 2 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2)\n\nHere, n is the number of examples in the test set. The question wants this probability to be less than 5% (since we want 95% confidence), so we can set the right-hand side to 0.05 and solve for n. \n\nBut wait, the problem states that the estimate (L_emp) should be less than 1% of the true loss (L_true). Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse that again. \n\nIt says: \"an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%)\". \n\nWait, does that mean that L_emp < 0.01 * L_true? Or is it that the difference between L_emp and L_true is less than 1% of L_true? The wording is a bit ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's saying that the estimate is within 1% of the true loss. That is, |L_emp - L_true| \u2264 0.01 * L_true. But the problem says \"less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\", so maybe it's an absolute difference? Or a relative difference?\n\nHmm, this is critical. Let me think. \n\nIf it's an absolute difference, then \u03b5 = 0.01 * L_true. But Hoeffding's inequality requires \u03b5 to be a fixed value, not dependent on L_true. That complicates things because L_true is unknown. \n\nAlternatively, if it's a relative difference, then we want |L_emp - L_true| \u2264 0.01 * L_true. But again, L_true is unknown. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased such that the estimate is within 1% of the true loss, so the error bound is 1% of the true loss. But Hoeffding's inequality is usually used to bound the absolute difference, not relative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the estimate to be within 1% of the true loss, so \u03b5 = 0.01 * L_true. But since L_true is unknown, maybe we need to consider the worst case? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler. Maybe it's saying that the estimate is within 1% of the true loss, so the maximum allowable difference is 1% of the true loss. But since Hoeffding's inequality is about the absolute difference, perhaps we need to set \u03b5 = 0.01 * L_true. But since L_true is unknown, perhaps we need to bound it in terms of the worst case? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is actually asking for the estimate to be within 1% of the true loss in absolute terms, so \u03b5 = 0.01. Wait, but 1% of the true loss could be different depending on the true loss. For example, if the true loss is 10%, then 1% of that is 0.1%, but if the true loss is 50%, then 1% is 0.5%. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check the exact wording again: \"To achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%), according to Hoeffding's inequality the IID test set must have how many examples?\"\n\nWait, \"less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\". So L_emp < 0.01 * L_true? That would mean the estimate is much smaller than the true loss, which might not make sense because if the true loss is, say, 10%, then the estimate would have to be less than 0.1%, which is very strict. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and they meant \"within 1% of the true loss\", which would make more sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's an absolute difference of 1%, so |L_emp - L_true| \u2264 0.01. But then the question says \"less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\", so maybe it's |L_emp - L_true| \u2264 0.01 * L_true. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using \"less than 1 percent\" in the sense of the relative error. The relative error is |L_emp - L_true| / L_true < 0.01. \n\nAssuming that's the case, then we can write:\n\nP(|L_emp - L_true| / L_true \u2265 0.01) \u2264 0.05\n\nBut Hoeffding's inequality is about absolute differences, so we need to relate this to an absolute \u03b5. Let me denote \u03b5 = 0.01 * L_true. Then the inequality becomes:\n\nP(|L_emp - L_true| \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 0.05\n\nBut Hoeffding's inequality gives:\n\nP(|L_emp - L_true| \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 2 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2)\n\nSo setting 2 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2) \u2264 0.05, then solving for n. \n\nBut here, \u03b5 is dependent on L_true, which is unknown. So this complicates things because we can't know \u03b5 in advance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is actually asking for the absolute error to be less than 1% of the true loss. Wait, but 1% of the true loss is \u03b5 = 0.01 * L_true. But since L_true is unknown, perhaps we need to bound it in terms of the worst case? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is actually asking for the estimate to be within 1% of the true loss in absolute terms, so \u03b5 = 0.01, regardless of L_true. That would make more sense because then we can apply Hoeffding directly. \n\nWait, let me check the exact wording again: \"less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\". Hmm, that does sound like a relative error. For example, if the true loss is 10%, then 1% of that is 0.1%, so the estimate must be within 0.1% of the true loss. But if the true loss is 50%, then 1% is 0.5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly and they meant \"within 1% of the true loss\", which would be an absolute difference of 1%, so \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using \"less than 1 percent\" as an absolute value. Let me think of possible interpretations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that the estimate is within 1% of the true loss, so the maximum allowable error is 1% of the true loss. But since Hoeffding's inequality is about absolute error, perhaps we can write:\n\nWe want |L_emp - L_true| \u2264 0.01 * L_true with probability 95%. \n\nBut since L_true is unknown, perhaps we can bound this in terms of the worst case. Let me consider that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is actually simpler. Maybe it's saying that the estimate is within 1% of the true loss, so the error bound is 1%, so \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nAssuming that, then we can proceed with Hoeffding's inequality. Let me try that approach first. \n\nSo, if we set \u03b5 = 0.01, then we can plug into Hoeffding's inequality:\n\nP(|L_emp - L_true| \u2265 0.01) \u2264 2 exp(-2n*(0.01)^2)\n\nWe want this probability to be \u2264 0.05 (since 95% confidence). \n\nSo set 2 exp(-2n*(0.0001)) \u2264 0.05\n\nSolving for n:\n\nexp(-2n*(0.0001)) \u2264 0.025\n\nTake natural logarithm on both sides:\n\n-2n*(0.0001) \u2264 ln(0.025)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips):\n\n2n*(0.0001) \u2265 -ln(0.025)\n\nCompute -ln(0.025):\n\nln(0.025) \u2248 ln(1/40) \u2248 -3.6889\n\nSo -ln(0.025) \u2248 3.6889\n\nThus,\n\n2n*(0.0001) \u2265 3.6889\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn \u2265 3.6889 / (2 * 0.0001) = 3.6889 / 0.0002 \u2248 18444.5\n\nSo n \u2248 18,445 examples. \n\nBut wait, that's assuming \u03b5 is 0.01 (1% absolute error). But the question says \"less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\", which might be a relative error. Let me see if that's possible. \n\nSuppose instead that the relative error is 1%, so |L_emp - L_true| / L_true \u2264 0.01. Then, rearranged, that gives |L_emp - L_true| \u2264 0.01 * L_true. \n\nBut here, L_true is a variable, so the \u03b5 in Hoeffding's inequality depends on L_true. To handle this, perhaps we can bound it in terms of the worst case. \n\nAlternatively, we can use a different form of Hoeffding's inequality that accounts for relative error. Wait, but Hoeffding is typically for absolute error. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a multiplicative form. Let me think. \n\nSuppose we want:\n\nP(L_emp \u2264 (1 + 0.01) L_true) \u2265 0.95\n\nBut that might not be exactly the same as the question's wording. Alternatively, the question might be ambiguous, but given that Hoeffding is about absolute error, perhaps the question actually means an absolute error of 1%, so \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"the estimate is less than 1% of the true loss\", which would mean L_emp < 0.01 L_true. But that would be a very strict requirement, and the probability of that happening would depend on the true loss. For example, if the true loss is 10%, then the estimate must be less than 0.1%, which is very small. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is actually asking for the estimate to be within 1% of the true loss, so the error is at most 1% of the true loss. That is, the relative error is 1%. \n\nIn that case, we can write:\n\n|L_emp - L_true| \u2264 0.01 L_true\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nL_true - 0.01 L_true \u2264 L_emp \u2264 L_true + 0.01 L_true\n\nSo,\n\n0.99 L_true \u2264 L_emp \u2264 1.01 L_true\n\nBut since L_emp is an average of 0/1 losses, it's between 0 and 1. \n\nHowever, Hoeffding's inequality is about the absolute difference, so we can write:\n\n|L_emp - L_true| \u2264 \u03b5, where \u03b5 = 0.01 L_true\n\nBut since L_true is unknown, we can't directly apply Hoeffding here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can bound this in terms of the worst case. Let me consider that the worst case for the relative error is when L_true is small. For example, if L_true is very small, then even a small absolute error could be a large relative error. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a different approach. Let me think of the multiplicative form. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the following approach: \n\nLet me denote the true loss as \u03bc = L_true. The empirical loss is the average of n independent Bernoulli trials with mean \u03bc. \n\nWe want:\n\nP(|L_emp - \u03bc| \u2264 0.01 \u03bc) \u2265 0.95\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nP(-0.01 \u03bc \u2264 L_emp - \u03bc \u2264 0.01 \u03bc) \u2265 0.95\n\nOr,\n\nP(\u03bc - 0.01 \u03bc \u2264 L_emp \u2264 \u03bc + 0.01 \u03bc) \u2265 0.95\n\nSo,\n\nP(0.99 \u03bc \u2264 L_emp \u2264 1.01 \u03bc) \u2265 0.95\n\nBut since L_emp is an average of Bernoulli variables, we can model this using Hoeffding's inequality. \n\nHowever, Hoeffding gives a bound on the probability that L_emp deviates from \u03bc by more than \u03b5, which is an absolute value. Here, the deviation is relative to \u03bc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set \u03b5 = 0.01 \u03bc, so that the absolute deviation is \u03b5 = 0.01 \u03bc. \n\nThen, using Hoeffding's inequality:\n\nP(|L_emp - \u03bc| \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 2 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2)\n\nWe want this probability to be \u2264 0.05, so:\n\n2 exp(-2n (0.01 \u03bc)^2 ) \u2264 0.05\n\nBut \u03bc is unknown. To make this work, we need to find an n such that for any \u03bc, this inequality holds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the worst-case \u03bc. Since \u03bc is between 0 and 1, the term (0.01 \u03bc)^2 is minimized when \u03bc is as small as possible. Wait, but if \u03bc is very small, then \u03b5 is also very small, so the required n would be very large. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the true loss is not too small? But the problem doesn't specify any prior knowledge about \u03bc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is intended to be interpreted as an absolute error of 1%, so \u03b5 = 0.01, which would make the problem straightforward. \n\nGiven that the problem mentions \"less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\", which is a bit ambiguous, but given that Hoeffding's inequality is about absolute error, and the question is from a machine learning context, it's possible that they actually mean an absolute error of 1%, so \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using \"less than 1 percent\" as an absolute value. Let me check the calculation again with \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nSo, using Hoeffding's inequality:\n\n2 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2) \u2264 0.05\n\nPlugging in \u03b5 = 0.01:\n\n2 exp(-2n*(0.0001)) \u2264 0.05\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nexp(-0.0002n) \u2264 0.025\n\nTake natural logarithm:\n\n-0.0002n \u2264 ln(0.025)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips):\n\n0.0002n \u2265 -ln(0.025)\n\nCompute -ln(0.025):\n\nln(0.025) \u2248 -3.6889, so -ln(0.025) \u2248 3.6889\n\nThus,\n\n0.0002n \u2265 3.6889\n\nSolving for n:\n\nn \u2265 3.6889 / 0.0002 \u2248 18,444.5\n\nSo n must be at least 18,445. \n\nTherefore, if the question is asking for an absolute error of 1%, then the answer is approximately 18,445 examples. \n\nAlternatively, if it's a relative error, then we need to handle it differently. Let me try that approach. \n\nSuppose we want the relative error to be at most 1%, so |L_emp - \u03bc| \u2264 0.01 \u03bc. \n\nThen, rearranged, this is equivalent to:\n\nL_emp \u2265 0.99 \u03bc and L_emp \u2264 1.01 \u03bc\n\nBut since L_emp is an average of Bernoulli variables, we can model this using Hoeffding. \n\nHowever, Hoeffding's inequality is for absolute differences. Let me see if I can manipulate the inequality to use Hoeffding. \n\nLet me consider the upper bound first: L_emp \u2264 1.01 \u03bc\n\nThis can be written as L_emp - \u03bc \u2264 0.01 \u03bc\n\nSimilarly, the lower bound: \u03bc - L_emp \u2264 0.01 \u03bc \u2192 L_emp \u2265 0.99 \u03bc\n\nBut Hoeffding can bound the probability that L_emp deviates from \u03bc by more than \u03b5 in either direction. \n\nHowever, in this case, the allowed deviation depends on \u03bc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a multiplicative form of Hoeffding's inequality. \n\nWait, there is a version of Hoeffding for multiplicative errors, but I need to recall. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the following approach. Let me consider the upper bound first. \n\nWe want P(L_emp \u2265 1.01 \u03bc) \u2264 0.025 (since we need the total probability of either exceeding or being below to be \u2264 0.05, so each tail is \u2264 0.025). \n\nSimilarly, P(L_emp \u2264 0.99 \u03bc) \u2264 0.025\n\nBut Hoeffding's inequality for the upper tail is:\n\nP(L_emp - \u03bc \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, for the lower tail:\n\nP(\u03bc - L_emp \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2)\n\nSo, if we set \u03b5_upper = 1.01 \u03bc - \u03bc = 0.01 \u03bc\n\nand \u03b5_lower = \u03bc - 0.99 \u03bc = 0.01 \u03bc\n\nThus, for both tails:\n\nexp(-2n (0.01 \u03bc)^2 ) \u2264 0.025\n\nWait, but this is similar to before. \n\nSo, setting exp(-2n (0.01 \u03bc)^2 ) \u2264 0.025\n\nTaking natural log:\n\n-2n (0.0001 \u03bc\u00b2) \u2264 ln(0.025)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n2n (0.0001 \u03bc\u00b2) \u2265 -ln(0.025)\n\nThus,\n\nn \u2265 (-ln(0.025)) / (2 * 0.0001 \u03bc\u00b2 )\n\nBut \u03bc is unknown here. To make this hold for any \u03bc, we need to consider the worst-case \u03bc. \n\nHowever, since \u03bc is between 0 and 1, the term \u03bc\u00b2 is maximized when \u03bc is 1, so the minimal n would be when \u03bc is 1. \n\nWait, but if \u03bc is small, then the required n becomes very large. For example, if \u03bc is 0.01, then \u03bc\u00b2 is 0.0001, so:\n\nn \u2265 3.6889 / (2 * 0.0001 * 0.0001) = 3.6889 / (0.00000002) \u2248 184,445,000\n\nWhich is way too big. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the true loss is not too small, but since it's not specified, maybe this approach is not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is indeed referring to an absolute error of 1%, so the answer is 18,445. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using \"less than 1 percent\" as an absolute error. Let me check the exact wording again: \"an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\". \n\nWait, \"less than 1 percent of the true loss\" would mean L_emp < 0.01 * L_true. But that would require the estimate to be much smaller than the true loss, which might not be the case. For example, if the true loss is 10%, then the estimate must be less than 0.1%, which is very strict. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a translation error or a misstatement, and they meant \"within 1% of the true loss\", which would make sense. \n\nGiven that in machine learning, when talking about error estimates, it's more common to refer to the absolute error unless specified otherwise. Also, Hoeffding's inequality is about absolute error. \n\nTherefore, I think the question is likely asking for an absolute error of 1%, so \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nTherefore, proceeding with that, the required n is approximately 18,445. \n\nBut let me confirm the calculation again. \n\nWe have:\n\n2 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2) \u2264 0.05\n\nSo,\n\nexp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2) \u2264 0.025\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-2n\u03b5\u00b2 \u2264 ln(0.025)\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n2n\u03b5\u00b2 \u2265 -ln(0.025)\n\nThus,\n\nn \u2265 (-ln(0.025)) / (2\u03b5\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in \u03b5 = 0.01,\n\nn \u2265 (3.6889) / (2*(0.0001)) = 3.6889 / 0.0002 \u2248 18,444.5\n\nSo n must be at least 18,445. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 18,445 examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using a one-tailed test? Wait, Hoeffding's inequality is two-tailed, so the 2 in the inequality accounts for both directions. \n\nAlternatively, if the question is only concerned with the estimate being less than the true loss by 1%, but that seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as \"the estimate is within 1% of the true loss\", so the absolute difference is less than 1%, so the same as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using \"less than 1 percent\" as in the estimate is within 1% of the true loss, so the maximum error is 1%, so the same as absolute error. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 18,445. \n\nWait, but let me check with \u03b5 = 0.01. Let me compute the exact value. \n\nCompute ln(0.025):\n\nln(0.025) = ln(25/1000) = ln(1/40) = -ln(40) \u2248 -3.68887945\n\nSo, -ln(0.025) \u2248 3.68887945\n\nThen,\n\nn \u2265 3.68887945 / (2*(0.01)^2) = 3.68887945 / (2*0.0001) = 3.68887945 / 0.0002 \u2248 18,444.397\n\nSo, rounding up, n = 18,445. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 18,445. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using a different form of Hoeffding's inequality. Let me recall that sometimes Hoeffding is written as:\n\nP(|L_emp - \u03bc| \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 2 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2)\n\nWhich is what I used. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's written with a factor of 1/(2n) or something else, but I think the standard form is as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a one-sided inequality? Let me see. \n\nIf we only care about the estimate being less than the true loss by 1%, then it's a one-tailed test. \n\nSuppose the question is \"the estimate is less than the true loss by less than 1%\", so L_emp \u2265 L_true - 0.01. \n\nWait, but the wording is \"less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\", which is still ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as the estimate is within 1% of the true loss, so the maximum error is 1%, so absolute error. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 18,445. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the true loss is \u03bc, and the empirical loss is L_emp. We want:\n\nP(|L_emp - \u03bc| \u2264 0.01 \u03bc) \u2265 0.95\n\nBut since \u03bc is unknown, perhaps we can bound this by considering the worst case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the following approach: \n\nLet me denote the relative error as \u03b4 = 0.01. \n\nWe want:\n\nP(|L_emp - \u03bc| \u2264 \u03b4 \u03bc) \u2265 0.95\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nP( (L_emp / \u03bc) - 1 \u2264 \u03b4 ) and P(1 - (L_emp / \u03bc) \u2264 \u03b4 )\n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the following inequality for relative error. \n\nThere is a version of Hoeffding's inequality for relative error, but I might need to derive it. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that:\n\nIf we want |L_emp - \u03bc| \u2264 \u03b4 \u03bc,\n\nthen,\n\nL_emp \u2265 \u03bc - \u03b4 \u03bc = \u03bc(1 - \u03b4)\n\nand\n\nL_emp \u2264 \u03bc + \u03b4 \u03bc = \u03bc(1 + \u03b4)\n\nTherefore, the probability that L_emp is within [\u03bc(1 - \u03b4), \u03bc(1 + \u03b4)] is at least 0.95. \n\nTo bound this using Hoeffding, we can consider the absolute deviations from \u03bc:\n\nFor the lower bound:\n\n\u03bc - L_emp \u2264 \u03b4 \u03bc \u2192 L_emp \u2265 \u03bc - \u03b4 \u03bc \u2192 deviation is \u03b4 \u03bc downward.\n\nSimilarly, the upper bound:\n\nL_emp - \u03bc \u2264 \u03b4 \u03bc \u2192 deviation is \u03b4 \u03bc upward.\n\nTherefore, the absolute deviation is \u03b4 \u03bc. \n\nTherefore, using Hoeffding's inequality for both tails:\n\nP(|L_emp - \u03bc| \u2265 \u03b4 \u03bc) \u2264 2 exp(-2n (\u03b4 \u03bc)^2 )\n\nWe want this probability to be \u2264 0.05, so:\n\n2 exp(-2n (\u03b4 \u03bc)^2 ) \u2264 0.05\n\nAgain, since \u03bc is unknown, we need to find n such that this holds for all \u03bc in [0,1]. \n\nThe worst case for the required n is when \u03bc is as small as possible because then \u03b4 \u03bc is small, so the required n would be large. \n\nHowever, if \u03bc approaches 0, then \u03b4 \u03bc approaches 0, so the required n would go to infinity, which is not practical. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the question assumes that the true loss \u03bc is bounded away from zero, but since it's not stated, maybe the question is indeed referring to an absolute error. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using \"less than 1 percent\" as an absolute error. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in terms of the estimate being within 1% of the true loss, so the maximum error is 1%, so \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nTherefore, given the ambiguity, but considering standard usage and Hoeffding's typical application, I think the answer is 18,445. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different approach where the 1% is relative to the true loss, but since that leads to a problem dependent on \u03bc, perhaps the question assumes that the true loss is 0.5 (the worst case for variance), so let's try that. \n\nSuppose \u03bc = 0.5, then \u03b5 = 0.01 * 0.5 = 0.005. \n\nThen, using Hoeffding:\n\n2 exp(-2n*(0.005)^2 ) \u2264 0.05\n\nCompute:\n\nexp(-2n*0.000025) \u2264 0.025\n\nTake ln:\n\n-2n*0.000025 \u2264 ln(0.025)\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n2n*0.000025 \u2265 3.6889\n\nThus,\n\nn \u2265 3.6889 / (2 * 0.000025) = 3.6889 / 0.00005 \u2248 73,778\n\nSo n \u2248 73,778. \n\nBut this is assuming \u03bc = 0.5. \n\nAlternatively, if \u03bc is 0.1, then \u03b5 = 0.001, leading to even larger n. \n\nAlternatively, if \u03bc is 1, then \u03b5 = 0.01, which brings us back to the original calculation of ~18,445. \n\nTherefore, if the question assumes that the true loss is 1 (which is the maximum possible), then the required n is 18,445. But that's an edge case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer in terms of the worst case, which would be when \u03bc is minimal. But since \u03bc can be as small as approaching 0, the required n would be unbounded, which is not feasible. \n\nTherefore, given the ambiguity, but considering that Hoeffding is typically used for absolute error and the question mentions \"less than 1 percent of the true loss\", which could be interpreted as an absolute error of 1%, I think the answer is 18,445. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using \"less than 1 percent\" as an absolute error, so the maximum allowed error is 1%, so \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 18,445. \n\nWait, but let me check with \u03b5 = 0.01. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a one-sided bound? Let me see. \n\nIf we only care about the estimate being less than the true loss by 1%, then it's a one-tailed test. \n\nSuppose the question is \"the estimate is less than the true loss by less than 1%\", so L_emp \u2265 L_true - 0.01. \n\nWait, but the wording is \"less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss\", which is still unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as the estimate is within 1% of the true loss, so the error is at most 1%, so absolute error. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 18,445. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the use of a different inequality, like the Chernoff bound, but Hoeffding is specified. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the answer in terms of the variance. Wait, Hoeffding's inequality is already being used here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the steps. \n\nWe have:\n\nWe want P(|L_emp - \u03bc| \u2265 \u03b5) \u2264 0.05\n\nUsing Hoeffding:\n\n2 exp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2) \u2264 0.05\n\nSolving for n:\n\nexp(-2n\u03b5\u00b2) \u2264 0.025\n\nTake natural log:\n\n-2n\u03b5\u00b2 \u2264 ln(0.025)\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n2n\u03b5\u00b2 \u2265 -ln(0.025)\n\nThus,\n\nn \u2265 (-ln(0.025)) / (2\u03b5\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in \u03b5 = 0.01,\n\nn \u2265 (3.6889) / (2*(0.0001)) = 3.6889 / 0.0002 \u2248 18,444.5\n\nSo n = 18,445. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 18,445. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting an approximate value, like 18,444 or 18,445. Since we can't have a fraction of an example, we round up to the next integer. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 18,445. \n\nBut let me check with \u03b5 = 0.01, n = 18,445:\n\nCompute 2 exp(-2 * 18445 * (0.01)^2 )\n\nFirst, compute exponent:\n\n-2 * 18445 * 0.0001 = -2 * 18445 * 0.0001 = -2 * 1.8445 = -3.689\n\nThus, exp(-3.689) \u2248 0.0248\n\nMultiply by 2: \u2248 0.0496, which is just under 0.05. \n\nTherefore, n = 18,445 gives a probability of approximately 4.96%, which is less than 5%. \n\nTherefore, that's correct. \n\nIf we use n = 18,444:\n\nExponent: -2 * 18444 * 0.0001 = -2 * 1.8444 = -3.6888\n\nexp(-3.6888) \u2248 e^-3.6888 \u2248 0.0248 (similar), so 2 * 0.0248 \u2248 0.0496 as well. \n\nWait, actually, the difference between 18,444 and 18,445 is negligible here because the exponent is continuous. \n\nTherefore, either 18,444 or 18,445 would work, but since we need to round up, 18,445 is the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 18,445. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe required number of examples is \\boxed{18445}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of examples required in an IID test set to ensure that the 0/1 loss estimate is within 1% of the true 0/1 loss with 95% probability using Hoeffding's inequality, we start by recalling Hoeffding's inequality:\n\n\\[\nP(|L_{\\text{emp}} - L_{\\text{true}}| \\geq \\epsilon) \\leq 2 \\exp(-2n\\epsilon^2)\n\\]\n\nWe need this probability to be less than or equal to 0.05 (for 95% confidence). Assuming the question refers to an absolute error of 1%, we set \\(\\epsilon = 0.01\\). Plugging this into Hoeffding's inequality:\n\n\\[\n2 \\exp(-2n(0.01)^2) \\leq 0.05\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(n\\):\n\n1. Divide both sides by 2:\n   \\[\n   \\exp(-2n \\cdot 0.0001) \\leq 0.025\n   \\]\n\n2. Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n   \\[\n   -2n \\cdot 0.0001 \\leq \\ln(0.025)\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute \\(\\ln(0.025)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\ln(0.025) \\approx -3.6889\n   \\]\n\n4. Multiply both sides by -1 and solve for \\(n\\):\n   \\[\n   2n \\cdot 0.0001 \\geq 3.6889\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n \\geq \\frac{3.6889}{2 \\cdot 0.0001} = \\frac{3.6889}{0.0002} \\approx 18444.5\n   \\]\n\nRounding up to the nearest integer, we get \\(n = 18445\\).\n\nThus, the required number of examples is \\(\\boxed{18445}\\)."
