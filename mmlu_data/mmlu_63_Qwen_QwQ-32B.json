        "question": "A model airplane flies slower when flying into the wind and faster with wind at its back. When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a model airplane and how its groundspeed changes when flying into the wind versus with the wind, and specifically when it's launched at a right angle to the wind, which is called a crosswind. The question is asking how the groundspeed compares to when it's flying in still air. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic concepts about wind affecting an airplane's speed. I remember that when an airplane is flying into the wind, its groundspeed is reduced by the wind speed. Conversely, when it's flying with the wind, the groundspeed is increased by the wind speed. But this question is about when the plane is flying at a right angle to the wind, so that's a crosswind situation. I need to figure out how that crosswind affects the groundspeed compared to still air.\n\nLet me start by defining some variables. Let's say the plane's airspeed (its speed relative to the air) is 'v'. The wind speed is 'w'. When the plane is flying directly into the wind or with the wind, the groundspeed is straightforward: it's either v - w or v + w. But when it's flying at a right angle, the wind is coming from the side, so the effect isn't as straightforward. \n\nI think this is a vector addition problem. The plane's velocity relative to the air is a vector, and the wind's velocity is another vector. The groundspeed is the resultant vector when you add these two vectors together. Since the plane is flying at a right angle to the wind, the two vectors are perpendicular to each other. \n\nLet me visualize this. Suppose the wind is blowing from the north to the south, so its velocity vector is pointing south. If the plane is flying due east relative to the air, then its velocity relative to the air is eastward. The groundspeed vector would then be the combination of the plane's eastward motion and the wind's southward motion. The actual path over the ground would be southeast, but the groundspeed is the magnitude of that resultant vector.\n\nTo find the groundspeed, I need to calculate the magnitude of the resultant vector when two perpendicular vectors are added. The formula for the magnitude of the resultant vector when two vectors are perpendicular is the square root of (v squared plus w squared). Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. If you have two vectors at right angles, the resultant's magnitude is indeed the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides equal to the magnitudes of the two vectors. So yes, groundspeed would be sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2). \n\nBut hold on, the question is asking how this groundspeed compares to flying in still air. When there's no wind, the groundspeed is just the airspeed 'v'. So in the crosswind case, the groundspeed is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is greater than 'v' because we're adding the square of the wind speed. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. If the wind is blowing perpendicular, does that actually make the groundspeed faster? \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think about this again. Let me consider an example. Suppose the plane's airspeed is 10 m/s, and the wind speed is 5 m/s. If the plane is flying into the wind, groundspeed is 5 m/s; with the wind, it's 15 m/s. But when flying perpendicular, the groundspeed would be sqrt(10\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) = sqrt(125) \u2248 11.18 m/s. That is indeed higher than the still air speed of 10 m/s. Wait, so the groundspeed is actually higher when there's a crosswind? That seems odd because I thought crosswind doesn't help or hinder speed, but maybe mathematically it does?\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The plane's airspeed is its speed relative to the air mass. If the air mass itself is moving due to wind, then the groundspeed is the vector sum. So if the plane is moving east at 10 m/s relative to the air, and the air is moving south at 5 m/s relative to the ground, then the plane's groundspeed vector is northeast (if wind is from the north) but the magnitude is sqrt(10\u00b2 +5\u00b2). So the speed over ground is indeed higher. \n\nBut why does that happen? Because even though the wind is pushing the plane sideways, the plane's own motion is in a different direction, so the resultant vector's magnitude is larger. So in effect, the crosswind doesn't directly add or subtract from the plane's speed in the direction it's heading, but the total groundspeed (the actual speed over the ground) is higher because of the diagonal path. \n\nTherefore, compared to still air, where the groundspeed is just the airspeed, in a crosswind, the groundspeed is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is greater than v. Therefore, the groundspeed is faster than in still air? Wait, but the question says \"compared with flying in still air\". So the answer would be that the groundspeed is greater? But I need to confirm this again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me check with another example. Suppose the plane's airspeed is 10 m/s, and the wind speed is 0. Then groundspeed is 10 m/s. If wind speed is 5 m/s crosswind, then groundspeed is sqrt(125) \u224811.18 m/s. So yes, it's higher. So the groundspeed is actually higher when there's a crosswind? That seems correct mathematically, but is that the case in reality?\n\nWait, but in aviation, when you have a crosswind, your groundspeed isn't necessarily higher. Wait, maybe I'm confusing groundspeed with the speed over the ground in the direction of travel. Wait, no, groundspeed is the actual speed over the ground, regardless of direction. So if you're flying perpendicular to the wind, your groundspeed vector's magnitude is indeed higher. \n\nWait, but in aviation, when you have a crosswind, you have to crab the aircraft into the wind to maintain your track, but the groundspeed might still be affected. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the plane's movement. If the plane is trying to go in a certain direction, but the wind is pushing it sideways, the pilot would adjust the heading to compensate, but the airspeed is maintained. However, the groundspeed's magnitude would still be the vector sum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the plane is flying at a right angle to the wind without any correction, so that its heading is directly into the crosswind, so that the resultant path is diagonal. In that case, the groundspeed would indeed be higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that when flying in a crosswind, the plane's groundspeed in the direction perpendicular to the wind is the same as its airspeed, but the total groundspeed is higher? \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is between the plane's speed over the ground in the direction it's heading versus the total groundspeed. Let me clarify. \n\nSuppose the plane is trying to fly north, but there's a west wind. The pilot would have to point the plane slightly west to compensate, so that the wind's eastward push cancels out the westward heading, resulting in a northward track. In that case, the plane's airspeed is still 10 m/s, but the groundspeed north would still be 10 m/s, but the total groundspeed would be higher because of the sideways component? Wait, no, if the pilot is compensating, then the groundspeed north would be 10 m/s, but the total groundspeed would actually be less because part of the airspeed is used to counteract the wind. Wait, now I'm confused again.\n\nHold on, maybe I need to recall the difference between airspeed, groundspeed, and wind vectors. \n\nThe airspeed is the plane's speed relative to the air mass. The wind is the movement of the air mass relative to the ground. The groundspeed is the plane's speed relative to the ground. \n\nIf the plane is flying with a heading (the direction the plane is pointing) at a right angle to the wind, then the airspeed vector is perpendicular to the wind vector. The groundspeed is the vector sum of the airspeed and wind vectors. \n\nTherefore, if the plane's heading is perpendicular to the wind direction, then the groundspeed's magnitude is sqrt(airspeed\u00b2 + wind speed\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, the groundspeed is greater than the airspeed. \n\nTherefore, compared to flying in still air (where groundspeed equals airspeed), the groundspeed in a crosswind is higher. \n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because when you have a crosswind, you might think it doesn't affect your speed over the ground in the direction you want to go, but actually, the total speed over the ground is higher because you're moving diagonally. \n\nWait, but in terms of navigation, if you want to go from point A to point B, a crosswind would require you to adjust your heading, but your groundspeed along the desired path would be less than your airspeed because part of your airspeed is being used to counteract the crosswind. However, the total groundspeed (the actual speed over the ground, regardless of direction) would still be sqrt(airspeed\u00b2 + wind\u00b2). \n\nHmm, so maybe the question is ambiguous? Wait, the question says \"groundspeed compared with flying in still air\". Groundspeed is the total speed over the ground, so in crosswind, it's higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that when flying at a right angle to the wind, the groundspeed in the direction of the plane's heading is the same as airspeed, but the total groundspeed is higher. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let me use vectors. Let's suppose the wind is along the y-axis, say positive y is wind direction. The plane is flying along the x-axis. The plane's airspeed vector is (v, 0). The wind vector is (0, w). The groundspeed vector is (v, w). The magnitude is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2). So the groundspeed is indeed higher. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"when launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is...\" So the answer is that it's higher? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check with another perspective. Suppose the plane is flying in still air at 10 m/s. Groundspeed is 10 m/s. If there's a crosswind of 5 m/s, then when flying perpendicular, the groundspeed is sqrt(100 +25)=sqrt(125)=~11.18 m/s. So yes, higher. \n\nAlternatively, if the wind was headwind or tailwind, then groundspeed would be 5 or 15, so in crosswind it's in between? Wait no, sqrt(125) is about 11.18, which is between 10 and 15. Wait, but actually, when flying perpendicular, the groundspeed is higher than still air but less than the maximum possible with a tailwind. \n\nWait, but the question is just comparing crosswind to still air. So crosswind gives higher groundspeed. \n\nHmm, but I need to confirm if this is the standard understanding. Let me think of a boat in water. If a boat is moving perpendicular to the current, its groundspeed would be the vector sum, so higher in magnitude. Similarly, an airplane in crosswind would have higher groundspeed. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is a trick question? Let me read again: \"When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is...\" Maybe \"cross wind\" here is redundant, but the key is right angles. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from the perspective of the plane's intended direction. If the plane is trying to fly in a certain direction, but the crosswind is pushing it sideways, so the groundspeed in the intended direction is less? But the question says \"groundspeed\", which is the total speed over ground, not the component in a particular direction. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose the plane's airspeed is 100 knots, and the wind is 50 knots from the north (so blowing south). If the plane is flying due east, then the groundspeed vector is 100 east and 50 south, so the magnitude is sqrt(100\u00b2 +50\u00b2)=~111.8 knots. So yes, higher than 100. \n\nAlternatively, if the wind was 100 knots, then groundspeed would be sqrt(100\u00b2 +100\u00b2)=141.4, which is higher. \n\nTherefore, mathematically, the groundspeed is always higher when there is a crosswind, compared to still air. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that the plane's engine is providing thrust to maintain airspeed, so in crosswind, the plane isn't going any faster through the air, but the groundspeed is higher because the wind is carrying it sideways. \n\nYes, exactly. The airspeed is the same, but the groundspeed is higher. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nHmm, but I want to make sure there isn't a different interpretation. Maybe the question is considering that when flying into the wind or with the wind, the groundspeed is directly affected, but when flying crosswind, the groundspeed remains the same as still air? But that contradicts the vector math. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the groundspeed is the same? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in two dimensions. The plane's velocity relative to the air is perpendicular to the wind's velocity. The groundspeed is the vector sum. The magnitude is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2). Since both v and w are positive, this is greater than v. Therefore, the groundspeed is greater. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where the answer is \"the same\", but that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the vectors are perpendicular. Let me confirm. \n\nIf the plane is launched at right angles to the wind, that means the plane's direction of flight is perpendicular to the wind direction. So the plane's airspeed vector is perpendicular to the wind vector. Therefore, their sum is the hypotenuse. \n\nTherefore, the groundspeed is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is greater than v. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that crosswind doesn't affect groundspeed? But according to the math, it does. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the plane's speed relative to the ground in the direction of the wind is zero? Wait, no. \n\nWait, let me think of it another way. Suppose the wind is blowing from the north at speed w, and the plane is flying due east at speed v (airspeed). Then, relative to the ground, the plane is moving east at v and south at w (because the wind is pushing it south). Therefore, the groundspeed is the combination of those two, so sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, the groundspeed is indeed higher. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nHmm, so I think that's the conclusion. The key is recognizing that when vectors are perpendicular, their magnitudes add in quadrature, leading to a higher resultant speed. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the groundspeed is greater than when flying in still air. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other possible interpretation. For instance, maybe the question is referring to the component of groundspeed in the direction of the plane's heading? In that case, if the plane is heading into the crosswind, the component of groundspeed in the direction of the heading would be the same as the airspeed, because the wind is perpendicular. So in that case, the groundspeed in the direction of flight is the same as still air, but the total groundspeed is higher. \n\nHowever, the question says \"groundspeed\", which is the total speed over the ground, not the component in a particular direction. Therefore, the total groundspeed is higher. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where the answer is \"the same\", but according to physics, it's higher. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the wind is a vector adding to the plane's velocity. Let me recall that wind velocity is added to the plane's airspeed to get groundspeed. \n\nYes, that's correct. The groundspeed vector is the airspeed vector plus the wind vector. \n\nTherefore, if the two vectors are perpendicular, the magnitude is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is greater than in still air. \n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct conclusion. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe groundspeed is greater than in still air, so the answer is \\boxed{greater}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how the groundspeed of a model airplane flying at a right angle to the wind (crosswind) compares to its groundspeed in still air, we need to consider vector addition of the airplane's airspeed and the wind speed.\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( v \\) be the airplane's airspeed (speed relative to the air).\n   - Let \\( w \\) be the wind speed.\n\n2. **Vector Addition**:\n   - When flying at a right angle to the wind, the airplane's airspeed vector and the wind vector are perpendicular to each other.\n   - The groundspeed is the magnitude of the resultant vector formed by adding these two perpendicular vectors.\n\n3. **Resultant Vector Calculation**:\n   - The magnitude of the resultant vector (groundspeed) is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Groundspeed} = \\sqrt{v^2 + w^2}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Comparison with Still Air**:\n   - In still air, the groundspeed is simply the airplane's airspeed \\( v \\).\n   - Since \\( \\sqrt{v^2 + w^2} \\) is always greater than \\( v \\) (because \\( w \\) is a positive value), the groundspeed in a crosswind is greater than the groundspeed in still air.\n\nThus, the groundspeed when flying at a right angle to the wind is greater than when flying in still air.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{greater}\n\\]"
