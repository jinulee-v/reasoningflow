        "response": "The body cavity that contains the pituitary gland is the cranial cavity. The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain, within the sella turcica, a bony structure in the sphenoid bone of the skull. This gland is often referred to as the \"master gland\" because it regulates the functions of other endocrine glands and plays a crucial role in growth, metabolism, and reproduction."
