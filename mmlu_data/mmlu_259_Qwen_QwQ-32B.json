        "question": "Earth Hour was a campaign launched by which organization?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which organization launched Earth Hour. Let me start by recalling what I know about Earth Hour. I remember it's an annual event where people are encouraged to turn off their non-essential lights for one hour to raise awareness about climate change. But which organization is behind it?\n\nHmm, I think it might be a global environmental organization. Maybe something like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)? I've heard WWF involved in various environmental campaigns. Let me think if there's any connection between WWF and Earth Hour. \n\nWait, I think Earth Hour started in Sydney, Australia. If that's the case, maybe it was initiated by a local group there before going global? But then again, WWF is an international organization, so perhaps they took it up and expanded it worldwide. \n\nI should also consider other possible organizations. There's Greenpeace, but I don't recall them being the founders of Earth Hour. The United Nations has various environmental initiatives, but Earth Hour seems more like a grassroots or NGO-led event. \n\nLet me try to remember any news articles or ads about Earth Hour. The ones I've seen often have the WWF logo. That might be a clue. Also, doing a quick mental check: Earth Hour's website, if I recall correctly, is linked with WWF. \n\nAnother angle: when was Earth Hour started? I think it was around 2007. If I can link the founding year with an organization's involvement, that might help. A quick search in my memory: yes, Earth Hour began in 2007 in Sydney, organized by the WWF in collaboration with the Sydney Morning Herald. Then it spread to other cities. \n\nSo putting it all together, the original campaign was by WWF Australia, and then it became a global initiative under WWF's leadership. Therefore, the answer should be the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). I don't think I'm mixing it up with another event. Let me see if there's any conflicting information. No, I can't think of another major organization claiming to have started Earth Hour. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's WWF.\n</think>\n\nEarth Hour was launched by the **World Wildlife Fund (WWF)**. The campaign began in Sydney, Australia, in 2007 as a way to raise awareness about climate change. Initially organized by WWF Australia in collaboration with The Sydney Morning Herald, it has since grown into a global movement, with millions of people, businesses, and landmarks participating annually by turning off non-essential lights for one hour. The event aims to inspire action on sustainability and environmental protection."
