        "question": "According to Timothy Pauketat, the evidence for social stratification and political power at Cahokia suggests:",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what Timothy Pauketat says about social stratification and political power at Cahokia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Cahokia. It was a major Mississippian culture site near present-day St. Louis, right? They had that big mound, Monks Mound, which is really impressive. I remember that Cahokia was a significant urban center with a complex society.\n\nNow, social stratification refers to the division of society into different classes or ranks. Political power would involve how leadership was structured and how decisions were made. Pauketat is an archaeologist who has written about Cahokia, so I should think about his specific arguments.\n\nI think he might argue that there was a clear hierarchy. Maybe the presence of large mounds like Monks Mound indicates that some people had more power or status. The elite might have lived on or near the mounds. There's also evidence of craft specialization, like the creation of ceremonial objects, which could be controlled by the elite. \n\nI remember reading that Cahokia had a centralized political system. Perhaps Pauketat suggests that there was a paramount chief or a ruling class that controlled resources and labor. The construction of the mounds would require organized labor, so that implies some form of political authority directing such projects.\n\nAlso, there's the Woodhenge, which was an astronomical calendar. That might be linked to religious or ceremonial authority, reinforcing the political leader's role as a spiritual figure. The combination of religious and political power could be a point he makes.\n\nHe might also discuss the defensive structures, like palisades around Cahokia. If they built walls, that could indicate the need to protect the elite or the central area from external threats, showing a society with internal and external conflicts managed by those in power.\n\nI should also consider any artifacts found, like the Mississippian culture's shell gorgets or ceremonial copper items. These items might have been symbols of status, controlled by the elite. Pauketat could argue that such items were used to display power and reinforce social hierarchy.\n\nWait, I should check if he specifically mentions the role of Cahokia as a regional center. Maybe he talks about how it influenced surrounding areas through trade or political alliances, indicating a broader political power beyond just the local community.\n\nAlso, the decline of Cahokia might be linked to the breakdown of this social structure. But the question is about the evidence for stratification and political power, so maybe focus on the peak period.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not conflating other scholars' views with Pauketat's. Let me think of his specific contributions. He wrote \"Cahokia: Ancient America's Great City on the Mississippi,\" so in that book, he probably emphasizes the complexity of Cahokia's society. He might argue that the scale of the site, the mounds, the artifacts, and the infrastructure all point to a highly stratified society with a powerful political elite.\n\nHe might also discuss the role of Cahokia in the Mississippian world, perhaps as a central place with a theocratic government where the leader's authority was tied to religious beliefs. The combination of political and religious power would centralize control.\n\nAnother point could be the distribution of goods. If certain areas had more luxury items, that would indicate social stratification. Excavations might show that elite residences had more valuable items, while common areas had simpler goods.\n\nAlso, the presence of human sacrifices or ritual burials with high-status items could be evidence of a hierarchy. If some individuals were buried with more grave goods, that's a sign of social stratification.\n\nI should structure this into points: evidence from mounds, artifacts, defensive structures, craft specialization, religious structures like Woodhenge, and the distribution of resources. Each of these would support the idea of a stratified society with centralized political power.\n\nWait, but I need to be precise about Pauketat's arguments. Maybe he emphasizes the rapid emergence of Cahokia as a planned city, suggesting deliberate political organization. The layout of the city, with mounds arranged in specific patterns, might indicate a centralized authority directing urban planning.\n\nHe might also discuss the influence of Cahokia beyond its immediate area, through trade networks or cultural influence, which would require political power to maintain such connections.\n\nI think that's a good start. Now I need to present this in a coherent answer, making sure to attribute the points to Pauketat and connect them to social stratification and political power.\n</think>\n\nAccording to Timothy Pauketat, the evidence for social stratification and political power at Cahokia, a major Mississippian culture site near present-day St. Louis, indicates a highly organized and hierarchical society with centralized authority. Key points from his analysis include:\n\n1. **Architectural Evidence**:  \n   - The construction of monumental earthen mounds, such as **Monks Mound** (the largest), suggests a stratified society where elites directed labor and resources. The elite likely resided on or near these mounds, symbolizing their elevated status.  \n   - The **planned urban layout**, including aligned mounds and the **Woodhenge** (an astronomical calendar), reflects centralized authority capable of orchestrating large-scale projects and managing symbolic spaces tied to cosmology and ritual.\n\n2. **Political Centralization**:  \n   - Pauketat argues for a **paramount chief or ruling class** that controlled Cahokia\u2019s political and religious life. The combination of political and spiritual authority (e.g., interpreting celestial events via Woodhenge) legitimized elite power, creating a theocratic governance system.  \n   - Defensive structures like **palisades** and watchtowers imply the need to protect the elite or central areas from external threats, reinforcing the idea of a centralized authority managing security and social control.\n\n3. **Economic and Social Stratification**:  \n   - **Craft specialization** (e.g., shell gorgets, ceremonial copperwork) and trade networks (extending across the Midwest and Southeast) were likely controlled by elites, who monopolized luxury goods as symbols of status.  \n   - Grave goods distribution shows disparities: high-status individuals were buried with elaborate artifacts, while commoners had simpler burials, indicating a rigid class structure.\n\n4. **Regional Influence**:  \n   - Cahokia\u2019s role as a **regional hub** suggests it exerted political and cultural influence over surrounding communities through trade, diplomacy, or coercion. Pauketat highlights its emergence as a \"great city\" around 1050 CE, implying rapid centralization under elite leadership.\n\n5. **Ceremonial and Ritual Authority**:  \n   - The **Cahokia Burial Mound** (Mound 72), with its mass graves and elite burials accompanied by thousands of marine shells, underscores the power of rulers to mobilize labor and resources for rituals, further cementing their authority.\n\nPauketat emphasizes that Cahokia\u2019s complexity\u2014its monumental architecture, planned cityscape, and economic networks\u2014was enabled by a **centralized political system** that reinforced social stratification. This system allowed elites to control labor, ritual practices, and trade, positioning Cahokia as a pivotal center in the Mississippian world. His work underscores the interplay between political power and social hierarchy in sustaining such a large, organized society."
