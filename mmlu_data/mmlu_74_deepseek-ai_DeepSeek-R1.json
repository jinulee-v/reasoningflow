        "question": "A point pole has a strength of 4\u03c0 * 10^-4 weber. The force in newtons on a point pole of 4\u03c0 * 1.5 * 10^-4 weber placed at a distance of 10 cm from it will be",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the force between two point poles. The problem states that one pole has a strength of 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 weber, and the other is 4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 weber. They're placed 10 cm apart. Hmm, right, magnetic poles. So, I remember there's a formula for the force between two magnetic poles, similar to Coulomb's law for electric charges. Let me recall.\n\nThe formula should be something like F = (m1 * m2) / (4\u03c0\u03bc r\u00b2), where m1 and m2 are the pole strengths, \u03bc is the permeability of the medium, and r is the distance between them. Since the problem doesn't mention any specific medium, I guess we can assume it's in air or vacuum. The permeability of free space, \u03bc\u2080, is 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m (henrys per meter). Let me confirm that. Yeah, \u03bc\u2080 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m. So, substituting that into the formula.\n\nWait, but sometimes the formula is written as F = (m1 * m2) / (\u03bc * 4\u03c0 r\u00b2). Let me check the exact formula. Hmm. Actually, the force between two magnetic poles is given by F = (\u03bc / 4\u03c0) * (m1 * m2) / r\u00b2. Wait, now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's think in terms of units. Weber is the unit of magnetic pole strength, right? And force is in newtons. Permeability \u03bc has units of H/m (henrys per meter). Let's see. If F = (m1 * m2) / (4\u03c0\u03bc r\u00b2), then the units would be (Wb\u00b2) / (H/m * m\u00b2) = (Wb\u00b2) / (H * m). Since 1 Wb = 1 H*A (because inductance is henrys, and weber is H*A), so substituting, we get (H\u00b2 A\u00b2) / (H * m) = H A\u00b2 / m. Hmm, H is H, A is ampere. What's the unit of force? Newton is kg*m/s\u00b2. Hmm, not sure if that's matching.\n\nAlternatively, if F = (\u03bc / 4\u03c0) * (m1 * m2) / r\u00b2, then units would be (H/m) * (Wb\u00b2) / m\u00b2 = (H/m * Wb\u00b2) / m\u00b2. Again, substituting Wb = H*A, so H/m * (H\u00b2 A\u00b2) / m\u00b2 = H\u00b3 A\u00b2 / m\u00b3. That seems even more complicated. Maybe I need to recall the correct formula.\n\nWait, maybe I should refer to the formula for the force between two magnetic monopoles. Since weber is the unit for magnetic charge, the formula should be analogous to Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law for electric charges is F = (1/(4\u03c0\u03b5)) * (q1 q2)/r\u00b2. So, for magnetic charges, it should be F = (1/(4\u03c0\u03bc)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. Yes, that makes sense. Because electric field uses \u03b5 (permittivity) and magnetic field uses \u03bc (permeability). So substituting \u03bc\u2080 for vacuum, the formula becomes F = (1/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, \u03bc\u2080 is 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m. So substituting that into the formula, F = (1/(4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. Let me compute that coefficient. 1/(4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7) = 1/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7) = 10^7/(16\u03c0\u00b2). Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe it simplifies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is written as F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. Wait, let's check units again. If F is in newtons, \u03bc\u2080 is H/m, m1 and m2 are in webers, and r is in meters. Then:\n\n\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) has units H/m. (m1 m2) is Wb\u00b2. So H/m * Wb\u00b2 / m\u00b2 = H*Wb\u00b2 / m\u00b3. But H is Wb/(A), so substituting, we get (Wb/(A) * Wb\u00b2) / m\u00b3 = Wb\u00b3/(A m\u00b3). But Wb is V*s, so V*s/(A) is ohms*seconds. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I need to trust the formula.\n\nWait, let's look up the formula for force between two magnetic poles. According to my notes, the force between two magnetic poles of strength m1 and m2 separated by distance r in a medium with permeability \u03bc is F = (\u03bc/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. So in SI units, if \u03bc is the absolute permeability, then yes. So in vacuum or air, \u03bc = \u03bc\u2080 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m. Therefore, substituting into the formula, F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2 = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m / 4\u03c0) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2 = 10^-7 H/m * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2.\n\nBut H (henry) is equivalent to Wb/(A), so H/m is Wb/(A*m). But Weber is equivalent to V*s or T*m\u00b2. Hmm, maybe I can express it in terms of known units. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, since weber is the unit for magnetic pole strength, and the formula is F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0 \u03bc r\u00b2). Let's try that. Then, substituting \u03bc = \u03bc\u2080 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7, so F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 * r\u00b2) = (m1 m2)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * r\u00b2). Let's compute this.\n\nGiven m1 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb, m2 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb, r = 10 cm = 0.1 m.\n\nSo m1 * m2 = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = (4\u03c0)(4\u03c0)(1.5)(10^-4)(10^-4) = 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-8.\n\nThen denominator is 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * (0.1)^2 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * 0.01 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\nSo F = (16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-8) / (16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9) = (1.5 * 10^-8) / (10^-9) = 1.5 * 10^1 = 15 N.\n\nWait, that gives 15 newtons? Let me check again.\n\nWait, numerator: m1 * m2 = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = 4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 * 10^-4 * 1.5 * 10^-4 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-8.\n\nDenominator: 4\u03c0 * \u03bc * r\u00b2. Wait, hold on. Wait, original formula: F = (m1 * m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc r\u00b2). So \u03bc is 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7, so denominator is 4\u03c0 * (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7) * (0.1)^2.\n\nCompute denominator: 4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 * 0.01 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\nSo F = (16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8) / (16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9) = (1.5 \u00d7 10^-8)/(10^-9) = 1.5 \u00d7 10^1 = 15 N. Yes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, using the other form of the formula: F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2.\n\n\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7)/(4\u03c0) = 10^-7.\n\nThen F = 10^-7 * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2.\n\nCompute m1 m2 = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8.\n\nThen F = 10^-7 * (16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8) / (0.1)^2.\n\nWait, denominator is r\u00b2 = 0.01 m\u00b2.\n\nSo F = 10^-7 * (16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8) / 0.01.\n\nCompute numerator: 10^-7 * 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-8 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-15.\n\nDivide by 0.01: 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-15 / 0.01 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-13.\n\nWait, this seems different. Wait, no, maybe I messed up.\n\nWait, let's do step by step.\n\nFirst, F = 10^-7 * (m1 * m2) / r\u00b2.\n\nCompute m1 * m2 = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = (4\u03c0)(4\u03c0)(10^-4)(1.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8.\n\nSo F = 10^-7 * (16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8) / (0.1)^2.\n\nCompute denominator: (0.1)^2 = 0.01.\n\nSo F = 10^-7 * 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8 / 0.01.\n\nMultiply 10^-7 and 10^-8: 10^-15.\n\nSo F = 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 \u00d7 10^-15 / 0.01.\n\nDivide by 0.01 is multiply by 100: 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWait, but \u03c0\u00b2 is approximately 10, so 16*10*1.5 = 240, so 240 \u00d7 10^-13 = 2.4 \u00d7 10^-11 N? That contradicts the previous result. Wait, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, hold on. There must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check again.\n\nFirst method:\n\nFormula: F = (m1 * m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc r\u00b2)\n\nGiven \u03bc = \u03bc\u2080 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nF = (m1 * m2)/(4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 * r\u00b2) = (m1 * m2)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * r\u00b2)\n\nCompute numerator: m1 * m2 = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8.\n\nDenominator: 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 \u00d7 (0.1)^2 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 \u00d7 0.01 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\nThus, F = (16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9) = (1.5 \u00d7 10^-8)/(10^-9) = 1.5 \u00d7 10^1 = 15 N.\n\nSecond method:\n\nFormula: F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 * m2)/r\u00b2.\n\n\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7)/(4\u03c0) = 10^-7.\n\nThus, F = 10^-7 * (m1 * m2)/r\u00b2.\n\nCompute m1 * m2 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8 as before.\n\nr\u00b2 = 0.01.\n\nThus, F = 10^-7 * (16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8)/0.01.\n\nCompute numerator: 10^-7 * 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-15.\n\nDivide by 0.01: 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-15 / 0.01 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nWait, but \u03c0\u00b2 is approximately 9.87, so 16 * 9.87 \u2248 157.92, times 1.5 is \u2248 236.88, times 10^-13 \u2248 2.3688 \u00d7 10^-11 N. Which is way smaller than 15 N. So conflicting results. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, why the discrepancy? Which formula is correct?\n\nWait, let's check a reference. According to the book \"Introduction to Electrodynamics\" by David J. Griffiths, the force between two magnetic monopoles (if they existed) would be F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. So that formula is correct. So then why does the first method give 15 N and the second method gives 2.36 \u00d7 10^-11 N? There must be a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's recalculate using the second method.\n\nFormula: F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03bc\u2080 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 H/m.\n\nm1 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb.\n\nm2 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb.\n\nr = 0.1 m.\n\nCompute \u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7)/(4\u03c0) = 10^-7 H/m.\n\nCompute m1 * m2 = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8 Wb\u00b2.\n\nCompute r\u00b2 = 0.01 m\u00b2.\n\nSo F = 10^-7 * (16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8) / 0.01.\n\nFirst, multiply 10^-7 and 10^-8: 10^-15.\n\nThen, 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u2248 16 * 9.8696 * 1.5 \u2248 16 * 14.804 \u2248 236.864.\n\nSo 236.864 \u00d7 10^-15 / 0.01 = 236.864 \u00d7 10^-13 = 2.36864 \u00d7 10^-11 N.\n\nBut according to the first method, it's 15 N. These can't both be right. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the first method incorrectly applied the formula. Let me check the first method again.\n\nFirst method:\n\nFormula: F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc r\u00b2).\n\n\u03bc = \u03bc\u2080 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7.\n\nThus, F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 * r\u00b2) = (m1 m2)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * r\u00b2).\n\nCompute numerator: m1 m2 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8.\n\nDenominator: 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * (0.1)^2 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * 0.01 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\nThus, F = (16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-8)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9) = (1.5 \u00d7 10^-8)/(10^-9) = 1.5 \u00d7 10^1 = 15 N.\n\nBut according to the second method, which references Griffiths, it's 2.36 \u00d7 10^-11 N. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the first formula is wrong. Let me check the units again.\n\nIn the first formula, F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc r\u00b2). Let's check units:\n\nm1 and m2 are in webers (Wb). \u03bc is in H/m. r is in meters.\n\nSo units of numerator: Wb\u00b2.\n\nUnits of denominator: 4\u03c0\u03bc r\u00b2: 4\u03c0 * H/m * m\u00b2 = 4\u03c0 H*m.\n\nThus, overall units: Wb\u00b2 / (H*m). Since Wb = H*A (from inductance, V = L dI/dt, so Weber = V*s = H*A), so Wb = H*A.\n\nThus, Wb\u00b2 = H\u00b2 A\u00b2.\n\nDenominator: H*m.\n\nThus, units: H\u00b2 A\u00b2 / (H*m) = H A\u00b2 / m.\n\nBut H (henry) is equivalent to Wb/A, so H = Wb/A. Therefore, substituting:\n\nH A\u00b2 / m = (Wb/A) * A\u00b2 / m = Wb A / m.\n\nBut Wb is V*s, and V is J/C, so Wb A / m = (J/C * s) * A / m. J is N*m, so:\n\n(N*m/C * s) * A / m = N*s/C * A / m.\n\nBut C = A*s, so N*s/(A*s) * A / m = N/(A) * A / m = N/m.\n\nWait, that gives units of N/m, but force should be N. So there's a discrepancy. Therefore, the first formula's units don't check out. Therefore, the first formula must be wrong.\n\nWhereas the second formula, F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2.\n\nUnits: \u03bc\u2080 is H/m. m1 m2 is Wb\u00b2. r\u00b2 is m\u00b2.\n\nThus, units: (H/m) * (Wb\u00b2)/m\u00b2 = H*Wb\u00b2/m\u00b3.\n\nBut H = Wb/(A), so substituting:\n\n(Wb/(A)) * Wb\u00b2 / m\u00b3 = Wb\u00b3/(A m\u00b3).\n\nBut Wb = V*s = (N*m/C)*s. Since C = A*s, so Wb = (N*m/(A*s)) * s = N*m/A.\n\nThus, Wb\u00b3/(A m\u00b3) = (N*m/A)^3 / (A m\u00b3) = N\u00b3 m\u00b3 / (A^3) / (A m\u00b3) = N\u00b3 / A^4.\n\nHmm, that's not matching Newtons. So perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using SI base units.\n\nWeber (Wb) is equivalent to V\u00b7s = (N\u00b7m/C)\u00b7s = (N\u00b7m/(A\u00b7s))\u00b7s = N\u00b7m/A.\n\nSo 1 Wb = N\u00b7m/A.\n\nThus, m1 and m2 are in N\u00b7m/A.\n\n\u03bc\u2080 is in H/m = Wb/(A\u00b7m) = (N\u00b7m/A)/(A\u00b7m) = N/(A\u00b2\u00b7m).\n\nSo \u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) has units N/(A\u00b2\u00b7m).\n\nThus, F = (N/(A\u00b2\u00b7m)) * (N\u00b7m/A * N\u00b7m/A) / m\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's compute:\n\n\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) has units N/(A\u00b2\u00b7m).\n\nm1 * m2 has units (N\u00b7m/A)^2 = N\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/A\u00b2.\n\nDivide by r\u00b2 (m\u00b2):\n\nSo overall units: (N/(A\u00b2\u00b7m)) * (N\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2/A\u00b2) / m\u00b2 = (N * N\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2) / (A\u00b2\u00b7m * A\u00b2\u00b7m\u00b2) ) = N\u00b3\u00b7m\u00b2 / (A\u2074\u00b7m\u00b3) = N\u00b3/(A\u2074\u00b7m).\n\nWhich is not Newtons. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should use the standard formula and plug in the numbers correctly.\n\nWait, let's refer to the formula as per Griffiths: F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2.\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) = 10^-7 H/m.\n\nm1 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb.\n\nm2 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb.\n\nr = 0.1 m.\n\nCompute F = 10^-7 * (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4) / (0.1)^2.\n\nFirst, compute (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4):\n\n4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 = 16\u03c0\u00b2.\n\n10^-4 * 1.5 * 10^-4 = 1.5 * 10^-8.\n\nSo numerator: 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-8.\n\nMultiply by 10^-7: 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-8 * 10^-7 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-15.\n\nDivide by (0.1)^2 = 0.01: 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-15 / 0.01 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 * 1.5 * 10^-13.\n\nCompute 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 16 * 9.8696 \u2248 157.914.\n\n157.914 * 1.5 \u2248 236.87.\n\nSo F \u2248 236.87 * 10^-13 \u2248 2.3687 * 10^-11 N.\n\nBut this is a very small force, 2.37 \u00d7 10^-11 N. However, the first method gave 15 N. These are vastly different. There must be a misunderstanding in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different when using magnetic pole strengths in webers. Maybe I need to consider the difference between magnetic charge and electric charge formulas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the old unit system, like cgs units, but the question states webers, which are SI. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought. The formula for the force between two magnetic poles in SI units is indeed F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. But sometimes, magnetic pole strength is given in ampere-meters (A\u00b7m), where weber is equivalent to N\u00b7m/A. Wait, but the problem states the pole strength is in webers, so that should be correct.\n\nWait, let's check with another source. According to Wikipedia, \"Magnetic charge\" page, the force between two magnetic charges is: F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. So that's the same as Griffiths. So that formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the second method is correct, giving approximately 2.37 \u00d7 10^-11 N. But the first method gave 15 N. Why?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the first method incorrectly used the formula F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc r\u00b2), which is not the correct formula. The correct formula is F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. So the first method inverted the \u03bc\u2080 and 4\u03c0. That's where the mistake was.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be approximately 2.37 \u00d7 10^-11 N. But the options probably have 15 N as an answer. Wait, but the problem didn't give options. Wait, the user just says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the poles are 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb and 4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb, separated by 10 cm. Using the correct formula, let's compute step by step.\n\nCompute \u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) = 10^-7 H/m.\n\nCompute m1 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb.\n\nCompute m2 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb = 6\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb.\n\nCompute r = 0.1 m.\n\nSo F = 10^-7 * (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4)(6\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4) / (0.1)^2.\n\nFirst, multiply m1 and m2:\n\n4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 * 6\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 = 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-8.\n\nThen, multiply by 10^-7:\n\n24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-8 \u00d7 10^-7 = 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-15.\n\nDivide by (0.1)^2 = 0.01:\n\n24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-15 / 0.01 = 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nCompute 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 24 * 9.8696 \u2248 236.87.\n\nThus, F \u2248 236.87 \u00d7 10^-13 \u2248 2.3687 \u00d7 10^-11 N.\n\nBut this seems extremely small. Is this realistic?\n\nWait, magnetic monopoles don't actually exist, so perhaps this is a hypothetical question. But even so, the force seems very small. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, m1 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb.\n\nm2 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb = 6\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 Wb.\n\nSo m1 * m2 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 * 6\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-4 = 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-8 Wb\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by \u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) = 10^-7 H/m:\n\n10^-7 * 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-8 = 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-15.\n\nDivide by r\u00b2 = 0.01 m\u00b2:\n\n24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-15 / 0.01 = 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-13.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nBut 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u2248 236, so 236 \u00d7 10^-13 = 2.36 \u00d7 10^-11 N.\n\nBut the initial answer using the incorrect formula was 15 N. So why such a big difference?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different when using webers. Wait, perhaps the unit of pole strength in weber is different.\n\nWait, another thought. In some contexts, magnetic pole strength is given in webers, and the formula for the force is F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080 r\u00b2). Let's test this.\n\nFormula: F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080 r\u00b2).\n\nGiven \u03bc\u2080 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7.\n\nSo F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0 * 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10^-7 * r\u00b2) = (m1 m2)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * r\u00b2).\n\nCompute numerator: m1 m2 = 24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-8.\n\nDenominator: 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-7 * 0.01 = 16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9.\n\nThus, F = (24\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-8)/(16\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 10^-9) = (24/16) * (10^-8 / 10^-9) = 1.5 * 10^1 = 15 N.\n\nAh! So depending on the formula used, we get different results. The discrepancy arises from whether the formula is F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2 or F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080 r\u00b2). These are reciprocals of each other with respect to \u03bc\u2080. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, according to the correct formula from Griffiths and Wikipedia, it's F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. But when we compute that, we get a tiny force. However, if we use F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080 r\u00b2), we get 15 N. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let's check dimensions again. Let's suppose F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2.\n\n\u03bc\u2080 has units H/m = Wb/(A\u00b7m).\n\nm1 and m2 have units Wb.\n\nr has units m.\n\nThus, units of F: (Wb/(A\u00b7m)) * (Wb\u00b2)/m\u00b2 = Wb\u00b3/(A\u00b7m\u00b3).\n\nBut Wb = T\u00b7m\u00b2 = (N/(A\u00b7m))\u00b7m\u00b2 = N\u00b7m/A.\n\nThus, Wb\u00b3/(A\u00b7m\u00b3) = (N\u00b7m/A)^3 / (A\u00b7m\u00b3) = N\u00b3\u00b7m\u00b3/(A^3) / (A\u00b7m\u00b3) = N\u00b3/(A^4).\n\nWhich is not the unit of force. So this suggests that the formula F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2 is dimensionally incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if we use F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080 r\u00b2), then units:\n\nm1 m2: Wb\u00b2.\n\n\u03bc\u2080: H/m = Wb/(A\u00b7m).\n\nr\u00b2: m\u00b2.\n\nThus, units: Wb\u00b2 / ( (Wb/(A\u00b7m)) * m\u00b2 ) = Wb\u00b2 / (Wb/(A\u00b7m) * m\u00b2) = Wb\u00b2 / (Wb\u00b7m/A) ) = Wb\u00b7A/m.\n\nBut Wb = N\u00b7m/A, so substituting:\n\n(N\u00b7m/A)\u00b7A/m = N\u00b7m/A * A/m = N\u00b7m/m = N.\n\nSo this formula gives units of Newtons, which is correct. Therefore, the correct formula must be F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080 r\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the first method was correct, giving 15 N. The confusion arose because different sources present the formula differently. It seems that when pole strengths are in webers, the formula is F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080 r\u00b2), whereas when pole strengths are in ampere-meters (A\u00b7m), the formula would be F = (\u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0)) * (m1 m2)/r\u00b2. But since the problem gives pole strengths in webers, we need to use the formula that results in correct units, which is F = (m1 m2)/(4\u03c0\u03bc\u2080 r\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 15 N.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe force between the two point poles is \\boxed{15} newtons."
