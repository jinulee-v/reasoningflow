        "question": "The ________ School of jurisprudence postulates that the law is based on what is \"correct.\"",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which school of jurisprudence is associated with the idea that law is based on what is \"correct.\" Let me start by recalling the different schools of legal thought. There's Legal Positivism, Natural Law, Legal Realism, Critical Legal Studies, maybe others like Historical School or Sociological School?\n\nThe question mentions that the law is based on what is \"correct.\" Hmm. Natural Law theory often talks about law being based on morality or ethics, so what's correct in a moral sense. Legal Positivism, on the other hand, separates law from morality, saying law is about what is enacted by the state, not necessarily what's morally right. So if the question is about law being based on correctness, maybe Natural Law?\n\nWait, but the term \"correct\" here might be more about what is right or just. Natural Law would align with that because they believe laws should be based on moral principles. For example, Aquinas or Aristotle's ideas where an unjust law isn't a true law. So Natural Law school might be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another school. Let me think again. The question says \"postulates that the law is based on what is 'correct.'\" So it's about the foundation of law being correctness. If \"correct\" here is objective correctness, maybe Natural Law. But sometimes people might confuse with Legal Realism, which focuses on outcomes or social effects, but that's more about how law is applied rather than its basis.\n\nAnother angle: The term \"correct\" could be interpreted as the law being derived from logical principles or correct reasoning. Maybe Analytical Jurisprudence? Wait, but I'm not sure. Or maybe the Formalist School, which emphasizes logic and structure, but again, that's more about how laws are applied rather than their basis.\n\nWait, the question is about the basis of law itself. Natural Law says law is based on morality, so what is morally correct. Legal Positivism says law is based on social facts (like enacted rules). So if the school says law is based on what is correct (in a moral sense), then Natural Law is the answer. Let me check if there's another term. The question uses \"School of jurisprudence\" so maybe the exact term is Natural Law School. Alternatively, maybe there's a different phrasing. Let me think of other schools. The Historical School looks to tradition and historical development, so probably not. The Sociological School considers society's impact, but again, not exactly correctness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term is \"Natural Law\" but phrased differently? The question might be looking for \"Natural Law\" as the answer. Let me confirm. Yes, Natural Law theorists argue that law should be based on morality and what is right, so \"correct\" in that sense. Therefore, the answer is Natural Law School.\n</think>\n\nThe **Natural Law** School of jurisprudence postulates that the law is based on what is \"correct.\" This school emphasizes that legal systems should align with moral principles, ethical truths, or an objective standard of justice. Proponents like Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas argued that laws derive their authority not merely from their enactment by a sovereign (as in Legal Positivism) but from their conformity to an inherent, universal morality. Thus, \"correctness\" in this context refers to moral or ethical validity, such that an unjust law is not a true law."
