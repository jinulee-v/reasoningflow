        "response": "John Rawls, in his seminal work *A Theory of Justice*, argues that the people in the original position (POP) would be least likely to adopt a position that prioritizes maximizing the welfare of the best-off individuals or allows for significant inequalities that do not benefit the least advantaged. Specifically, Rawls claims that the POP would reject **utilitarianism** in its classical form, which seeks to maximize overall happiness or utility, even if it comes at the expense of the worst-off.\n\nThe POP, operating behind the veil of ignorance, would prioritize principles that ensure fairness and protect the interests of the least advantaged. Rawls' two principles of justice\u2014the principle of equal basic liberties and the difference principle\u2014reflect this concern. The difference principle, in particular, allows for social and economic inequalities only if they benefit the least well-off members of society. This stands in stark contrast to utilitarianism, which could justify sacrificing the well-being of some for the greater good of the majority.\n\nThus, Rawls argues that the POP would be least likely to adopt a utilitarian framework or any position that fails to prioritize the fair treatment of the least advantaged."
