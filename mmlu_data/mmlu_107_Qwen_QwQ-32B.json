        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which movement the passage from \u00c9mile Zola's \"Germinal\" is associated with. The question mentions that the passage shows a direct concern for the welfare of the working classes, which was typical of a certain movement. Let me start by recalling what I know about Zola and his works.\n\nFirst, Zola was a French writer, and \"Germinal\" is one of his most famous novels, part of the Rougon-Macquart series. I remember that Zola is closely associated with naturalism in literature. Naturalism focused on the effects of environment and heredity on the human condition, often depicting the harsh realities of working-class life. But the question is about a movement, not just a literary style. The passage talks about the working classes and their struggles, so maybe it's related to socialism or communism?\n\nThe passage mentions the characters discussing the idea of a new society of labor in common and criticizes the workers for not wanting to share their winnings, instead wanting to live selfishly. This seems to touch on themes of class struggle and collective versus individual gain. The character Souvarine is disillusioned because his dream of fraternity and a new society hasn't materialized. The other workers, like the hatworkers in Marseilles, are criticized for not embracing a communal lifestyle even when they had the chance.\n\nNow, thinking about movements of the 19th century that focused on the working class: socialism, communism, anarchism, maybe even utopian socialism. The mention of \"national liberation\" and the critique of the Nihilists turning to politicians might be pointing towards a more internationalist or class-based movement rather than nationalist. The idea of a \"new society of labor in common\" sounds like a socialist or communist ideal of collective ownership and communal living.\n\nZola himself was known for his social criticism. \"Germinal\" deals with the harsh conditions of coal miners and the strike they organize, which is a classic labor movement issue. The themes here align with socialist ideas where the working class should unite and overthrow capitalist structures. The criticism of the workers wanting to be bourgeois themselves instead of sharing wealth could be a critique of reformist tendencies versus revolutionary socialism.\n\nAnother angle: the passage references the workers investing their lottery winnings instead of using it for communal good. This might be a critique of individualism versus collectivism, a key point in socialist thought. The movement that emphasizes the welfare of the working class and collective ownership is socialism, particularly revolutionary socialism or Marxism. However, the question is about a movement that typically had such concerns. Since Zola was a naturalist writer, but his themes often overlapped with socialist ideas, the movement in question here is likely socialism or the socialist movement.\n\nWait, but there's also the labor movement or trade unionism. However, the passage is more about ideological concerns rather than organizational labor movements. The key here is the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes as part of a broader movement. The mention of \"fusion\" not taking place between the protagonist and the workers might refer to the failure of intellectuals and workers to unite, a theme in socialist discourse.\n\nAlternatively, the term \"movement\" could refer to literary naturalism itself, but the question specifies \"direct concern for the welfare of the working classes,\" which is more of a social/political movement. Since Zola's work is part of the naturalist movement in literature, but the concern for workers is part of the broader socialist movement. The passage's themes align with socialist ideals, so the answer is probably the Socialist movement. Alternatively, maybe the Labor movement, but I think Socialist is more accurate here.\n\nAnother thought: The text also references Nihilists and their focus on national liberation, which the character dismisses. The contrast here is between nationalist movements (like Nihilists in Russia) and a more internationalist, class-based movement. The protagonist's dream of fraternity and communal labor is more in line with socialism/communism. The critique of the workers wanting to be bourgeois themselves is a common socialist critique of reformism or class collaboration.\n\nTherefore, the movement that typically had this concern for the working class welfare and the ideals of communal labor is the Socialist movement, specifically perhaps Marxist socialism. Since the question is from an exam, maybe the expected answer is \"Socialism\" or \"Socialist movement.\" Alternatively, the term \"workers' movement\" might be considered, but I think the primary answer expected here is Socialism.\n</think>\n\nThe passage from \u00c9mile Zola's *Germinal* (1885) reflects themes central to the **Socialist movement**, particularly its focus on the welfare of the working classes and the critique of capitalist and bourgeois values. The text highlights several key socialist ideas:\n\n1. **Class Struggle and Collective Action**: The disillusionment of Souvarine with the failure of workers to unite in a \"fusion\" and build a \"new society of labour in common\" underscores the socialist ideal of collective ownership and solidarity over individualism. The critique of the Marseilles workers hoarding their lottery winnings instead of sharing them aligns with socialist critiques of greed and the need for communal resource distribution.\n\n2. **Anti-Bourgeois Sentiment**: The character\u2019s accusation that workers merely desire to replace the bourgeoisie rather than abolish class distinctions directly engages with socialist critiques of reformism and the need for revolutionary change. This reflects the tension between revolutionary socialism and more moderate or self-serving tendencies within the working class.\n\n3. **Critique of Nationalism**: The dismissal of Nihilists (Russian revolutionaries) for prioritizing \"national liberation\" over class solidarity points to the socialist emphasis on internationalism and transcending nationalist divides in favor of global class unity.\n\n4. **Naturalism and Social Critique**: While Zola\u2019s literary style is naturalist, his portrayal of the harsh realities of labor (e.g., miners\u2019 struggles) and his advocacy for social justice are deeply intertwined with socialist thought. The novel *Germinal* itself is a seminal work of socialist literature, highlighting the exploitation of workers and the need for systemic change.\n\nThus, the passage exemplifies the **Socialist movement** of the 19th century, which sought to address the plight of the working class through collective action, egalitarian principles, and the abolition of capitalist structures. The themes of fraternity, communal labor, and critique of bourgeois values are hallmarks of this movement. \n\n**Answer:** The Socialist movement."
