        "question": "A store sells 107 different colors of paint. They have 25 cans of each color in storage. The number of cans of paint the store has in storage can be found using the expression below. 107 \u00d7 25. How many cans of paint does the store have in storage?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many cans of paint the store has in storage. The problem says there are 107 different colors, and each color has 25 cans. The expression given is 107 multiplied by 25. Alright, so basically, I just need to compute 107 \u00d7 25. Let me think about the best way to do this.\n\nHmm, multiplying 107 by 25. Maybe breaking it down would help. I remember that multiplying by 25 is the same as multiplying by 100 and then dividing by 4, because 25 is a quarter of 100. Let me see if that works here. So if I take 107 and multiply by 100, that would be 10,700. Then dividing that by 4 should give me the same result as 107 \u00d7 25. Let me check that.\n\nWait, 100 divided by 4 is 25, so yeah, that makes sense. So 107 \u00d7 100 is 10,700, divided by 4 is 2,675. Let me verify that division. 10,700 divided by 4. 4 goes into 10 two times, which is 8, subtract 8 from 10, you get 2. Bring down the 7 to make 27. 4 goes into 27 six times, which is 24. Subtract 24 from 27, you have 3. Bring down the 0, making it 30. 4 goes into 30 seven times, which is 28. Subtract 28 from 30, you get 2. Bring down the 0, making it 20. 4 goes into 20 five times exactly. So that gives 2,675. Okay, so that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do the multiplication the standard way. Let me try that to cross-check. 107 \u00d7 25. Let's write it out:\n\n   107\n\u00d7  25\n-------\nFirst multiply 107 by 5. 7\u00d75 is 35, write down 5 and carry over 3. Then 0\u00d75 is 0 plus 3 is 3. Then 1\u00d75 is 5. So that gives 535.\n\nThen multiply 107 by 20 (since the 2 in 25 is in the tens place). So 107 \u00d7 20. 107 \u00d7 2 is 214, and then add a zero at the end to make it 2140.\n\nNow add the two results together: 535 + 2140. Let's see, 535 + 2000 is 2535, then plus 140 is 2675. Yep, same answer. So that's good.\n\nAnother way I can think of is using distributive property. 107 \u00d7 25 can be broken into (100 + 7) \u00d7 25. Then that's 100\u00d725 + 7\u00d725. 100\u00d725 is 2500, and 7\u00d725 is 175. Adding those together: 2500 + 175 = 2675. Yep, same result again.\n\nHmm, so all methods are pointing to 2675. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors here. Let me check the first method again. 107 \u00d7 100 is 10,700. Divided by 4: 10,700 divided by 4. 4 \u00d7 2,000 is 8,000. Subtract that from 10,700, you get 2,700. 4 \u00d7 600 is 2,400. Subtract that from 2,700, you have 300 left. 4 \u00d7 75 is 300. So total is 2,000 + 600 + 75 = 2,675. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of 25 as 20 + 5. So 107 \u00d7 (20 + 5) = 107\u00d720 + 107\u00d75. 107\u00d720 is 2,140 and 107\u00d75 is 535. Adding those gives 2,140 + 535. Let's see, 2,140 + 500 is 2,640, then +35 is 2,675. Yep, same answer again.\n\nI think that's solid. All different methods give me the same result, so I can be confident that the store has 2,675 cans of paint in storage. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Let me just do a quick estimation to check if 2,675 is reasonable. 100 colors would be 100\u00d725=2,500, and 7 more colors would add 7\u00d725=175, so total is 2,500 + 175 = 2,675. That's exactly the same as before. So that's another way to confirm.\n\nAlright, I think that's thorough. The answer should be 2,675.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe store has \\boxed{2675} cans of paint in storage.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of cans of paint the store has in storage, we need to compute the product of 107 and 25. Here are the key steps using different methods to verify the result:\n\n1. **Using the relationship between 25 and 100**:\n   \\[\n   107 \\times 25 = \\frac{107 \\times 100}{4} = \\frac{10700}{4} = 2675\n   \\]\n\n2. **Standard multiplication**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r}\n     107 \\\\\n   \\times 25 \\\\\n   \\hline\n     535 \\quad (\\text{107 \u00d7 5}) \\\\\n   +2140 \\quad (\\text{107 \u00d7 20, shifted one position to the left}) \\\\\n   \\hline\n     2675 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distributive property**:\n   \\[\n   107 \\times 25 = (100 + 7) \\times 25 = 100 \\times 25 + 7 \\times 25 = 2500 + 175 = 2675\n   \\]\n\n4. **Breaking down 25 into 20 and 5**:\n   \\[\n   107 \\times 25 = 107 \\times (20 + 5) = 107 \\times 20 + 107 \\times 5 = 2140 + 535 = 2675\n   \\]\n\nAll methods consistently yield the result 2675. Therefore, the store has \\boxed{2675} cans of paint in storage."

Here are the key steps using different methods to verify the result:\n\n1. **Using the relationship between 25 and 100**:\n   \\[\n   107 \\times 25 = \\frac{107 \\times 100}{4} = \\frac{10700}{4} = 2675\n   \\]\n\n2. **Standard multiplication**:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{r}\n     107 \\\\\n   \\times 25 \\\\\n   \\hline\n     535 \\quad (\\text{107 \u00d7 5}) \\\\\n   +2140 \\quad (\\text{107 \u00d7 20, shifted one position to the left}) \\\\\n   \\hline\n     2675 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Distributive property**:\n   \\[\n   107 \\times 25 = (100 + 7) \\times 25 = 100 \\times 25 + 7 \\times 25 = 2500 + 175 = 2675\n   \\]\n\n4. **Breaking down 25 into 20 and 5**:\n   \\[\n   107 \\times 25 = 107 \\times (20 + 5) = 107 \\times 20 + 107 \\times 5 = 2140 + 535 = 2675\n   \\]\n\nAll methods consistently yield the result 2675.
