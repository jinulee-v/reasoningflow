        "question": "A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?",
        "response": "The patient's symptoms suggest a combination of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The decreased appetite, difficulty falling asleep, sadness, and frequent crying are indicative of depression. The new onset of compulsive behaviors, such as rechecking the door lock and counting toilet paper, are characteristic of OCD.\n\nPharmacotherapy for both depression and OCD often targets the neurotransmitter serotonin. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used to treat both conditions. These medications increase the availability of serotonin in the brain, which can help alleviate symptoms of depression and reduce the frequency and intensity of obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the pharmacotherapy should be targeted to serotonin."
