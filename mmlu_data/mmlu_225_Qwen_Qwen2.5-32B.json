        "question": "Psychological egoism is:",
        "response": "Psychological egoism is the view that all human actions are motivated by self-interest. It is the view that people are always motivated by their own desires, needs, and interests, and that they act in ways that they believe will benefit them personally. This view is often contrasted with ethical egoism, which is the view that people should act in their own self-interest, regardless of whether it is in the interest of others. Psychological egoism is a descriptive theory, meaning that it is a theory about how people actually behave, rather than a normative theory, which is a theory about how people should behave."
