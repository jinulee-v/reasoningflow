        "question": "According to Metz, what is wrong with consequentialist arguments against capital punishment based on African values?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what Metz says is wrong with consequentialist arguments against capital punishment based on African values. Let me start by recalling what I know about Metz and African philosophy. Thaddeus Metz is a philosopher known for his work in African ethics, particularly Ubuntu, which emphasizes community and relationships. Consequentialist arguments judge actions based on their outcomes; so a consequentialist against capital punishment would argue that it leads to bad consequences, like more violence or doesn't deter crime.\n\nBut Metz might critique this approach from an African values perspective. Maybe he thinks that African ethics isn't purely consequentialist? Ubuntu is often about the moral quality of actions themselves, not just outcomes. So perhaps Metz argues that using consequentialist reasoning doesn't align with African values which are more about relationality and communal harmony. Maybe the problem is that focusing on consequences alone misses the intrinsic wrongness of capital punishment in African ethics, which might view it as a violation of community bonds or human dignity regardless of outcomes.\n\nI should check if Metz differentiates between Western consequentialism and African communitarian ethics. He might say that even if capital punishment had good consequences, it's still wrong because it violates Ubuntu principles like restoring relationships rather than retributing. Alternatively, he could argue that African values require a different kind of reasoning beyond just consequences, so a purely consequentialist argument against capital punishment isn't sufficient or appropriate within an African ethical framework.\n\nWait, but the question is specifically about what's wrong with consequentialist arguments against capital punishment based on African values. So Metz's critique would be that those arguments are using the wrong kind of reasoning\u2014consequentialism\u2014when African values (like Ubuntu) are not consequentialist. Therefore, such arguments don't properly engage with the African ethical perspective, which might focus on different aspects, like the inherent dignity of persons or the importance of reconciliation. So even if the argument is against capital punishment, using consequentialist reasoning isn't the right approach from an African viewpoint because it doesn't address the core ethical principles.\n\nAnother angle: Metz might argue that African values prioritize restorative justice over punitive measures. So a consequentialist argument against capital punishment might focus on deterrence or lack thereof, but the African value-based argument should focus on how capital punishment undermines community restoration and forgiveness. Therefore, using consequentialist reasoning is missing the point or not leveraging the more relevant African ethical principles.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not conflating different ideas. Let me structure this:\n\n1. Consequentialist arguments against capital punishment: argue that it doesn't deter crime, is more costly, risks innocent lives, etc.\n2. Metz's African values (Ubuntu): focus on communal relationships, dignity, restorative justice.\n3. Metz's critique: consequentialist arguments are misaligned because African ethics isn't just about consequences. Even if capital punishment had good consequences, it might still be wrong because it violates communal harmony or fails to restore relationships. Conversely, even if it had bad consequences, the African argument would be based on different grounds.\n\nTherefore, the problem is that consequentialist arguments don't tap into the deeper African ethical principles, making them inadequate or missing the real ethical issues from an African perspective. Metz would advocate for arguments rooted in Ubuntu's emphasis on community and dignity rather than consequences."
