        "question": "Suppose that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x. If f is a polynomial and f(5) = 11, then f(15/2)",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where the function f satisfies f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x, and it's given that f is a polynomial. Also, f(5) = 11, and I need to find f(15/2). Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the functional equation f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x. That means that adding 1 to the input doesn't change the output. So, the function is periodic with period 1. But wait, f is a polynomial. Polynomials are usually not periodic unless they're constant functions. Because, for example, linear functions have a constant slope, so they can't repeat values unless the slope is zero. Similarly, quadratic functions open upwards or downwards, so they don't repeat values either. So, the only polynomial that can be periodic is a constant function. Is that right?\n\nWait, let me check. Suppose f(x) is a constant function, then yes, f(1 + x) = f(x) holds. But are there any non-constant polynomials that satisfy this periodicity? Let's suppose f is a non-constant polynomial. Then, if it's periodic with period 1, it would have to repeat its values every interval of length 1. But polynomials tend to infinity or negative infinity as x approaches infinity or negative infinity, unless they're constant. So, a non-constant polynomial can't be periodic. Therefore, f must be a constant polynomial. But wait, if f is a constant function, then f(5) = 11 implies that f(x) = 11 for all x. Therefore, f(15/2) would also be 11. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something here. The problem says f is a polynomial and f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x. So, if f is a constant polynomial, then yes, it satisfies the equation. But could there be a non-constant polynomial that satisfies this? Let's suppose f is a non-constant polynomial. Then, consider f(x + 1) - f(x) = 0 for all x. Let's define g(x) = f(x + 1) - f(x). Then g(x) is identically zero. But g(x) is also a polynomial. Let's see what the degree of g(x) is. If f(x) is a polynomial of degree n, then f(x + 1) is also a polynomial of degree n, and their difference would be a polynomial of degree at most n - 1. Because the leading terms would cancel out if they have the same coefficient. Wait, but if f(x + 1) - f(x) is identically zero, then all coefficients must be zero. Let's think about that.\n\nSuppose f(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0. Then f(x + 1) = a_n (x + 1)^n + ... + a_1 (x + 1) + a_0. The difference f(x + 1) - f(x) would be a polynomial where the coefficients of x^k involve the coefficients from the expansion of (x + 1)^k - x^k. For example, the leading term would be a_n [(x + 1)^n - x^n]. Expanding (x + 1)^n - x^n using the binomial theorem, the x^n terms cancel, so the leading term is a_n [n x^{n-1} + ... + 1]. Therefore, the leading term of f(x + 1) - f(x) is a_n * n x^{n-1}. If f(x + 1) - f(x) is identically zero, then all coefficients must be zero. Therefore, the coefficient of x^{n-1} is a_n * n, which must be zero. Since n is the degree of the polynomial, n >= 1, so a_n must be zero. But that contradicts the assumption that f is a degree n polynomial. Therefore, the only solution is a_n = 0 for all n >= 1, which means f is a constant polynomial. Therefore, f must be constant. Therefore, f(x) = 11 for all x, so f(15/2) = 11. Therefore, the answer is 11. But let me check again.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different approach. Suppose we accept that f is periodic with period 1 and a polynomial. Then, as polynomials are analytic and periodic functions with period 1 can be represented by their Fourier series, but polynomials are entire functions with only polynomial growth, whereas periodic functions (unless constant) have to have some kind of oscillatory behavior, which polynomials don't have. Therefore, the only polynomial that is periodic is a constant function. Therefore, f(x) = 11 for all x, so f(15/2) = 11. Therefore, the answer is 11. But let me check again with specific examples.\n\nSuppose f(x) is a constant function, then yes, f(x + 1) = f(x). If f(x) is non-constant, say linear: f(x) = ax + b. Then f(x + 1) = a(x + 1) + b = ax + a + b. Then f(x + 1) - f(x) = a. So unless a = 0, this is not zero. So only constant functions work here. Similarly, quadratic: f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Then f(x + 1) = a(x + 1)^2 + b(x + 1) + c = a(x^2 + 2x + 1) + b(x + 1) + c = ax^2 + (2a + b)x + (a + b + c). Then f(x + 1) - f(x) = (2a + b)x + (a + b + c - c) = (2a + b)x + (a + b). For this to be zero for all x, coefficients must be zero: 2a + b = 0 and a + b = 0. Solving: from first equation, b = -2a. Substitute into second equation: a + (-2a) = -a = 0 => a = 0. Then b = 0. So f(x) = c, constant. So again, only constant functions. Similarly, for higher degrees, the same logic applies. Therefore, f must be constant. Therefore, f(5) = 11 implies f(x) = 11 everywhere. Therefore, f(15/2) = 11. So the answer is 11. Therefore, I think the answer is 11. Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, since f is periodic with period 1, then f(x + 1) = f(x) for all x. Therefore, f(x + n) = f(x) for all integers n. Therefore, f(5) = f(5 - 5*1) = f(0) = 11. Similarly, f(15/2) = f(15/2 - 7*1) = f(15/2 - 7) = f(1/2). But since f is periodic with period 1, f(1/2) = f(1/2 + n) for any integer n. But since f is a constant function, f(1/2) = 11. Therefore, f(15/2) = 11. Wait, but this approach assumes that f is constant? Or does it?\n\nWait, no. If f is periodic with period 1, then f(x + n) = f(x) for any integer n. So, f(5) = f(0) = 11. Similarly, f(15/2) = f(15/2 - 7) = f(1/2). But unless we know more about f, we can't say what f(1/2) is. However, since f is a polynomial, and we already established that the only periodic polynomial is a constant function, then f(1/2) must be 11. Therefore, f(15/2) = 11. So, combining both the periodicity and the fact that f is a polynomial, we conclude f is constant. Therefore, the answer is 11.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we didn't realize that only constant functions are periodic polynomials. Let's try to construct such a polynomial. Suppose f is periodic with period 1, so f(x + 1) = f(x). Then, for any integer n, f(x + n) = f(x). Suppose f is a polynomial of degree n. Then, as x tends to infinity, f(x) tends to infinity or negative infinity depending on the leading coefficient. However, since f is periodic, f(x + n) = f(x), so f(x) would have to repeat its values every interval of length 1. But polynomials don't do that unless they're constant. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, f must be constant. Therefore, f(15/2) = 11.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 11. Let me check once more. Suppose f is a non-constant polynomial. Then, f(x + 1) - f(x) is a non-zero polynomial. But the problem states that f(x + 1) = f(x) for all real x, so f(x + 1) - f(x) = 0 for all x. Therefore, the only way this can happen is if f is a constant polynomial. Therefore, f(x) = 11 for all x, so f(15/2) = 11. Yep, that seems solid. So, the answer is 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}"
