        "response": "The correct answer is (C) The disorder is more common in males than in females. X-linked recessive disorders are more common in males because they only have one X chromosome, so if they inherit the mutated gene, they will express the disorder. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they need to inherit two copies of the mutated gene to express the disorder. Therefore, the disorder is more common in males than in females."
