        "question": "Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III. Zero net external torque",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which conditions ensure that angular momentum is conserved. The options are I. Conservation of linear momentum, II. Zero net external force, and III. Zero net external torque. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about angular momentum conservation.\n\nFrom my physics class, I remember that angular momentum is conserved when there's no external torque acting on a system. That's similar to how linear momentum is conserved when there's no external force. So right off the bat, condition III, zero net external torque, sounds like it's directly related to angular momentum conservation. But let me not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe question is asking which of these conditions will ensure angular momentum is conserved. Let's break down each option:\n\nI. Conservation of linear momentum. Hmm, linear momentum is conserved when there's no net external force, right? So if linear momentum is conserved (condition I), that would mean the net external force is zero (which is condition II). But does the conservation of linear momentum necessarily lead to conservation of angular momentum? I'm not sure. Maybe they are related but separate conditions. For example, even if linear momentum is conserved, if there is an external torque, angular momentum might not be conserved. So maybe condition I isn't sufficient?\n\nII. Zero net external force. If the net external force is zero, then linear momentum is conserved. But angular momentum depends on torque, not force directly. Torque is the rotational analog of force, but it's also dependent on the position where the force is applied. So even if the net external force is zero, if those forces create a net torque, then angular momentum wouldn't be conserved. Wait, but if the net external force is zero, does that automatically mean the net torque is zero? Let me think. Suppose you have two equal and opposite forces acting on an object but not along the same line. That would create a torque (a couple), right? So even though the net force is zero, there is a net torque. Therefore, condition II (zero net external force) doesn't necessarily lead to zero net external torque. So angular momentum might not be conserved even if II is true. Therefore, II alone isn't sufficient.\n\nIII. Zero net external torque. As I thought earlier, angular momentum is conserved when the net external torque is zero. So condition III is definitely a requirement. So III is necessary. But the question is asking which conditions will ensure angular momentum is conserved. So if III is satisfied, then angular momentum is conserved regardless of the other conditions? Let me confirm. Angular momentum conservation is solely dependent on the net external torque. Even if there are external forces, as long as the torque they produce is zero, angular momentum is conserved. So yes, III is sufficient.\n\nBut wait, the options are I, II, III. The question is which of these conditions ensure angular momentum conservation. So maybe more than one? Let me check again.\n\nIf condition III is met (zero net external torque), then angular momentum is conserved. So III is correct. What about I and II?\n\nCondition I: Conservation of linear momentum. That happens when net external force is zero (condition II). So if linear momentum is conserved (I), that implies II is true. But as we saw earlier, II doesn't necessarily lead to III. So even if linear momentum is conserved (I), angular momentum might not be conserved if there's a net external torque. Therefore, I is not sufficient.\n\nCondition II: Zero net external force. As discussed, this leads to conservation of linear momentum, but doesn't ensure zero net torque. So II alone isn't sufficient.\n\nTherefore, only condition III ensures angular momentum conservation. So the answer should be III.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose there is a system where both linear and angular momentum are conserved. Then, maybe if linear momentum is conserved (I), does that have any bearing on angular momentum? But no, because linear momentum conservation (I) is due to zero net external force (II), which doesn't affect torque. So even if I is true, angular momentum isn't necessarily conserved. So only III is required.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is III. So among the options given, only III ensures angular momentum conservation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{III}"
