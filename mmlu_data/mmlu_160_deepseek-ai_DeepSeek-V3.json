However, statistically, **older adults** (particularly those aged 65 and above) are more likely to remain at home alone due to factors like retirement, health issues, or the loss of a spouse. Additionally, individuals with disabilities or chronic illnesses may also be more likely to stay home alone. \n\nIf you have specific individuals or scenarios in mind, feel free to provide more details for a more tailored response!"
