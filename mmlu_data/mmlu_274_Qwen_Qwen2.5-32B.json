        "response": "Donald Trump attacked globalization in the 2016 campaign by blaming it for the loss of American jobs and the decline of the manufacturing sector. He argued that globalization had led to the outsourcing of jobs to other countries, particularly China, and that this had hurt the American economy and working class. He also criticized free trade agreements, such as NAFTA, for being unfair to American workers and businesses. Trump promised to renegotiate or withdraw from these agreements and to impose tariffs on imports to protect American industries and jobs."
