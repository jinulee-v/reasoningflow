        "question": "Holding all else equal which of the following monetary policies would be used to boost U.S. exports?",
        "response": "To boost U.S. exports, the Federal Reserve (the central bank of the United States) would typically implement an **expansionary monetary policy** that weakens the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. A weaker dollar makes U.S. goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers, thereby increasing demand for exports. Here are the specific monetary policies that could achieve this:\n\n1. **Lowering Interest Rates**:  \n   - Reducing the federal funds rate makes borrowing cheaper, which can stimulate domestic economic activity.  \n   - Lower interest rates also reduce the return on U.S. assets, making them less attractive to foreign investors. This decreases demand for the U.S. dollar, causing it to depreciate.\n\n2. **Quantitative Easing (QE)**:  \n   - The Fed purchases long-term securities (like government bonds) to increase the money supply and lower long-term interest rates.  \n   - This can lead to a depreciation of the U.S. dollar, making exports more competitive.\n\n3. **Forward Guidance Signaling Lower Rates**:  \n   - The Fed can communicate its intention to keep interest rates low for an extended period.  \n   - This can reduce demand for the U.S. dollar, as investors anticipate lower returns on dollar-denominated assets.\n\n4. **Currency Intervention**:  \n   - The Fed could directly intervene in foreign exchange markets by selling U.S. dollars and buying foreign currencies to weaken the dollar.  \n   - This is less common but can be used in extreme cases.\n\nIn summary, **lowering interest rates** or implementing **quantitative easing** are the most likely monetary policies to boost U.S. exports by weakening the dollar, all else being equal."
