        "question": "A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how much work is required to move a charge of +8 \u00b5C from the point (0, 4 meters) to (3 meters, 0), where there's another charge of +1 mC fixed at the origin. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about electric potential and work done on charges.\n\nFirst, work done in moving a charge in an electric field is related to the change in electric potential energy. The formula I remember is that the work done (W) is equal to the charge multiplied by the change in electric potential (\u0394V), right? So W = q\u0394V. But wait, is that the case when moving a charge against or with the electric field? Let me think. Oh, right, if the charge is moved in the field without acceleration, the work done by the external force is equal to the change in potential energy. So maybe I need to calculate the potential energy difference between the two points.\n\nElectric potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by U = k * (Q1 * Q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, Q1 and Q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. So, since the charge Q = +1 mC is fixed at the origin, the other charge Q = +8 \u00b5C will have potential energy due to this fixed charge. Therefore, the work done should be the difference in potential energy between the initial and final positions.\n\nLet me write that down. The initial position is (0,4), so the distance from the origin (where the 1 mC charge is) is 4 meters. The final position is (3,0), so the distance from the origin is 3 meters. Therefore, the initial potential energy (U_initial) is k * (1 mC * 8 \u00b5C) / 4 meters, and the final potential energy (U_final) is k * (1 mC * 8 \u00b5C) / 3 meters. Then the work done would be U_final - U_initial. Wait, but since we're moving the charge closer, and both charges are positive, the potential energy increases because we're doing work against the repulsion. So the work done should be positive. But let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, electric potential (V) at a point due to a charge Q is V = k * Q / r. So the potential at the initial point (0,4) is V_initial = k * (1 mC) / 4, and at the final point (3,0) is V_final = k * (1 mC) / 3. Then the work done is the charge being moved (8 \u00b5C) multiplied by the potential difference (V_final - V_initial). So W = q * (V_final - V_initial). That should give the same result as calculating the potential energy difference. Let me check.\n\nYes, because potential energy U = q * V, so \u0394U = q * \u0394V, which is the same as W = q * \u0394V. So either way, whether I compute the potential energy difference directly or compute the potential difference and multiply by the charge, I should get the same answer. Good.\n\nSo let's proceed with the calculation. First, convert all units to standard ones. The charges are given in milliCoulombs and microCoulombs. Let me convert them to Coulombs.\n\n1 mC = 1e-3 C, so Q1 = +1e-3 C.\n\n8 \u00b5C = 8e-6 C, so Q2 = +8e-6 C.\n\nDistances: initial distance r_initial = 4 meters, final distance r_final = 3 meters.\n\nCoulomb's constant k is 8.988e9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2.\n\nFirst, calculate the electric potential at the initial point:\n\nV_initial = k * Q1 / r_initial = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 / 4\n\nSimilarly, V_final = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 / 3\n\nThen, the potential difference \u0394V = V_final - V_initial = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 (1/3 - 1/4)\n\nCompute that:\n\n1/3 - 1/4 = (4 - 3)/12 = 1/12\n\nSo \u0394V = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 * (1/12) = 8.988e6 * (1/12) \u2248 749,000 volts? Wait, that seems high. Let me check.\n\nWait, 8.988e9 * 1e-3 is 8.988e6. Then 8.988e6 divided by 12 is approximately 749,000. So \u0394V \u2248 749,000 V. Then multiply by Q2 = 8e-6 C to get the work done.\n\nSo W = 8e-6 C * 749,000 V \u2248 8e-6 * 7.49e5 \u2248 5.992 Joules. Approximately 6 Joules? Hmm, that seems plausible?\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again step by step.\n\nFirst, Q1 = 1e-3 C.\n\nV_initial = k * Q1 / r_initial = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 / 4 = (8.988e9 / 4) * 1e-3 = 2.247e9 * 1e-3 = 2.247e6 volts.\n\nSimilarly, V_final = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 / 3 = (8.988e9 / 3) * 1e-3 \u2248 2.996e9 * 1e-3 = 2.996e6 volts.\n\nTherefore, \u0394V = V_final - V_initial \u2248 2.996e6 - 2.247e6 = 0.749e6 volts = 749,000 volts. So that's correct.\n\nThen W = Q2 * \u0394V = 8e-6 C * 749,000 V = 8e-6 * 7.49e5 = (8 * 7.49) * 1e-1 = 59.92 * 0.1 = 5.992 Joules. So approximately 6 Joules. So rounding, maybe 6.0 Joules.\n\nBut let me check if the sign makes sense. Since both charges are positive, moving the charge closer requires work to be done against the repulsion, so the work done should be positive. And since the potential increases as you get closer to a positive charge, moving from 4 meters to 3 meters would mean moving to a higher potential, so \u0394V is positive, and since the charge is positive, W = q\u0394V is positive. So that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, using potential energy:\n\nU_initial = k * Q1 * Q2 / r_initial = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 * 8e-6 / 4\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, multiply 8.988e9 * 1e-3 = 8.988e6\n\nThen multiply by 8e-6: 8.988e6 * 8e-6 = 71.904\n\nDivide by 4: 71.904 / 4 = 17.976 Joules\n\nSimilarly, U_final = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 * 8e-6 / 3\n\nSame steps:\n\n8.988e9 * 1e-3 = 8.988e6\n\n8.988e6 * 8e-6 = 71.904\n\nDivide by 3: 71.904 / 3 \u2248 23.968 Joules\n\nTherefore, \u0394U = U_final - U_initial \u2248 23.968 - 17.976 \u2248 5.992 Joules. Same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the work required is approximately 5.992 Joules, which is about 6.0 Joules. So the answer should be 6.0 Joules. But let me check if there's any chance I messed up the exponents.\n\nWait, let's verify the exponents again:\n\nk = 8.988e9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2\n\nQ1 = 1e-3 C\n\nQ2 = 8e-6 C\n\nr_initial = 4 m\n\nr_final = 3 m\n\nCalculating U_initial:\n\nk * Q1 * Q2 / r_initial = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 * 8e-6 / 4\n\nMultiply 8.988e9 * 1e-3 = 8.988e6\n\nMultiply by 8e-6: 8.988e6 * 8e-6 = 8.988 * 8 = 71.904, and 1e6 * 1e-6 = 1e0 = 1, so total 71.904 J? Wait, no. Wait, 8.988e6 * 8e-6 = (8.988 * 8) * (1e6 * 1e-6) = 71.904 * 1 = 71.904. Then divide by 4: 71.904 / 4 = 17.976 Joules. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, U_final = 71.904 / 3 \u2248 23.968 Joules. Difference is 5.992 Joules. So yes, same as before.\n\nTherefore, the work done is approximately 6 Joules.\n\nBut let me check if the question is asking for the work done by the electric field or the work done by an external force. Because sometimes, the work done by the electric field is negative of the work done by the external force. But in the question, it says \"How much work is required to move a charge...\" which implies the work done by an external agent, which would be equal to the change in potential energy. So yes, positive 6 Joules.\n\nAlternatively, if the charge was moving in the direction of the electric field, the work done by the field would be positive, and the work done by an external force would be negative. But in this case, since we're moving the charge against the electric field (because both charges are positive, so the electric field from the origin charge repels the other charge), the work done by the external force is positive.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 6 Joules. Let me just check if I converted the units correctly.\n\nQ1 is 1 mC = 1e-3 C. Correct.\n\nQ2 is 8 \u00b5C = 8e-6 C. Correct.\n\nDistances: 4 meters and 3 meters. Correct.\n\nYes, all units are in SI units. Coulomb's constant is in N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2, so when multiplied by charges in Coulombs and divided by meters, the potential energy is in Joules. Correct.\n\nSo I think that's solid. The answer is approximately 6.0 Joules. Since the calculation gives 5.992, which is very close to 6.0, so rounding to two significant figures, maybe 6.0 J. But let's check the significant figures.\n\nOriginal data:\n\nQ1 = +1 mC: 1 significant figure?\n\nBut often, in such problems, unless specified, sometimes they consider 1 mC as 1.00 mC, but here it's written as 1 mC. Similarly, 8 \u00b5C is 8.0 \u00b5C? Hmm. The coordinates are given as 0,4 meters and 3 meters,0. So the distances are 4.0 meters and 3.0 meters, which are two significant figures each. So maybe the answer should have two significant figures. Then 5.992 Joules rounds to 6.0 Joules. So 6.0 J with two sig figs.\n\nAlternatively, if Q1 is 1 mC (1 significant figure) and Q2 is 8 \u00b5C (1 significant figure), then the answer should have 1 significant figure, which would be 6 Joules. But the distances are 4 and 3 meters, which are one significant figure each? Wait, 4 meters is one sig fig? If it's written as 4 meters, yes, but in coordinate points, sometimes it's assumed that trailing zeros are significant if there's a decimal, but since there's no decimal, 4 is one sig fig, 3 is one sig fig. Wait, but maybe in the context of the problem, they are exact values. For example, coordinates might be considered exact, so distances would be exact numbers. In that case, the significant figures would be determined by the charges. Q1 is 1 mC (1 sig fig), Q2 is 8 \u00b5C (1 sig fig). So the answer would have 1 sig fig, so 6 Joules. But sometimes, in textbook problems, even if numbers are given without decimals, they might be considered as having more sig figs. Hmm. But given the problem statement, it's safest to go with two sig figs because the distances are 4 and 3 meters, which could be two sig figs if, for example, 4.0 and 3.0. But since they are written as 4 and 3, maybe one sig fig. Hmm. But in most cases, unless specified, distances like 4 meters are considered to have infinite sig figs because they are measurements. Wait, no. If someone writes 4 meters, it's usually considered one sig fig unless a decimal is present. So if it's 4.0 meters, that's two sig figs. So in this problem, since it's written as 4 meters and 3 meters, they have one sig fig each. Charges are 1 mC (1 sig fig) and 8 \u00b5C (1 sig fig). So the least number of sig figs is 1, so the answer should be 6 Joules (1 sig fig). But my calculation gave 5.992, which is approximately 6.0. So if I write 6 Joules, that's one sig fig. If I write 6.0 Joules, that's two sig figs. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's see. Coulomb's constant is given as 8.988e9, which is four sig figs. But since the charges and distances have fewer sig figs, the result should be rounded to the least number of sig figs, which is 1. But in reality, in such problems, sometimes they expect the answer to two decimal places or something. Wait, but given that the charges are 1 and 8, which are one sig fig each, and distances 4 and 3, which are one sig fig each, then yes, the answer should be one sig fig. So 6 Joules. But maybe the problem expects more precision. Let me check.\n\nWait, 1 mC is 1.00 x 10^-3 C? If the problem is from a textbook, sometimes they write 1 mC as exact, but probably not. Similarly, 8 \u00b5C is 8.00 x 10^-6 C? If so, then three sig figs. But since it's written as 1 mC and 8 \u00b5C, maybe they are exact? Wait, no. Charges are given with certain significant figures. If it's 1 mC, that's one sig fig. 8 \u00b5C is one sig fig. Distances: 4 meters (one sig fig), 3 meters (one sig fig). So all the given values have one sig fig. Therefore, the answer should have one sig fig. So 6 Joules. But in my calculation, it's 5.992, which is approximately 6.0, but since we need one sig fig, it's 6 Joules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the coordinates are exact, so 4.000... meters and 3.000... meters, making them infinitely precise, so the sig figs are determined by the charges. Q1 is 1 mC (1 sig fig), Q2 is 8 \u00b5C (1 sig fig). So still, the answer should have one sig fig. Therefore, 6 Joules.\n\nBut let me check with exact calculation:\n\nUsing k = 8.988e9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2,\n\nQ1 = 1e-3 C,\n\nQ2 = 8e-6 C,\n\nr_initial = 4 m,\n\nr_final = 3 m.\n\n\u0394U = k Q1 Q2 (1/r_final - 1/r_initial)\n\nCompute 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12 \u2248 0.083333...\n\n\u0394U = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 * 8e-6 * (1/12)\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n8.988e9 * 1e-3 = 8.988e6\n\n8.988e6 * 8e-6 = 71.904\n\n71.904 * (1/12) \u2248 5.992 J\n\nSo exactly, 5.992 J, which is approximately 6.0 J. So with two sig figs, it's 6.0 J. But given that all the given values have one sig fig, the answer should be 6 J. Hmm. But maybe in the context of the problem, they expect two decimal places or something else. Wait, but the problem didn't specify. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the answer is an exact number with the given data. Let me check with k approximated as 9e9 for simplicity.\n\nIf k = 9e9,\n\n\u0394U = 9e9 * 1e-3 * 8e-6 * (1/3 - 1/4) = 9e9 * 8e-9 * (1/12) = (9*8) * (1e9 * 1e-9) * (1/12) = 72 * 1 * (1/12) = 6 Joules. Exactly. So if we approximate k as 9e9, we get exactly 6 Joules. Therefore, the answer is 6 Joules. So maybe the problem expects that, considering k as approximately 9e9. But since I used the precise value of k, I got 5.992, which is very close to 6. So depending on the problem's expectation, it's either 6 J or 5.99 J. But given that in most textbooks, Coulomb's constant is approximated as 9e9 for simplicity, leading to an exact 6 J, perhaps the answer is 6 J. So I think the answer is \\boxed{6 \\text{ J}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe work required is \\boxed{6 \\text{ J}}."
