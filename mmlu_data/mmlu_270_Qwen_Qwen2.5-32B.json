        "question": "How did the 2008 financial crisis affect America's international reputation?",
        "response": "The 2008 financial crisis had a significant impact on America's international reputation. The crisis, which was triggered by the collapse of the housing market and the subprime mortgage industry, led to a global economic downturn. The United States, as the world's largest economy, was seen as the epicenter of the crisis, and its reputation suffered as a result. The crisis exposed weaknesses in the U.S. financial system and regulatory framework, leading to criticism from other countries and international organizations. The U.S. government's response to the crisis, including the bailout of major financial institutions, was also controversial and drew criticism from some quarters. Overall, the 2008 financial crisis damaged America's reputation as a stable and reliable economic power, and it took several years for the country to recover its standing in the global economy."
