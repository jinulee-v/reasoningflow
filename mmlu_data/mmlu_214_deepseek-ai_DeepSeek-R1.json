        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out why Baron says that the versions of the ticking bomb hypothetical she discusses are \"stunningly stupid,\" but she claims this is evidence of something. Let me start by recalling what the ticking bomb hypothetical is. It's a thought experiment often used in ethics debates, especially about torture. The scenario is that a bomb is about to explode, and the only way to prevent it is by torturing someone who knows where it is. Proponents argue this justifies torture in extreme cases.\n\nNow, Baron calls these versions \"stunningly stupid.\" That's a strong phrase. Why would she say that? Maybe because the hypothetical oversimplifies real-world situations? Or perhaps it's based on unrealistic assumptions? For example, in reality, getting accurate information through torture is questionable, or the time frame is too tight. So, if the hypothetical is unrealistic, using it to justify torture is flawed.\n\nBut she says this is actually evidence of something. Evidence of what? Maybe evidence that the argument for torture is weak? If the best examples supporters can come up with are these unrealistic, \"stupid\" scenarios, then their entire argument lacks solid foundation. So, pointing out the flaws in these hypotheticals undermines the pro-torture stance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's arguing that the reliance on such implausible scenarios reveals a deeper issue, like a moral or logical desperation. If you have to resort to extreme, unlikely examples to justify an action, it suggests there's no valid justification in more realistic cases. Therefore, the stupidity of the examples serves as evidence against the legitimacy of torture as a policy.\n\nI should also consider the context of Baron's work. If she's against torture, then her critique of these hypotheticals would be part of her argument against its use. By showing that even the best-case scenarios for torture are flawed, she's demonstrating that there's no ethical basis for it. The \"stupidity\" of the examples highlights their lack of real-world applicability, thus serving as evidence that torture cannot be justified even in theory.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the hypotheticals are structured in a way that they force a binary choice\u2014torture or disaster\u2014but real-life situations are more complex. By oversimplifying, these scenarios ignore the broader consequences, like the normalization of torture or the potential for abuse. So, Baron might be saying that the very fact that these scenarios are so simplistic and unrealistic is evidence that proponents are ignoring the complexities and real-world implications, thereby weakening their argument.\n\nIn summary, Baron's point is likely that the ticking bomb hypotheticals are so unrealistic and poorly constructed that their use in debates actually undermines the pro-torture position. Their \"stupidity\" serves as evidence that there are no sound, realistic arguments in favor of torture, and thus torture cannot be ethically justified."
