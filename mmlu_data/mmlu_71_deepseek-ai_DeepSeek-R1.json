        "question": "In a 2 pole lap winding dc machine , the resistance of one conductor is 2\u03a9 and total number of conductors is 100. Find the total resistance",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the total resistance of a 2-pole lap winding DC machine. The resistance of one conductor is 2 ohms, and there are 100 conductors in total. Hmm, let me think about how lap windings work in DC machines. \n\nFirst, I remember that lap windings have the number of parallel paths equal to the number of poles. Since this is a 2-pole machine, there should be 2 parallel paths. Each path consists of multiple conductors connected in series. Wait, but how does the total number of conductors divide into these parallel paths?\n\nIf there are 100 conductors and 2 parallel paths, then each path would have 100 divided by 2, which is 50 conductors per path. But each conductor has a resistance of 2 ohms. So, if they're in series, the resistance per path would be 50 conductors multiplied by 2 ohms. Let me check that.\n\nResistance per path = number of conductors per path \u00d7 resistance per conductor. So that's 50 \u00d7 2 = 100 ohms per path. Then, since these two paths are in parallel, the total resistance would be the resistance of one path divided by the number of paths. So, 100 ohms divided by 2 paths equals 50 ohms total resistance. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Lap winding: number of parallel paths equals the number of poles. So yes, 2 poles mean 2 parallel paths. Conductors per path is total conductors divided by the number of paths. So 100/2 = 50. Each conductor 2 ohms, so each path is 50\u00d72 = 100 ohms. Then parallel resistance is 100||100, which is 50 ohms. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the entire winding. All conductors are part of either one path or the other. Since they're in parallel, the equivalent resistance is half of one path's resistance. Yeah, that makes sense. So total resistance is 50 ohms. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. Let me just verify with the formula for lap winding resistance. The formula for armature resistance in a lap wound machine is (resistance of one conductor \u00d7 total number of conductors) divided by (number of parallel paths squared). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. If each path has (Z/2) conductors, where Z is total conductors, then resistance per path is (Z/2) \u00d7 2 ohms. Then total resistance is (resistance per path) divided by number of paths. So [(Z/2) \u00d7 r] / P, where P is number of poles. So substituting, [(100/2) \u00d7 2] / 2 = (50 \u00d7 2)/2 = 100/2 = 50 ohms. Yep, same result. \n\nAlternatively, another formula I've heard is that the total armature resistance is equal to (resistance per conductor \u00d7 number of conductors) divided by (number of parallel paths squared). Wait, let's see: resistance per conductor is 2 ohms, number of conductors is 100, number of parallel paths is 2. So (2 \u00d7 100)/(2^2) = 200/4 = 50 ohms. That also gives 50 ohms. So that formula works too. \n\nSo regardless of the approach, the total resistance comes out to 50 ohms. Therefore, I think the answer is 50 ohms. \n\nJust to recap: Lap winding, 2 poles, so 2 parallel paths. Each path has 100/2 = 50 conductors. Each conductor 2 ohms, so each path is 50\u00d72 = 100 ohms. Two 100 ohm paths in parallel: 100/2 = 50 ohms total. Yep, that checks out. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was remembering that in lap windings, the number of parallel paths equals the number of poles. If it were a wave winding, the number of parallel paths would be 2 regardless of the number of poles, but since it's lap, it's poles equal to paths. So with 2 poles, 2 paths. Then dividing the conductors accordingly. \n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire armature's resistance is the combination of all the conductors. If they're arranged in parallel paths, the total resistance is less. Since each path has more resistance, but they're in parallel, so the total is lower. \n\nSo yeah, 50 ohms seems correct. I think that's the answer."
