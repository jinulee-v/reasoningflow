        "question": "For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out for which thermodynamic process the increase in internal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the heat added to the gas. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic thermodynamics concepts. \n\nFirst, the first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy (\u0394U) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W). So, \u0394U = Q - W. The question is asking for which process \u0394U equals Q, which would imply that W, the work done, is zero. So, if work done is zero, then \u0394U = Q. That makes sense. \n\nNow, when is the work done by the gas zero? Work done by the gas is given by W = P\u0394V, where P is pressure and \u0394V is the change in volume. So, if the volume doesn't change, \u0394V is zero, which means W is zero. Therefore, a process where the volume remains constant (isochoric process) would result in no work done, so \u0394U = Q. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something here. Let me think again. The first law is \u0394U = Q - W. If the process is such that W = 0, then indeed \u0394U = Q. So, in a constant volume process, since the gas can't expand or compress, no work is done. Therefore, all the heat added goes into the internal energy. \n\nBut let me check other processes too. For example, in an isothermal process, the temperature remains constant. For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature, so \u0394U would be zero. Therefore, Q = W. So, in that case, the heat added is equal to the work done, not the internal energy change. So that's different. \n\nWhat about adiabatic processes? In an adiabatic process, Q = 0, so \u0394U = -W. So, the change in internal energy is equal to the negative of the work done. So that's not the case we're looking for either. \n\nHow about isobaric processes? In a constant pressure process, work is done because the volume changes. So, W = P\u0394V, which is non-zero. Therefore, \u0394U = Q - W, so Q would be greater than \u0394U here. So, the heat added is partly used for increasing internal energy and partly for doing work. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the only process where the work done is zero is the isochoric process (constant volume). Therefore, in that case, the heat added all goes into internal energy. \n\nWait, but let me also recall that for an ideal gas, the internal energy is a function of temperature only. So, if the temperature changes, internal energy changes. So, in a constant volume process, adding heat will increase the temperature, hence internal energy. In a constant pressure process, adding heat increases temperature (so internal energy) and also does work. \n\nAnother way to think about it: For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat at constant volume (Cv) relates the heat added at constant volume to the temperature change: Q = nCv\u0394T. And the change in internal energy is \u0394U = nCv\u0394T, regardless of the process. Wait, but if that's the case, then \u0394U is always nCv\u0394T, but Q depends on the process. So, in a constant volume process, Q = nCv\u0394T, which equals \u0394U. In other processes, Q would be different. For example, in a constant pressure process, Q = nCp\u0394T, which is greater than nCv\u0394T, so Q is greater than \u0394U. \n\nTherefore, only in constant volume process does Q equal \u0394U. So, the answer should be a constant volume (isochoric) process. \n\nBut let me check if there are any other processes where this might be true. Suppose we have a process where work done is zero not because volume is constant, but maybe because pressure is zero? But pressure can't be zero in a gas, unless it's a vacuum, which isn't the case here. So, the only way for work to be zero is if volume doesn't change. \n\nAlternatively, if the process is cyclic, where the system returns to its initial state. In that case, \u0394U would be zero, and Q = W. But the question is about the increase in internal energy being equal to heat added, so cyclic processes are out since \u0394U is zero. \n\nTherefore, confirming again, the process must be isochoric. \n\nWait, but let me also think about the mathematical expressions. For an ideal gas, \u0394U = nCv\u0394T. Heat added Q depends on the process. For constant volume, Qv = nCv\u0394T. For constant pressure, Qp = nCp\u0394T. For isothermal, Q = nRT ln(V2/V1). For adiabatic, Q = 0. \n\nSo, only in constant volume does Q equal \u0394U. Therefore, the answer is a constant volume process. \n\nI think that's solid. No other process would have Q = \u0394U because in other processes, some heat goes into work. So, yeah, isochoric process. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the heat added to the gas during a \\boxed{\\text{constant volume}} process."
