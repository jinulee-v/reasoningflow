        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I asked for a cigarette from the guy outside the store. Scenario 2 | When the security guard left his post, I pocketed a rare coin.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these two scenarios involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US standards in 2020. Let me start by breaking down each scenario.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I asked for a cigarette from the guy outside the store.\" Hmm, asking for a cigarette. Well, asking isn't necessarily wrong. But wait, maybe there's more context here. If the person is underage, then buying or receiving cigarettes would be illegal. But the scenario just says \"asked for.\" So maybe the act of asking isn't the issue. But in the US, selling cigarettes to minors is illegal, but asking isn't a crime. However, morally, if someone is underage, maybe it's considered wrong to ask? Or is it just the seller's responsibility? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the guy outside the store is a stranger, and there's no indication of coercion or anything else. So just asking for a cigarette might not be morally wrong. Unless there's some other factor, like the person is taking advantage of someone, but the scenario doesn't say that. So maybe Scenario 1 isn't clearly wrong.\n\nNow Scenario 2: \"When the security guard left his post, I pocketed a rare coin.\" Okay, so when the security guard isn't there, the person takes a rare coin. That sounds like theft. Taking something that doesn't belong to you without permission is stealing, which is both illegal and morally wrong. Even if the security guard wasn't there, the coin probably belongs to the store or someone else. So pocketing it without permission is stealing. That's clearly morally wrong. \n\nWait, but maybe the rare coin was in a public place? Like, if it was just lying around, maybe someone could argue it's finders keepers? But the scenario says \"pocketed a rare coin,\" which implies it's something that's supposed to be secured, especially since the security guard's post was being left. So the person took advantage of the guard's absence to steal. That's definitely wrong.\n\nSo comparing the two, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong because it's theft. Scenario 1 is just asking for a cigarette, which unless there's more context (like the person is underage and the seller is complicit), isn't morally wrong. So the answer should be Scenario 2.\n</think>\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, **Scenario 2** clearly involves morally wrong behavior. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Scenario 1**: \"I asked for a cigarette from the guy outside the store.\"  \n- **Analysis**: Asking for a cigarette is not inherently morally wrong. However, if the requester is underage, the act of *obtaining* cigarettes would violate legal standards (since purchasing/selling to minors is illegal). But the scenario only mentions *asking*, which is neutral. Without additional context (e.g., coercion, exploitation, or underage involvement), this action is not clearly morally wrong.  \n\n### **Scenario 2**: \"When the security guard left his post, I pocketed a rare coin.\"  \n- **Analysis**: Taking a rare coin that does not belong to you\u2014especially when the security guard\u2019s absence creates an opportunity\u2014is **theft**. Stealing is both illegal and widely regarded as morally wrong under ordinary US standards. The action demonstrates intent to deprive someone else of their property without consent, which is a clear moral violation.  \n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nScenario 2 involves a morally wrong act (theft), while Scenario 1 does not, barring additional context about age or coercion. The answer is **Scenario 2**."
