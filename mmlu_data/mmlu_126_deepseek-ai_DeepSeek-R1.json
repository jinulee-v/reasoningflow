        "question": "Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many years it will take for $300 to grow to $9600 at the same interest rate where $5000 doubles in six years when compounded annually. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions that $5000 compounded annually at x% interest rate takes six years to double. So, I can use the compound interest formula here. The formula for compound interest is:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^t\n\nWhere:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after t years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn the first scenario, the principal (P) is $5000, and it doubles to $10,000 in six years. So, A = $10,000, P = $5000, t = 6 years. We need to find the interest rate x% (which is r in decimal form).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n10,000 = 5,000(1 + r)^6\n\nDivide both sides by 5,000:\n\n2 = (1 + r)^6\n\nNow, to solve for r, I can take the sixth root of both sides. Alternatively, take the natural logarithm of both sides. Let me try taking the sixth root first.\n\n(2)^(1/6) = 1 + r\n\nCalculating 2^(1/6). Let me recall that 2^(1/6) is the same as the sixth root of 2. I know that 2^10 is 1024, so maybe logarithms would help here? Wait, maybe I can use logarithms.\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(2) = 6 * ln(1 + r)\n\nSo, ln(1 + r) = ln(2)/6\n\nThen, 1 + r = e^(ln(2)/6) = 2^(1/6)\n\nSo, r = 2^(1/6) - 1\n\nHmm, okay. Let me compute that value. Let's see, 2^(1/6) is approximately equal to... Well, 2^(1/6) is the same as the sixth root of 2. I know that 2^(1/2) is about 1.414, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 2^(1/6) should be around 1.1225 maybe? Let me check with a calculator.\n\nWait, since I don't have a calculator here, maybe approximate it. Let's recall that ln(2) \u2248 0.6931. So, ln(2)/6 \u2248 0.6931/6 \u2248 0.1155. Then, e^0.1155 \u2248 1 + 0.1155 + (0.1155)^2/2 + (0.1155)^3/6 \u2248 1.1225. So, r \u2248 0.1225, or 12.25% per annum. Let me verify that. If we compute (1.1225)^6, does it equal approximately 2?\n\nLet's compute 1.1225 squared: 1.1225 * 1.1225 \u2248 1.260. Then, 1.260 squared is \u2248 1.5876. Then, 1.5876 * 1.1225 \u2248 1.5876*1 + 1.5876*0.1225 \u2248 1.5876 + 0.1945 \u2248 1.7821. Then, 1.7821 * 1.1225 \u2248 1.7821 + 1.7821*0.1225 \u2248 1.7821 + 0.2183 \u2248 2.0004. Wow, that's pretty close! So, 1.1225^6 \u2248 2.0004, which is very close to 2. So, the interest rate is approximately 12.25% per year.\n\nAlternatively, maybe exact value? Since 2^(1/6) is the exact value. But for practical purposes, 12.25% is a good approximation.\n\nSo, we have the interest rate r \u2248 12.25%.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the problem: At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $300 to grow to $9600?\n\nAgain, using the compound interest formula:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^t\n\nHere, A = $9600, P = $300, r = 0.1225 (approx), and we need to find t.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n9600 = 300(1 + 0.1225)^t\n\nDivide both sides by 300:\n\n9600 / 300 = (1.1225)^t\n\n9600 divided by 300 is 32. So:\n\n32 = (1.1225)^t\n\nNow, we need to solve for t. Again, using logarithms.\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\nln(32) = t * ln(1.1225)\n\nTherefore, t = ln(32) / ln(1.1225)\n\nFirst, compute ln(32). Since 32 is 2^5, ln(32) = ln(2^5) = 5*ln(2) \u2248 5*0.6931 \u2248 3.4655.\n\nNext, compute ln(1.1225). Earlier, we found that ln(1.1225) \u2248 0.1155 (since we had approximated e^0.1155 \u2248 1.1225). Let me confirm:\n\nln(1.1225) \u2248 0.1155. Let's check with a calculator. If 1.1225 \u2248 e^0.1155, then ln(1.1225) \u2248 0.1155. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, t \u2248 3.4655 / 0.1155 \u2248 30.0 years approximately.\n\nWait, 3.4655 divided by 0.1155. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n3.4655 / 0.1155 \u2248 3.4655 / 0.1155 \u2248 30.005. So, approximately 30 years.\n\nBut let me check if this is correct. Let's verify if $300 at 12.25% annual interest compounded annually for 30 years becomes $9600.\n\nCompute 300*(1.1225)^30.\n\nFirst, note that (1.1225)^6 \u2248 2, as per the original problem. So, every 6 years, the amount doubles. So, in 6 years: 300 -> 600, 12 years: 1200, 18 years: 2400, 24 years: 4800, 30 years: 9600. Oh! Wait, that's exactly 5 doubling periods. Since each doubling period is 6 years, 5 doubling periods would be 30 years. So, that matches. Therefore, the answer is 30 years.\n\nBut let me check with the exact interest rate. Wait, if the exact interest rate is 2^(1/6) - 1, which is approximately 0.1225, but let's see if using the exact rate would also give us 30 years.\n\nSo, if we use r = 2^(1/6) - 1 \u2248 0.1225, then (1 + r) = 2^(1/6). Therefore, (1 + r)^t = 2^(t/6). So, in the second problem, we have:\n\n32 = 2^(t/6)\n\nBecause 32 is 2^5. Therefore:\n\n2^5 = 2^(t/6)\n\nTherefore, 5 = t/6 => t = 30. So, exactly 30 years. So, even if we use the exact rate, we get t = 30. Therefore, the answer is 30 years.\n\nTherefore, regardless of approximating the interest rate, since the first problem's doubling time is 6 years, and the second problem requires 5 doublings (since 300 to 9600 is multiplying by 32, which is 2^5), each doubling taking 6 years, so total time is 5*6 = 30 years.\n\nThat's a much simpler way to think about it! Instead of calculating the exact interest rate and then plugging back in, recognizing that each doubling period is 6 years, and since 300 needs to grow by a factor of 32 (which is 2^5), it would take 5 doubling periods, hence 5*6=30 years.\n\nSo, the answer is 30 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of years required is \\boxed{30}."
