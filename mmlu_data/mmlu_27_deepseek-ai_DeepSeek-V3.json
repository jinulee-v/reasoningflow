        "response": "The presence of homologous structures in two different organisms, such as the humerus in the front limb of a human and a bird, indicates that these organisms share a common ancestor. Homologous structures are anatomical features that are similar in structure and origin but may serve different functions in different species. This similarity arises because the structures are inherited from a shared ancestor, even though they may have evolved to perform different tasks over time due to divergent evolution. The study of homologous structures is a key piece of evidence supporting the theory of evolution and the idea that all life on Earth is related through common descent."
