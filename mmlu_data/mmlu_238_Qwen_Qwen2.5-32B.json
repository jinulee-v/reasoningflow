        "question": "On January 1, year 1, Alpha Co. signed an annual maintenance agreement with a software provider for $15,000 and the maintenance period begins on March 1, year 2. Alpha also incurred $5,000 of costs on January 1, year 1, related to software modification requests that will increase the functionality of the software. Alpha depreciates and amortizes its computer and software assets over five years using the straight-line method. What amount is the total expense that Alpha should recognize related to the maintenance agreement and the software modifications for the year ended December 31, year 1?",
        "response": "The total expense that Alpha should recognize related to the maintenance agreement and the software modifications for the year ended December 31, year 1 is $10,000. This is because the maintenance agreement is not yet effective until March 1, year 2, and the software modification costs are capitalized and amortized over five years using the straight-line method. Therefore, the total expense for the year ended December 31, year 1 is $5,000 (software modification costs) + $5,000 (amortization of software modification costs) = $10,000."
