        "question": "A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here where there's a point charge Q = +1 mC fixed at the origin, and I need to find out how much work is required to move another charge, which is +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to (3 meters, 0). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that work done in moving a charge in an electric field is related to the change in electric potential energy. The formula for work done (W) is equal to the change in potential energy (\u0394U), right? So, W = \u0394U = U_final - U_initial.\n\nNow, the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's Law for potential energy: U = k * (Q1 * Q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, Q1 and Q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. Since both charges are positive, the potential energy will be positive, and moving them closer would require work against the repulsive force, while moving them apart would release energy.\n\nWait, but in this case, the charge we're moving is going from (0,4) to (3,0). Let me visualize this. The fixed charge is at the origin, so the initial position of the moving charge is 4 meters along the y-axis, and the final position is 3 meters along the x-axis. So, the distance from the origin changes from 4 meters to 3 meters? Wait, no, actually, the distance from the origin to (0,4) is indeed 4 meters, and to (3,0) is 3 meters. So the distance is decreasing from 4m to 3m. Since both charges are positive, moving them closer would require work against the electric field, so the work done should be positive?\n\nBut let me confirm the formula again. The potential energy U is k*(Q1*Q2)/r. Since both charges are positive, U is positive. So when moving the charge from a larger distance (4m) to a smaller distance (3m), the potential energy increases, so the work done by an external force would be positive, right? Because the system's potential energy is increasing, so you have to put in work.\n\nAlternatively, if the charges were opposite, moving them closer would decrease potential energy, so work done by the field would be positive, but since they are both positive, moving them closer requires work against the field.\n\nOkay, so the work done is equal to the change in potential energy. So I need to compute U_final - U_initial.\n\nFirst, let's note the values:\n\nQ1 = +1 mC = 1 x 10^-3 C\n\nQ2 = +8 \u00b5C = 8 x 10^-6 C\n\nk = 8.988 x 10^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2 (approximately 9 x 10^9 for simplicity, but maybe I should use the exact value here)\n\nInitial distance r_initial is 4 meters (since it's at (0,4), so distance from origin is sqrt(0\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = 4 m)\n\nFinal distance r_final is 3 meters (since it's at (3,0), so sqrt(3\u00b2 + 0\u00b2) = 3 m)\n\nTherefore, the initial potential energy U_initial = k*(Q1*Q2)/r_initial\n\nSimilarly, U_final = k*(Q1*Q2)/r_final\n\nTherefore, the work done W = U_final - U_initial = k*Q1*Q2*(1/r_final - 1/r_initial)\n\nWait, hold on, actually, since W = \u0394U = U_final - U_initial, so substituting:\n\nW = k*Q1*Q2*(1/r_final - 1/r_initial)\n\nWait, but let me check the signs again. Since moving from r_initial to r_final, which is closer, so the potential energy increases, so U_final > U_initial, so the work done should be positive. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute Q1*Q2: (1e-3 C)*(8e-6 C) = 8e-9 C\u00b2\n\nThen, compute 1/r_final - 1/r_initial: (1/3 - 1/4) = (4 - 3)/12 = 1/12 \u2248 0.08333...\n\nSo, W = k * 8e-9 * (1/12)\n\nWait, but let me write it all out properly.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each term:\n\nU_initial = (8.988e9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2) * (1e-3 C) * (8e-6 C) / 4 m\n\nSimilarly, U_final = (8.988e9) * (1e-3) * (8e-6) / 3\n\nThen, subtract U_initial from U_final to get W.\n\nLet me compute U_initial first:\n\nFirst, compute the numerator: 8.988e9 * 1e-3 * 8e-6\n\nLet me compute 1e-3 * 8e-6 = 8e-9\n\nThen, 8.988e9 * 8e-9 = (8.988 * 8) * (1e9 * 1e-9) = 71.904 * 1 = 71.904\n\nThen divide by 4 m: 71.904 / 4 = 17.976 J\n\nSimilarly, U_final:\n\nSame numerator: 8.988e9 * 1e-3 *8e-6 = 71.904 as before, divided by 3 m:\n\n71.904 / 3 \u2248 23.968 J\n\nTherefore, the work done W = U_final - U_initial = 23.968 - 17.976 \u2248 5.992 J\n\nHmm, so approximately 6 Joules? Let me check the calculation again step by step to make sure.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the numerator:\n\nk = 8.988e9\n\nQ1 = 1e-3 C\n\nQ2 = 8e-6 C\n\nSo, k*Q1*Q2 = 8.988e9 * 1e-3 * 8e-6\n\nFirst multiply 1e-3 and 8e-6: 8e-9\n\nThen, 8.988e9 * 8e-9 = (8.988 * 8) * (1e9 * 1e-9) = 71.904 * 1 = 71.904. That's correct.\n\nThen, U_initial is 71.904 divided by 4, which is 17.976 J\n\nU_final is 71.904 divided by 3, which is approximately 23.968 J\n\nSubtracting gives 23.968 - 17.976 = 5.992 J, which is approximately 6 J. Since the question says \"how much work is required\", so the answer is positive 6 J?\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the formula right. The work done by the electric field is the negative of the change in potential energy, but the work done by an external agent is equal to the change in potential energy. Since we are moving the charge against the electric field (because both charges are positive, so the field from the fixed charge pushes the moving charge away, so moving it closer requires work against that field), so the work done by the external force is positive, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the work done by the electric field, it would be negative, but the question is asking for the work required, which is the work done by the external agent, so positive.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 6 J. Let me see if I can get a more precise value.\n\nLet me compute 71.904 divided by 3 exactly:\n\n71.904 / 3 = 23.968\n\n71.904 / 4 = 17.976\n\n23.968 - 17.976 = 5.992 J\n\nSo, 5.992 J. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 6.0 J. Since the given values are in meters with one decimal (4 and 3), but the charges are given as 1 mC and 8 \u00b5C, which are exact? Hmm, maybe we need to consider significant figures.\n\nThe charges: 1 mC is 1 x 10^-3 C, which is one significant figure? Wait, 1 mC could be considered as one significant figure. 8 \u00b5C is one significant figure as well. The distances are 4 meters and 3 meters, which are also one significant figure each. Hmm, so if all given quantities have one significant figure, then the answer should be rounded to one significant figure, which would be 6 J. But maybe the problem expects more precise?\n\nWait, actually, 1 mC is 1.0 mC? Maybe it's two significant figures? The problem says +1 mC and +8 \u00b5C. If written as 1 mC, it's ambiguous, but maybe in the context of physics problems, they might consider it as exact? Hmm, perhaps the question expects an exact answer using the given numbers without worrying about significant figures. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"A point charge, Q = +1 mC, is fixed at the origin. How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\"\n\nThe charges are given as +1 mC and +8 \u00b5C. The distances are 4 meters and 3 meters. Since they are given as whole numbers, maybe they are exact, so we can treat them as precise. Then, the answer would be 5.992 J, which is approximately 6.0 J. But let me see if using more precise constants changes anything.\n\nWait, Coulomb's constant is 8.988 x 10^9, so let's use that exact value.\n\nLet me recalculate with more precision.\n\nFirst, compute k*Q1*Q2:\n\n8.988e9 * 1e-3 * 8e-6\n\nFirst, 1e-3 * 8e-6 = 8e-9\n\nThen, 8.988e9 * 8e-9 = 8.988 * 8 * (1e9 * 1e-9) = 71.904 * 1 = 71.904 exactly.\n\nSo that part is exact. Then, dividing by 4 and 3:\n\nU_initial = 71.904 / 4 = 17.976 J\n\nU_final = 71.904 / 3 = 23.968 J\n\nDifference is 23.968 - 17.976 = 5.992 J\n\nSo, 5.992 J. If we want to write it as 6.0 J, that's two significant figures. Since the given charges are 1 mC (1 sig fig) and 8 \u00b5C (1 sig fig), and distances 4 and 3 (1 sig fig each), so the least number of sig figs is 1, so the answer should be 6 J. But maybe the problem expects more precise? Let me check if the question is from a textbook or something where they might expect an exact fractional value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula for work done is indeed the change in potential energy. Since the charge is moving from point A to point B, the work done by an external force is equal to the change in potential energy, which is U_B - U_A. Since U is kQ1Q2/r, so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the potential at each point and then multiply by the charge being moved?\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the work done is the charge being moved (Q2) multiplied by the potential difference between the two points (\u0394V). Since potential V due to a point charge is kQ1/r, so the potential difference \u0394V = V_final - V_initial = kQ1*(1/r_final - 1/r_initial). Then, the work done is Q2 * \u0394V = Q2 * kQ1*(1/r_final - 1/r_initial), which is the same as before. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So 5.992 J, which is approximately 6 J. Since the problem uses \"mC\" and \"\u00b5C\", which are metric prefixes, but the numbers are given as whole numbers, so maybe the answer is 6 J. Alternatively, perhaps they want an exact fraction?\n\nWait, 5.992 is very close to 6, so maybe 6 J is acceptable. Alternatively, let me see if there's a calculation mistake.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the difference between 23.968 and 17.976:\n\n23.968 minus 17.976:\n\n23.968\n\n-17.976\n\n= (23 - 17) + (0.968 - 0.976)\n\n= 6 + (-0.008)\n\n= 5.992\n\nYes, that's correct. So 5.992 J. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use more precise value of k? Let me see.\n\nThe exact value of Coulomb's constant is approximately 8.9875517879 x 10^9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2. Let me use that.\n\nSo, k = 8.9875517879e9\n\nThen, k*Q1*Q2 = 8.9875517879e9 * 1e-3 *8e-6\n\nAgain, 1e-3 *8e-6 =8e-9\n\nMultiply by k: 8.9875517879e9 *8e-9 = 8.9875517879 *8 = let's compute that:\n\n8 * 8 = 64, 0.9875517879 *8 \u2248 7.9004143032\n\nTotal is 64 +7.9004143032 \u224871.9004143032\n\nSo, approximately 71.9004143\n\nThen, U_initial = 71.9004143 /4 \u224817.975103575 J\n\nU_final =71.9004143 /3 \u224823.9668047667 J\n\nDifference: 23.9668047667 -17.975103575 \u22485.9917011917 J\n\nSo, approximately 5.9917 J, which is about 5.99 J. So, 5.99 J. Hmm, so maybe 6.0 J if we round to two decimal places, but given the problem's data, perhaps 6 J is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an exact fractional value?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe difference in the reciprocals is (1/3 -1/4)=1/12. So, the work is k*Q1*Q2*(1/12). Let's compute that:\n\nk*Q1*Q2 = (8.988e9)(1e-3)(8e-6) = 8.988e9 *8e-9 = 71.904 as before.\n\nMultiply by 1/12: 71.904 /12 = 5.992 J. So exactly 5.992 J. So, perhaps the answer is 6.0 J, but maybe they want it in terms of exact decimals?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the work done by the electric field is negative of the change in potential energy. But the question is asking for the work required, which is the work done by an external agent, so it's equal to the change in potential energy. Since moving the charge closer increases the potential energy, so the work done by the external agent is positive, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I had done U_initial - U_final, that would be negative, but that would be the work done by the electric field. Since the problem says \"work required\", which is the work done against the field, so positive.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is approximately 6.0 J. Since in the problem statement, all given values are integers, so maybe they expect an exact answer of 6 J. Alternatively, perhaps 6.0 J to show two significant figures? Let me check the original numbers again.\n\nThe charges are given as +1 mC and +8 \u00b5C. The 1 mC is one significant figure, 8 \u00b5C is one as well. The distances are 4 meters and 3 meters, which are also one significant figure each. Therefore, the answer should have one significant figure, so 6 J. But maybe in some contexts, the 1 mC is considered as two significant figures if the decimal is implied? Like 1.0 mC? Hmm, but it's written as 1 mC. Similarly, 8 \u00b5C could be one or two? If it's written as 8.0 \u00b5C, that would be two, but as 8 \u00b5C, it's one. So, safest is one significant figure, so 6 J. But maybe the question expects more precise, so 6.0 J? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a textbook where they use 9e9 for Coulomb's constant for simplicity. Let me check that.\n\nIf we use k = 9e9 N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2, then:\n\nk*Q1*Q2 = 9e9 *1e-3 *8e-6 = 9e9 *8e-9 = 72 J\u00b7m (Wait, no, let me compute step by step)\n\nWait, 9e9 *1e-3 = 9e6, then 9e6 *8e-6 = 72. So, 72 J\u00b7m? Wait, no, the units would be (N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2)*(C)*(C)/m = N\u00b7m, which is Joules. Wait, actually, the units are correct.\n\nWait, let me recalculate with k=9e9:\n\nk = 9e9\n\nQ1 = 1e-3 C\n\nQ2 =8e-6 C\n\nSo, k*Q1*Q2 = 9e9 *1e-3 *8e-6 = 9 *1*8 * (1e9 *1e-3 *1e-6) = 72 * (1e0) = 72 J\u00b7m? Wait, no, actually, the units:\n\nk has units N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2,\n\nQ1 and Q2 are in C,\n\nso k*Q1*Q2 has units N\u00b7m\u00b2/C\u00b2 * C * C = N\u00b7m\u00b2,\n\nthen divided by meters (r) gives N\u00b7m, which is Joules. So yes.\n\nTherefore, with k=9e9,\n\nU_initial = 72 /4 = 18 J,\n\nU_final =72 /3 =24 J,\n\nso the difference is 24 -18 =6 J exactly.\n\nAh! So if we use k=9e9, which is a common approximation, then the answer is exactly 6 J. Since in many textbooks, Coulomb's constant is approximated as 9e9 for simplicity, so maybe that's the case here. The problem might expect that approximation, leading to exactly 6 J. Therefore, the answer is 6 J.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 6 Joules. So I should write that as the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe work required is \\boxed{6} joules.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the work required to move a charge \\( Q_2 = +8 \\, \\mu C \\) from the point (0, 4 meters) to (3 meters, 0) in the presence of a fixed charge \\( Q_1 = +1 \\, mC \\) at the origin, we use the concept of electric potential energy.
