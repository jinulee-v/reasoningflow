        "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative preparation should include treatment with which of the following?",
        "response": "The patient's elevated blood pressure and the presence of an adrenal mass suggest the possibility of an adrenal tumor, such as a pheochromocytoma or an aldosterone-producing adenoma. Given the patient's history and the scheduled adrenalectomy, it is important to stabilize his blood pressure before surgery to minimize the risk of complications during and after the procedure. The initial preoperative preparation should include treatment with an alpha-blocker, such as phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin, to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crises. Beta-blockers should be avoided until after alpha-blockade has been established, as they can precipitate unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation and worsen hypertension."
