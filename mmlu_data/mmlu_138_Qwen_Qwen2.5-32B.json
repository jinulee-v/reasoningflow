        "question": "A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?",
        "response": "To find the rate at which energy is being used by the microwave oven, we can use the formula:\n\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) \u00d7 Current (I)\n\nGiven that the voltage (V) is 120 V and the current (I) is 2 amps, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 120 V \u00d7 2 A\n\nP = 240 watts\n\nSo, the microwave oven is using energy at a rate of 240 watts."
