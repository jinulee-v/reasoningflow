        "response": "Women's ability to have multiple orgasms is primarily due to the fact that they do not have a refractory period like men do. This means that women can experience multiple orgasms in a short period of time without any interruption. Additionally, women's sexual response cycle is different from men's, and they can experience a plateau phase where they can maintain a high level of sexual arousal without reaching orgasm. This allows them to have multiple orgasms in a row. However, it's important to note that not all women are able to have multiple orgasms, and it's not a requirement for a satisfying sexual experience."
