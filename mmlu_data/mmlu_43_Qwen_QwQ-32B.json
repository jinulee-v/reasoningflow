        "question": "Suppose that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x. If f is a polynomial and f(5) = 11, then f(15/2)",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Suppose that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x. If f is a polynomial and f(5) = 11, then find f(15/2). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem states that f is a polynomial and that it has a periodicity of 1, meaning that shifting the input by 1 doesn't change the output. Wait a second, polynomials are functions that are defined by terms like x^n, right? But periodic functions like sine or cosine are not polynomials. The only periodic polynomial I can think of is a constant function because if a non-constant polynomial were periodic, that would mean it repeats its values over an interval, but polynomials tend to go to infinity or negative infinity as x increases or decreases. So maybe the only polynomial that's periodic is a constant polynomial?\n\nLet me verify that. Suppose f is a non-constant polynomial. Then, as x becomes very large, the value of f(x) will grow without bound (if the leading coefficient is positive) or go to negative infinity (if the leading coefficient is negative), unless it's a constant. But if f is periodic with period 1, then f(x + 1) = f(x) for all x. So, for example, f(0) = f(1) = f(2) = ... and so on. But if the polynomial is non-constant, then as x increases, f(x) should get larger (or smaller), but here it's staying the same at each integer point. Hmm, but maybe even between integers?\n\nWait, actually, if f is periodic with period 1, then not only at integers but everywhere. For example, f(0.5) = f(1.5) = f(2.5), etc. But again, if the polynomial is non-constant, how can it repeat its values every 1 unit? Let me think of a linear function. Suppose f(x) = ax + b. Then f(x + 1) = a(x + 1) + b = ax + a + b. For this to equal f(x), we need a = 0. So only constant functions work for degree 1.\n\nSimilarly, for quadratic: f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. Then f(x + 1) = a(x + 1)^2 + b(x + 1) + c = a(x\u00b2 + 2x + 1) + b(x + 1) + c = ax\u00b2 + (2a + b)x + (a + b + c). For this to equal f(x), we need:\n\nCoefficient of x\u00b2: a = a, which is okay.\n\nCoefficient of x: 2a + b = b \u21d2 2a = 0 \u21d2 a = 0.\n\nConstant term: a + b + c = c \u21d2 same as above, so a must be 0. So again, reduces to linear, which must have a = 0, so again constant.\n\nSame with higher degrees. Suppose f is a cubic: f(x) = ax\u00b3 + ... Then f(x + 1) would have a term with x\u00b3, but to have f(x + 1) = f(x), the coefficients of x\u00b3 must be zero, so a = 0. So in general, the only polynomial that is periodic is a constant function.\n\nTherefore, since the problem says f is a polynomial with period 1, it must be constant. But then they say f(5) = 11. So if it's constant, then f(x) = 11 for all x, so f(15/2) would also be 11. Is that the answer?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The problem says \"Suppose that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x\". So that's the definition of a function with period 1. And since f is a polynomial, the only such functions are constants. Therefore, f must be constant 11. Therefore, f(15/2) is 11. That seems straightforward, but maybe I need to write it more formally?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to see this. Suppose f is a polynomial satisfying f(x + 1) = f(x). Then, the difference f(x + 1) - f(x) = 0 for all x. But for a polynomial f, the difference f(x + 1) - f(x) is a polynomial of degree deg(f) - 1 if f is of degree at least 1. For example, if f is linear, degree 1, then the difference is a constant (degree 0). If f is quadratic, the difference is linear, etc. But since this difference is the zero polynomial, that would mean that the coefficients must all be zero. So starting from the leading term: suppose f(x) = a_n x^n + ... Then f(x + 1) has leading term a_n (x + 1)^n = a_n x^n + n a_n x^{n-1} + ... So when subtracting f(x +1) - f(x), the leading term would be n a_n x^{n - 1}. For this to be zero for all x, we need n a_n = 0. Since a_n \u2260 0 (it's the leading coefficient), we must have n = 0. Therefore, the polynomial must be constant. So that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, f is constant 11, so f(15/2) is 11. Hmm, seems like the answer is 11. But maybe I need to check if there's a trick here?\n\nWait, the problem says \"for all real x\", so the periodicity is over the reals. If a polynomial is periodic over an infinite interval, then it must be constant. That's a theorem, right? Because non-constant polynomials are unbounded, but periodic functions must be bounded, so the only way that works is if it's constant. So yeah, that's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, suppose f is a non-constant polynomial with period 1. Then f(n) = f(0) for all integers n, but as n grows, f(n) would have to stay constant, which is impossible unless the polynomial is constant. So that's another angle.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 11. Maybe the problem is testing whether the student realizes that the only periodic polynomials are constants. Since they gave f(5)=11, then all values are 11, so f(15/2)=11.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me suppose that maybe the question had a typo or I misread something. Let me check again:\n\n\"Suppose that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x. If f is a polynomial and f(5) = 11, then f(15/2)\u2026\"\n\nNo, that's what it says. So yeah, the function is periodic with period 1, polynomial, so constant. Therefore, the answer is 11. Maybe they wanted to trick people into thinking about trigonometric functions or something else, but since it's specified as a polynomial, it's got to be constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that 15/2 is 7.5, and since 5 is 2.5 less than 7.5, but since the period is 1, you could subtract 2.5 periods? Wait, but periods are 1, so to get from 5 to 7.5, you add 2.5, which is not an integer multiple? Wait, but the period is 1, so f(5) = f(6) = f(7) = f(8) etc., but 7.5 is not an integer. Hmm, but the function is periodic for all real numbers, so f(7.5) = f(7.5 -1) = f(6.5) = f(5.5) = ... = f(5) if you subtract 1 three times? Wait, 7.5 - 2.5 = 5, but 2.5 is not an integer multiple? Wait, actually, since the period is 1, then f(x + n) = f(x) for any integer n. So to get from 7.5 to 5, you need to subtract 2.5, which is not an integer. So that approach might not work unless the function is constant.\n\nTherefore, since the function is constant, f(15/2)=11. Yeah, that must be it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(1 + x) = f(x) \\) for all real \\( x \\) and \\( f \\) is a polynomial, we need to determine \\( f\\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right) \\) given that \\( f(5) = 11 \\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that the condition \\( f(1 + x) = f(x) \\) implies that \\( f \\) is a periodic function with period 1. However, the only polynomials that are periodic are constant polynomials. This is because non-constant polynomials tend to infinity or negative infinity as \\( x \\) increases or decreases, which contradicts the periodic nature of the function.\n\nTo confirm this, consider the difference \\( f(x + 1) - f(x) \\). For a polynomial \\( f \\) of degree \\( n \\), this difference would result in a polynomial of degree \\( n - 1 \\). Since \\( f(x + 1) - f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), the leading coefficient of this polynomial must be zero. This implies that the original polynomial must be of degree 0, i.e., a constant.\n\nGiven that \\( f \\) is a constant polynomial and \\( f(5) = 11 \\), it follows that \\( f(x) = 11 \\) for all \\( x \\). Therefore, \\( f\\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right) = 11 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]"

            "text": "**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{11}\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( f(1 + x) = f(x) \\) for all real \\( x \\) and \\( f \\) is a polynomial, we need to determine \\( f\\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right) \\) given that \\( f(5) = 11 \\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that the condition \\( f(1 + x) = f(x) \\) implies that \\( f \\) is a periodic function with period 1. However, the only polynomials that are periodic are constant polynomials. This is because non-constant polynomials tend to infinity or negative infinity as \\( x \\) increases or decreases, which contradicts the periodic nature of the function.\n\nTo confirm this, consider the difference \\( f(x + 1) - f(x) \\). For a polynomial \\( f \\) of degree \\( n \\), this difference would result in a polynomial of degree \\( n - 1 \\). Since \\( f(x + 1) - f(x) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\), the leading coefficient of this polynomial must be zero. This implies that the original polynomial must be of degree 0, i.e., a constant.\n\nGiven that \\( f \\) is a constant polynomial and \\( f(5) = 11 \\), it follows that \\( f(x) = 11 \\) for all \\( x \\). Therefore, \\( f\\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right) = 11 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{11}\n\\]",
