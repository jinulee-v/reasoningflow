    },
    "raw_text": {
        "question": "To ensure the independence of the non-executive board members, they are a number of steps which can be taken, which include non-executives being drawn from _______ the company, being appointed for a _________ time period as well as being appointed _________.",
        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this fill-in-the-blank question. The user is asking about steps to ensure the independence of non-executive board members. The sentence has three blanks: \"drawn from _______ the company,\" \"appointed for a _________ time period,\" and \"appointed _________.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall what makes non-executive board members independent. Independence usually means they don't have any conflicting interests with the company. So, for the first blank, \"drawn from _______ the company,\" the opposite of inside would be outside. So maybe \"outside the company.\" That makes sense because if they're from outside, they're less likely to have personal ties.\n\nNext, the second blank is \"appointed for a _________ time period.\" Independent directors often have term limits to prevent them from becoming too cozy with the company. Terms like fixed or specific come to mind. But commonly, it's referred to as a \"fixed term.\" Alternatively, maybe \"limited\" or \"specific.\" But \"fixed\" is a standard term here. For example, a fixed three-year term. So \"fixed\" fits here.\n\nThe third blank is \"being appointed _________.\" This part probably relates to the process of appointment. Independent directors should be appointed through a transparent and fair process, maybe by a nomination committee rather than by existing executives. So phrases like \"by an independent committee\" or \"through a formal process.\" The common term here might be \"independently\" or \"by a nomination committee.\" But the sentence structure is \"being appointed _________,\" so an adverb or a prepositional phrase. If I think of common phrases, \"on merit\" or \"through a transparent process,\" but maybe \"independently\" works. Wait, but \"appointed independently\" might not be the exact term. Alternatively, \"by shareholders\" could be another possibility because shareholders vote on board members. However, the key point is that their appointment isn't influenced by management. So perhaps \"by an independent nomination committee\" or \"through a shareholder vote.\" But the sentence structure needs a short phrase. Maybe \"independently\" is the best fit here, but I need to check standard terminology.\n\nPutting it all together: non-executives should be from outside the company, appointed for a fixed time period, and appointed independently (or through an independent process). Let me verify. Corporate governance guidelines often state that non-executive directors should be independent, not part of the company's management, serve for a fixed term to ensure rotation, and be appointed through an independent process to avoid bias. So the answers are likely \"outside,\" \"fixed,\" and \"independently.\" Alternatively, \"external\" for the first blank, but \"outside\" is more common. The time period is \"fixed term,\" so \"fixed.\" The last one could be \"by an independent committee,\" but the blank is after \"appointed,\" so maybe \"independently\" as an adverb. Let me check examples. For instance, in the UK Corporate Governance Code, they mention that non-executives should be independent, appointed for a specified term, and appointed through a formal process. But the exact wording here might be \"appointed independently.\" Hmm. Alternatively, \"on a rotating basis\" for the third blank? No, that's more about term limits. Wait, the three steps are: 1) being from outside, 2) fixed term, 3) appointed in a way that ensures independence. So the third blank could be \"by shareholders\" or \"through a transparent process,\" but the sentence structure needs a short phrase. Maybe \"independently\" is acceptable. Let me go with \"outside,\" \"fixed,\" and \"independently.\" That seems to fit standard corporate governance practices."
