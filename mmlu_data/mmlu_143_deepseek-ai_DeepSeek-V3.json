        "question": "According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which of the following must an educational agency do before it changes the educational placement of a student with a disability?",
        "response": "According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), before an educational agency changes the educational placement of a student with a disability, it must:\n\n1. **Provide Prior Written Notice**: The agency must provide the parents with prior written notice of the proposed change in placement. This notice must include a description of the proposed action, the reasons for the proposed change, and a statement of the procedural safeguards available to the parents.\n\n2. **Convene an Individualized Education Program (IEP) Meeting**: The agency must convene an IEP team meeting to discuss the proposed change in placement. The IEP team includes the parents, the student (if appropriate), and relevant school personnel. The team must review the student's current IEP and determine if the proposed change is appropriate to meet the student's educational needs.\n\n3. **Obtain Parental Consent**: In most cases, the agency must obtain written consent from the parents before implementing the change in placement. If the parents do not consent, the agency may initiate a due process hearing to seek authorization for the change.\n\n4. **Consider the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)**: The agency must ensure that the proposed placement is in the least restrictive environment appropriate for the student, meaning that the student should be educated with non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate.\n\n5. **Conduct a Manifestation Determination Review (if applicable)**: If the change in placement is due to disciplinary reasons, the IEP team must conduct a manifestation determination review to determine if the behavior leading to the disciplinary action was a manifestation of the student's disability. If the behavior is found to be a manifestation of the disability, the student generally cannot be removed from their current placement, and the IEP team must consider alternative strategies to address the behavior.\n\nThese steps ensure that the rights of the student and their parents are protected and that any changes in placement are made in the best interest of the student's educational needs."
