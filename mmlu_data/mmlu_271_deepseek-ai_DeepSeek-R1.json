        "question": "How did NSC-68 change U.S. strategy?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how NSC-68 changed U.S. strategy. Let me start by recalling what NSC-68 is. I think it was a National Security Council document from the Cold War era, maybe around 1950. It was a policy paper that shaped U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War. \n\nFirst, I should remember the context. After World War II, the U.S. and the Soviet Union were becoming rivals. The Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan were part of containment, right? But NSC-68 probably took that further. Before NSC-68, the U.S. was focused on economic aid and political support to contain communism. But maybe NSC-68 advocated for a more militarized approach.\n\nI think NSC-68 was written in response to the Soviet Union's development of nuclear weapons and the victory of the communists in China. The U.S. felt more threatened, so they needed a stronger response. The document might have called for a significant increase in military spending. Before NSC-68, the defense budget was lower, but after its adoption, spending went up. \n\nAlso, NSC-68 probably framed the Cold War as an existential struggle between freedom and slavery, which would justify a more aggressive stance. It might have led to the U.S. getting involved in Korea, Vietnam, and other conflicts. The document likely emphasized the need for alliances, like NATO, and building up nuclear arsenals. \n\nWait, how did it change strategy exactly? Before NSC-68, containment was more about economic measures. After NSC-68, military containment became central. The U.S. started building up its military forces, including nuclear weapons, and took a more global approach to counter communism anywhere. It also led to a long-term increase in defense budgets and a permanent military-industrial complex. \n\nI should check if NSC-68 was implemented right away. I think President Truman initially hesitated because of budget concerns, but the Korean War in 1950 pushed him to adopt it. So the Korean War was a catalyst for implementing NSC-68's recommendations. \n\nAnother point is that NSC-68 advocated for a policy of rollback, not just containment. Although, in practice, containment remained the main strategy. Maybe NSC-68's influence made the U.S. more proactive in confronting communism, leading to interventions and covert actions. \n\nAlso, the document might have influenced the arms race, as it called for a stronger military presence worldwide. This would include military aid to allies, which ties into things like the formation of SEATO or other alliances. \n\nIn summary, NSC-68 shifted U.S. strategy from primarily economic and political containment to a comprehensive military buildup, globalized containment, and a more aggressive stance against the Soviet Union, leading to increased defense spending, military alliances, and involvement in various conflicts during the Cold War."
