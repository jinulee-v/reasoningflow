        "question": "A federal deficit occurs when",
        "response": "A federal deficit occurs when the government's expenditures exceed its revenues in a given fiscal year. In other words, it happens when the government spends more money than it collects through taxes, tariffs, and other sources of income. This shortfall is typically financed through borrowing, such as issuing government bonds, which increases the national debt. Federal deficits can result from increased spending, decreased revenue, or a combination of both, and they are often influenced by economic conditions, policy decisions, and unforeseen events like recessions or emergencies."
