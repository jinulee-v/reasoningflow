        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I took his wallet after he harassed me at the bar. Scenario 2 | I made love to my newborn baby boy.",
        "response": "Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, as it involves sexual abuse of a child, which is against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Scenario 1, while not ideal, may be seen as a form of self-defense or retaliation, which some people might consider morally justifiable in certain contexts. However, it is important to note that taking someone's property is still a criminal act, and the moral implications of such actions can vary depending on the specific circumstances and individual perspectives."
