        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the term for the phenomenon where adults remember events from their adolescence better than other periods. Let me start by recalling what I know about memory and psychology. There's something called the \"reminiscence bump,\" which I think is related to how people tend to remember things from their younger years more vividly. But wait, is that specifically about adolescence?\n\nI remember that the reminiscence bump refers to the tendency for autobiographical memories to cluster in certain periods, especially young adulthood. But the question mentions adolescence specifically. Maybe it's the same concept but the term is still \"reminiscence bump\"? Let me check my notes. \n\nAlternatively, there's the term \"childhood amnesia,\" which is about forgetting events from early childhood, but that's the opposite. The question is about remembering adolescence better, so that's not it. \n\nAnother possibility is \"flashbulb memories,\" but those are more about shocking or emotionally charged events, not necessarily a period of life. \n\nWait, the reminiscence bump does cover adolescence and young adulthood. Let me think again. The bump is typically between late teens and thirties, so adolescence would fall into that. The term might still be the reminiscence bump. \n\nIs there a more specific term for adolescence specifically? Maybe not. The question says \"events from their adolescence better than from other periods,\" so the general term for the peak in memory recall for young adulthood/adolescence is the reminiscence bump. \n\nI think that's it. Let me confirm. When people are older, they remember more from their teens and 20s. Yes, that's the reminiscence bump. So the answer should be the reminiscence bump. \n\nAlternatively, could it be \"adolescent memory bump\"? Maybe some sources use that, but I think the standard term is just reminiscence bump. Let me see if I can recall any other terms. \n\nOh, there's also the \"narrative identity\" concept, but that's more about how people construct their life stories. Not exactly the same. \n\nAnother angle: the term might be linked to the idea that during adolescence, people form a lot of new memories as they experience new things, leading to better retention. The reminiscence bump is indeed explained by events during periods of high personal significance and novelty. \n\nSo I think the answer is the reminiscence bump. I'll go with that unless I'm missing something. Maybe check if the question is referring to a different term. Wait, sometimes it's called the \"autobiographical memory bump,\" but that's just another way of phrasing the same concept. \n\nYeah, I'm pretty sure it's the reminiscence bump. The key is that it's the period of adolescence and young adulthood where memories are more accessible later in life. So the answer should be the reminiscence bump.\n</think>\n\nThe phenomenon where adults tend to remember events from their adolescence better than from other periods in their lives is referred to as the **reminiscence bump**. \n\n### Explanation:\nThe **reminiscence bump** describes the tendency for people to recall more autobiographical memories from their adolescence and early adulthood (typically between the late teens and thirties) compared to other life stages. This is thought to occur because these years are often marked by significant life events, identity formation, and heightened emotional experiences, which create stronger and more vivid memories. The bump contrasts with childhood amnesia (forgetting early childhood) and the general decline in memory recall for events in middle and late adulthood. \n\nThis concept is well-established in psychological research on memory and lifespan development."
