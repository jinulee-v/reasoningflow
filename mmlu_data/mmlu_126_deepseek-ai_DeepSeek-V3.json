        "question": "Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?",
        "response": "Alright, I have this problem in front of me, and I need to figure out how long it will take for $300 to grow to $9600 at the same interest rate that doubles $5000 in six years. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n1. **Initial Information:**\n   - $5000 is invested at an annual interest rate of \\( x\\% \\).\n   - It takes 6 years for this investment to double, meaning it grows to $10,000.\n\n2. **Question:**\n   - At the same interest rate \\( x\\% \\), how many years will it take for $300 to grow to $9600?\n\nOkay, so I need to find the number of years it takes for $300 to become $9600 at the same interest rate that doubles $5000 in 6 years.\n\n### Breaking It Down\n\nI think this is a compound interest problem. The formula for compound interest is:\n\n\\[ A = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( A \\) = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- \\( P \\) = the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- \\( r \\) = the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- \\( n \\) = the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- \\( t \\) = the time the money is invested for, in years.\n\nIn this problem, the interest is compounded annually, so \\( n = 1 \\). That simplifies the formula to:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nGiven that, let's use the first part of the problem to find the interest rate \\( r \\).\n\n### Finding the Interest Rate \\( r \\)\n\nWe know that $5000 doubles to $10,000 in 6 years. So:\n\n\\[ 10,000 = 5,000 (1 + r)^6 \\]\n\nLet's solve for \\( r \\):\n\n1. Divide both sides by 5,000:\n\n\\[ 2 = (1 + r)^6 \\]\n\n2. Take the sixth root of both sides to solve for \\( 1 + r \\):\n\n\\[ 1 + r = 2^{1/6} \\]\n\n3. Subtract 1 from both sides to solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = 2^{1/6} - 1 \\]\n\nI need to calculate \\( 2^{1/6} \\). Let's see:\n\n\\[ 2^{1/6} \\approx 1.1225 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ r \\approx 1.1225 - 1 = 0.1225 \\]\n\nThat means the annual interest rate \\( r \\) is approximately 12.25%.\n\n### Applying the Interest Rate to the Second Part\n\nNow, I need to find out how many years it will take for $300 to grow to $9600 at the same interest rate of 12.25%.\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\n\\[ A = P (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ 9,600 = 300 (1 + 0.1225)^t \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ 9,600 = 300 (1.1225)^t \\]\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 300:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9,600}{300} = (1.1225)^t \\]\n\n\\[ 32 = (1.1225)^t \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( t \\). To do that, I'll take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(32) = \\ln((1.1225)^t) \\]\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule \\( \\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a) \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(32) = t \\ln(1.1225) \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(32)}{\\ln(1.1225)} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\n1. Calculate \\( \\ln(32) \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(32) \\approx 3.4657 \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\( \\ln(1.1225) \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(1.1225) \\approx 0.1155 \\]\n\nNow, divide:\n\n\\[ t \\approx \\frac{3.4657}{0.1155} \\approx 30 \\]\n\nSo, it will take approximately 30 years for $300 to grow to $9600 at an annual interest rate of 12.25%.\n\n### Verifying the Answer\n\nWait, let's double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. **Calculating \\( r \\):**\n\n   \\[ 2 = (1 + r)^6 \\]\n   \n   \\[ 1 + r = 2^{1/6} \\approx 1.1225 \\]\n   \n   \\[ r \\approx 0.1225 \\] or 12.25%\n\n   That seems correct.\n\n2. **Calculating \\( t \\):**\n\n   \\[ 32 = (1.1225)^t \\]\n   \n   \\[ t = \\frac{\\ln(32)}{\\ln(1.1225)} \\]\n   \n   \\[ \\ln(32) \\approx 3.4657 \\]\n   \n   \\[ \\ln(1.1225) \\approx 0.1155 \\]\n   \n   \\[ t \\approx \\frac{3.4657}{0.1155} \\approx 30 \\]\n\n   That also seems correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter verifying, it looks like it will take approximately **30 years** for $300 to grow to $9600 at the same interest rate.\n\n\\[\\boxed{30}\\]"
