        "question": " In which dynasty was the \"Mandate of Heaven\" developed to legitimatize the new rulers?",
        "response": "The concept of the \"Mandate of Heaven\" (\u5929\u547d, Ti\u0101nm\u00ecng) was developed during the **Zhou Dynasty** (1046\u2013256 BCE) in ancient China. It was used to justify the overthrow of the **Shang Dynasty** and to legitimize the Zhou rulers' authority. According to this doctrine, Heaven (Tian) granted the right to rule to a just and virtuous leader, and this mandate could be withdrawn if the ruler became tyrannical or incompetent, as evidenced by natural disasters, social unrest, or military defeats. This idea became a foundational principle of Chinese political philosophy and was invoked by subsequent dynasties to justify their rule."
