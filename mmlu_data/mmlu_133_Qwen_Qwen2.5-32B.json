        "question": "Which of the following is true of a price floor?",
        "response": "A price floor is a government-imposed minimum price that can be charged for a good or service. It is set above the equilibrium price to support producers and ensure they receive a certain level of income. The most common example of a price floor is the minimum wage, which sets a legal minimum for hourly wages. Other examples include agricultural price supports and rent control. Price floors can lead to surpluses, as the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the set price."
