        "question": "Large triplet repeat expansions can be detected by:",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how large triplet repeat expansions are detected. Let me start by recalling what triplet repeat expansions are. They are sequences where a three-nucleotide sequence is repeated many times, and when these repeats expand beyond a certain threshold, they can cause genetic disorders. Examples include Huntington's disease, Fragile X syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy.\n\nNow, the question is about detecting large expansions. I remember that standard PCR is sometimes used for genetic testing, but large repeats might be problematic for PCR because the DNA polymerase might not efficiently copy through long repetitive sequences. So maybe standard PCR isn't sufficient here. Southern blotting comes to mind as a technique that can handle larger DNA fragments. Southern blot involves cutting DNA with restriction enzymes, running a gel, transferring to a membrane, and using a probe to detect the size of the fragments. That could work for larger expansions since it doesn't require amplifying the entire repeat.\n\nAnother method might be triplet repeat primed PCR (TP-PCR). I think this is a variation of PCR where one primer is designed to anneal to the repeat region, allowing amplification even if the repeat is expanded. This method can detect the presence of an expansion without needing to determine the exact size. Then there's also Southern blot analysis, which as I mentioned earlier, can detect larger fragments that standard PCR can't handle. \n\nMaybe there's also something called methylation-specific PCR for cases where the expansion is associated with methylation, like in Fragile X syndrome. That technique detects methylation, which can indicate an expansion. Also, newer technologies like next-generation sequencing (NGS) might be able to detect repeat expansions, but I'm not sure how effective they are for very large repeats. Some specialized NGS approaches or long-read sequencing technologies like PacBio or Oxford Nanopore could handle longer repeats because they have longer read lengths. \n\nSo putting this together, the main methods would be Southern blot, TP-PCR, and possibly methylation-specific PCR. Southern blot is traditional and reliable for large expansions. TP-PCR is more modern and PCR-based but designed for repeats. NGS might be emerging but maybe not the first line. Also, maybe there's something called repeat expansion detection (RED), but I'm not too familiar with that. \n\nWait, I should check if there are other methods. Maybe multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)? MLPA can detect copy number variations, but I'm not sure if it's used for triplet repeats. Probably not the primary method. So the key ones are Southern blot, TP-PCR, and maybe some advanced sequencing techniques. Southern blot is definitely a classic answer here. Also, in some cases, if the expansion is in a gene that's being analyzed via other methods like gene sequencing, but traditional Sanger sequencing might not work well for large expansions because the repeats can cause the signal to drop out, making it hard to read the sequence beyond the repeat. So Southern blot and TP-PCR are more reliable. \n\nAnother thought: some diagnostic labs use a combination of PCR and Southern blot. For example, first try PCR to see if they can amplify the region. If PCR fails or shows a very large product, they might follow up with Southern blot to confirm the size. So both methods together. But the question is asking for how large triplet repeat expansions can be detected, so the answer should include Southern blotting and TP-PCR. Maybe also mention that traditional PCR is limited here. \n\nSo to summarize, the main techniques are Southern blot analysis and triplet repeat primed PCR. Advanced sequencing methods like long-read sequencing are also options but might not be as commonly used yet. Methylation-specific PCR could be relevant for specific cases where methylation occurs alongside the expansion."
