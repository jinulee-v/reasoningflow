        "response": "The single group within society that is most vulnerable to reference group influence is **adolescents** or **teenagers**. This is because they are in a critical stage of identity formation and are highly influenced by their peers, social media, and societal norms. Adolescents often seek acceptance and validation from their reference groups, which can significantly impact their behavior, attitudes, and decision-making. This susceptibility is driven by developmental factors, such as the need for social belonging and the ongoing process of establishing their own identity."
