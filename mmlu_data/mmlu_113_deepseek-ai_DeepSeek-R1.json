        "question": "The practice of hiring a foreign third-party service provider to run an operation is called",
        "response": "Okay, so the user is asking about the term for hiring a foreign third-party service provider to run an operation. Let me start by recalling what I know about business practices.\n\nFirst, outsourcing comes to mind. That's when a company contracts out certain tasks or functions to another company. But the question specifies a foreign third-party provider. So maybe it's a specific type of outsourcing. There's offshoring, which refers to moving operations to another country, often to reduce costs. But offshoring can be done by setting up a subsidiary or using a third-party. So if a company hires a third-party provider in another country, is that still offshoring or is there another term?\n\nWait, I think there's a term called \"offshore outsourcing.\" That combines both concepts: outsourcing to a foreign company. Alternatively, sometimes people just use \"outsourcing\" even when it's international, but maybe the precise term is offshore outsourcing. Let me verify.\n\nAnother possibility is \"business process outsourcing\" (BPO), which refers to contracting specific business tasks to third-party providers. If the BPO is done overseas, then it's offshore BPO. But the question is more general, not specific to business processes. So maybe the answer is offshore outsourcing. But I should check if there's a more specific term.\n\nWait, sometimes \"global outsourcing\" is used, but that's broader. The key here is that it's a foreign third-party. So offshore outsourcing seems accurate. Let me think if there's another term. Oh, sometimes companies refer to \"nearshoring\" when they outsource to a nearby country, like from the US to Mexico, but that's still a subset of offshore outsourcing.\n\nAlternatively, \"multisourcing\" refers to using multiple providers, but that's not related to location. So the main term would be offshore outsourcing. But I need to confirm if the standard answer is just \"outsourcing\" with the offshore aspect implied by the foreign part. However, the question specifically mentions a foreign third-party, so the answer should highlight the offshore component. Therefore, the correct term is \"offshoring\" or \"offshore outsourcing.\" Which one is more precise?\n\nIn business terminology, offshoring can be done by the company itself setting up a branch abroad, whereas offshore outsourcing specifically means contracting a third-party in another country. So the answer here is offshore outsourcing. But sometimes people use offshoring interchangeably. Let me check a reliable source. According to some business references, offshore outsourcing is the practice of contracting with a third-party provider in a different country to perform services or produce goods. So yes, that's the term. Therefore, the answer should be offshore outsourcing."
