        "question": "A 6-sided die is rolled 15 times and the results are: side 1 comes up 0 times; side 2: 1 time; side 3: 2 times; side 4: 3 times; side 5: 4 times; side 6: 5 times. Based on these results, what is the probability of side 3 coming up when using Add-1 Smoothing?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the probability of rolling side 3 on a 6-sided die after applying Add-1 Smoothing, given the results of 15 rolls where side 3 came up 2 times. Let me start by recalling what Add-1 Smoothing is. From what I remember, Add-1 Smoothing, also known as Laplace smoothing, is a technique used to adjust the probability estimates by adding a small value to each count. This helps in handling situations where a particular outcome hasn't been observed in the data, avoiding zero probabilities. \n\nIn this case, even though side 3 has been observed 2 times, we still apply Add-1 Smoothing to all sides. So, I think the formula for the smoothed probability of a particular outcome is (original count + 1) divided by (total number of observations + number of possible outcomes). Let me verify that. \n\nYes, Laplace smoothing adds 1 to each count, so each side's count becomes (count + 1). Then, the total number of trials becomes the original total plus the number of possible outcomes (since we added 1 to each outcome's count). For a die with 6 sides, that would be adding 6 to the total number of rolls. \n\nSo, the original counts for each side are: side 1: 0, side 2: 1, side 3: 2, side 4: 3, side 5: 4, side 6: 5. The total number of rolls is 15. After applying Add-1 Smoothing, each count becomes: side 1: 0 + 1 = 1, side 2: 1 + 1 = 2, side 3: 2 + 1 = 3, and so on up to side 6: 5 + 1 = 6. \n\nNow, the new total number of \"smoothed\" rolls would be the original total (15) plus the number of sides (6), which is 15 + 6 = 21. Therefore, the probability of side 3 coming up would be the smoothed count for side 3 divided by the smoothed total. That is, 3 / 21. Simplifying that fraction, 3 divided by 21 is 1/7. \n\nWait, let me check if I did that correctly. Original counts: 0,1,2,3,4,5. Adding 1 to each gives 1,2,3,4,5,6. Summing those: 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21. Yes, that's correct. So the denominator is 21. The numerator for side 3 is 3. So 3/21 reduces to 1/7. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Another way to think about it is that without smoothing, the probability of side 3 would be 2/15. With Add-1 Smoothing, we add 1 to the numerator and add 6 (the number of sides) to the denominator. So, (2 + 1)/(15 + 6) = 3/21 = 1/7. Yep, same result. \n\nSo, regardless of whether I adjust each count first and then compute the probability or adjust the numerator and denominator directly, I end up with 1/7. That seems right. \n\nJust to confirm, let me consider another side. For example, side 1, which had 0 counts originally. After smoothing, it's 1/21. Similarly, side 6 would be 6/21 = 2/7. That makes sense because higher original counts should still have higher probabilities after smoothing. \n\nTherefore, I think the probability of side 3 coming up with Add-1 Smoothing is indeed 1/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability of side 3 coming up when using Add-1 Smoothing is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{7}}."
