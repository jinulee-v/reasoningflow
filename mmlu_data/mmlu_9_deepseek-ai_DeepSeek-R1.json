        "question": "Which of the following is the body cavity that contains the pituitary gland?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which body cavity contains the pituitary gland. Let me start by recalling what I know about body cavities and the endocrine system. The pituitary gland is part of the endocrine system, right? It's often called the \"master gland\" because it controls other glands. But where exactly is it located?\n\nI remember that the human body has several main cavities: the cranial cavity, thoracic cavity, abdominal cavity, and pelvic cavity. The cranial cavity is in the skull and holds the brain. The thoracic cavity is in the chest, containing the heart and lungs. The abdominal and pelvic cavities are lower down, holding digestive organs, reproductive organs, etc.\n\nBut wait, the pituitary gland is a brain structure, isn't it? Or is it near the brain? I think it's located at the base of the brain. Maybe in the cranial cavity? But I also recall something about the sella turcica. The sella turcica is part of the sphenoid bone, which is in the skull. So the pituitary sits in the sella turcica. That would mean it's within the cranial cavity, which houses the brain. But I should double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's in a specific part of the cranial cavity. The cranial cavity is divided into regions, perhaps? The pituitary is part of the brain's structure, connected to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is in the brain, so the pituitary must be nearby. The pituitary has two parts: the anterior and posterior lobes. The posterior is connected to the hypothalamus via the infundibulum. So the pituitary is attached to the brain but sits in a bony structure. The sella turcica is a depression in the sphenoid bone, so the pituitary gland is nestled there. Therefore, the cavity would be the cranial cavity because it's within the skull. But wait, sometimes the sella turcica is considered part of the cranial cavity. Let me confirm.\n\nAnother thought: some sources might refer to the hypophyseal fossa, which is another name for the sella turcica. So the pituitary gland is in the hypophyseal fossa of the sphenoid bone, which is part of the cranial cavity. Therefore, the correct answer should be the cranial cavity. But I want to make sure there isn't a more specific term. For example, sometimes the cranial cavity is divided into smaller regions, but I don't think there's a separate cavity name for where the pituitary is. It's all part of the cranial cavity. So the answer is the cranial cavity. Wait, but I've heard the term \"third ventricle\" in the brain, but that's a brain ventricle, not a body cavity. Body cavities are larger spaces. So yes, the pituitary is in the cranial cavity. Let me check if any other options might be considered. For example, the nasal cavity is nearby, but the pituitary is above that. No, definitely in the cranial cavity. So the answer should be the cranial cavity."
