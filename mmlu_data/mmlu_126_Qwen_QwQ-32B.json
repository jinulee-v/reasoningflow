        "question": "Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$?",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Five thousand dollars compounded annually at an x% interest rate takes six years to double. At the same interest rate, how many years will it take $300 to grow to $9600?\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding what's being asked here. The first part is about doubling $5000 in six years with annual compounding. Then, using the same interest rate, we need to find out how long it takes for $300 to become $9600. \n\nFirst, I should probably recall the formula for compound interest. The formula is A = P(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount after t years, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), and t is the time in years. Since it's compounded annually, we don't have to worry about different compounding periods.\n\nAlright, so the first part says that $5000 doubles in six years. That means the amount after six years is $10,000. Let me write that down:\n\n10000 = 5000*(1 + r)^6\n\nI can divide both sides by 5000 to simplify:\n\n2 = (1 + r)^6\n\nSo, to find the interest rate r, I need to solve for r here. Since it's raised to the 6th power, I can take the 6th root of both sides. Alternatively, take the natural logarithm of both sides. Let me try both ways.\n\nFirst, taking the 6th root:\n\n(1 + r) = 2^(1/6)\n\nThen, r = 2^(1/6) - 1\n\nAlternatively, using logarithms:\n\nTake ln of both sides:\n\nln(2) = 6*ln(1 + r)\n\nThen, ln(1 + r) = ln(2)/6\n\nSo, 1 + r = e^(ln(2)/6)\n\nWhich simplifies to the same thing as before, since e^(ln(2)/6) is 2^(1/6). So either way, r = 2^(1/6) - 1.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me compute that value numerically so I can work with it more easily. Let me see, 2^(1/6). Since 2^(1/6) is the sixth root of 2. Let me approximate that. \n\nI know that 2^(1/2) is about 1.414, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 2^(1/4) is about 1.189, 2^(1/5) is around 1.1487, and 2^(1/6) would be a bit less. Let me use a calculator here. Wait, maybe I can remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So ln(2)/6 is approximately 0.1155. Then e^0.1155 is approximately... Let's see, e^0.1 is about 1.1052, e^0.1155 is a bit more. Maybe around 1.1225? Let me check:\n\n0.1155 * 1 = 0.1155. Let me use the Taylor series for e^x around 0:\n\ne^x \u2248 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6\n\nSo plugging in x = 0.1155:\n\n1 + 0.1155 + (0.1155)^2 / 2 + (0.1155)^3 / 6\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: 0.1155\n\nThird term: (0.01333) / 2 \u2248 0.006665\n\nFourth term: (0.00154) / 6 \u2248 0.000257\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 0.1155 = 1.1155; plus 0.006665 is 1.122165; plus 0.000257 is about 1.12242. So approximately 1.1224. Therefore, e^0.1155 \u2248 1.1224, so r \u2248 0.1224, or 12.24%.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute 2^(1/6):\n\nTake natural log of 2^(1/6) is (1/6) ln 2 \u2248 0.1155, so exponentiating gives the same result. Alternatively, using logarithm base 10? Maybe not necessary. Let me just confirm with another method. Let me compute 1.1224^6 and see if it's approximately 2.\n\nLet me compute 1.1224^2 first: 1.1224 * 1.1224. Let's see:\n\n1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21, but more precisely:\n\n1.1224 * 1.1224:\n\n1.1224 * 1 = 1.1224\n\n1.1224 * 0.1224 = ?\n\nWait, maybe better to do step by step:\n\n1.1224 squared:\n\n(1 + 0.1224)^2 = 1 + 2*0.1224 + (0.1224)^2 \u2248 1 + 0.2448 + 0.0150 \u2248 1.2598\n\nThen, 1.2598 squared is (1.2598)^2. Let's compute that:\n\n1.2598 * 1.2598 \u2248 1.2598^2. Let me compute 1.26^2 = 1.5876, so 1.2598^2 is slightly less, maybe 1.587?\n\nWait, actually, let me do it more accurately:\n\n1.2598 * 1.2598:\n\nFirst, 1 * 1.2598 = 1.2598\n\n0.2 * 1.2598 = 0.25196\n\n0.05 * 1.2598 = 0.06299\n\n0.0098 * 1.2598 \u2248 0.01235\n\nAdding those up:\n\n1.2598 + 0.25196 = 1.51176\n\n1.51176 + 0.06299 = 1.57475\n\n1.57475 + 0.01235 \u2248 1.5871\n\nSo, (1.2598)^2 \u2248 1.5871. Then, that's the fourth power of 1.1224, since we did squared twice. Wait, actually, first squared was 1.1224^2 \u2248 1.2598, then squared again gives 1.2598^2 \u2248 1.5871, so that's 1.1224^4 \u2248 1.5871.\n\nThen, to get to the sixth power, we need to multiply by another 1.1224^2, which is 1.2598. So 1.5871 * 1.2598 \u2248 ?\n\n1.5871 * 1 = 1.5871\n\n1.5871 * 0.2598 \u2248 ?\n\nFirst, 1.5871 * 0.2 = 0.31742\n\n1.5871 * 0.05 = 0.079355\n\n1.5871 * 0.0098 \u2248 0.01555\n\nAdding those: 0.31742 + 0.079355 = 0.396775 + 0.01555 \u2248 0.412325\n\nSo total is 1.5871 + 0.412325 \u2248 2.0 (approximately). Wow, that's pretty close. So 1.1224^6 \u2248 2.0. So that checks out. So the rate is approximately 12.24%.\n\nOkay, so that's the interest rate. Now, moving on to the second part: How many years will it take for $300 to grow to $9600 at the same interest rate?\n\nSo, we need to find t such that 9600 = 300*(1 + r)^t\n\nWe can write that as:\n\n9600 / 300 = (1 + r)^t\n\nSimplify 9600 / 300: 9600 divided by 300 is 32. Because 300*32 = 9600. So,\n\n32 = (1 + r)^t\n\nWe already know that (1 + r) is 2^(1/6), from the first part. Because we had (1 + r)^6 = 2, so (1 + r) = 2^(1/6). Therefore, substituting that in:\n\n32 = [2^(1/6)]^t\n\nWhich simplifies to 2^(t/6) = 32\n\nBut 32 is 2^5, so:\n\n2^(t/6) = 2^5\n\nTherefore, since the bases are equal, the exponents must be equal:\n\nt/6 = 5\n\nTherefore, t = 5*6 = 30 years.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, using logarithms:\n\nStarting from 32 = (1 + r)^t\n\nTake natural log of both sides:\n\nln(32) = t*ln(1 + r)\n\nWe know from earlier that ln(1 + r) = ln(2)/6, so substituting:\n\nln(32) = t*(ln(2)/6)\n\nTherefore, t = (ln(32)/ln(2)) *6\n\nBut ln(32)/ln(2) is log base 2 of 32, which is 5, since 2^5 =32. Therefore, t = 5*6 = 30. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that the amount is growing by a factor of 32, and since every 6 years it doubles, so how many doublings does it take to get to 32?\n\nSince 2^5 = 32, so 5 doublings. Each doubling takes 6 years, so 5*6=30 years. That's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 30 years.\n\nWait, let me just confirm with the numbers. Let's see, if the interest rate is approximately 12.24%, then let's see how much $300 would grow in 30 years.\n\nFirst, compute (1 + 0.1224)^30. Let's see, since (1.1224)^6 \u2248 2, so (1.1224)^30 = (2)^5 = 32. Exactly. So 300*32 = 9600. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the exact value of r = 2^(1/6) -1, then (1 + r)^t = (2^(1/6))^t = 2^(t/6). So setting that equal to 32 = 2^5, so t/6 =5, so t=30. So that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 30 years. \n\nBut let me just think again if there's another way someone might approach this problem and maybe make a mistake. For example, maybe someone might think that since it takes 6 years to double, then tripling would take 9 years or something? But no, because it's exponential growth, not linear. So the time to grow by a factor of 32 is 5 doubling periods, each 6 years. So 5*6=30. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think of using simple interest? But the problem says compounded annually, so it's definitely compound interest. So the method we used is correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's see, if $5000 doubles in 6 years, so the rate is such that (1 + r)^6 = 2. Then, for $300 to become $9600, that's a multiplication by 32. Since 32 is 2^5, so you need 5 doubling periods. Each period is 6 years, so 30 years. Yep, that's another way to see it without even calculating the exact rate. Since the doubling time is 6 years, the number of doublings needed is log2(32) =5, so 5*6=30. That's a smarter way, actually. Since the problem is about factors of 2, using the doubling time directly is efficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 30 years. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{30}\n</think>\n\nGiven that $5000 compounded annually at an \\( x\\% \\) interest rate doubles in six years, we need to determine how many years it will take for $300 to grow to $9600 at the same interest rate.\n\nFirst, we find the interest rate \\( r \\). The doubling of $5000 in six years can be expressed using the compound interest formula:\n\\[\n10000 = 5000(1 + r)^6\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 5000:\n\\[\n2 = (1 + r)^6\n\\]\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\\[\n\\ln(2) = 6 \\ln(1 + r)\n\\]\nSolving for \\( \\ln(1 + r) \\):\n\\[\n\\ln(1 + r) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{6}\n\\]\nExponentiating both sides:\n\\[\n1 + r = e^{\\ln(2)/6} = 2^{1/6}\n\\]\nThus, the interest rate \\( r \\) is:\n\\[\nr = 2^{1/6} - 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the time \\( t \\) for $300 to grow to $9600. Using the compound interest formula again:\n\\[\n9600 = 300(1 + r)^t\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 300:\n\\[\n32 = (1 + r)^t\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( 1 + r = 2^{1/6} \\):\n\\[\n32 = \\left(2^{1/6}\\right)^t\n\\]\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n\\[\n32 = 2^{t/6}\n\\]\nSince \\( 32 = 2^5 \\), we equate the exponents:\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{6} = 5\n\\]\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\\[\nt = 5 \\times 6 = 30\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take \\(\\boxed{30}\\) years for $300 to grow to $9600 at the same interest rate."
