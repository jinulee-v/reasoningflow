The key components of the welfare state included:\n\n1. **The National Health Service (NHS)**: Providing free healthcare for all.\n2. **Social Security**: Offering financial support through benefits and pensions to those in need.\n3. **Education**: Expanding access to education for all.\n4. **Housing**: Improving living conditions and providing affordable housing.\n5. **Employment**: Promoting full employment and supporting those out of work.\n\nThe welfare state did **not** aim to provide **universal basic income** or **profit-sharing schemes** for all citizens. These concepts were not part of the original framework of the 1948 welfare state, as its focus was on addressing specific social and economic issues rather than redistributing wealth or income in such a broad manner."
