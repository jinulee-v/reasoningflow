        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | During the house's demolition, I pushed him into a wall. Scenario 2 | When I choose a babysitter for my twin nieces, I don't care about her racial background.",
        "response": "Scenario 1 is the one where the main character does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Pushing someone into a wall during a house's demolition is an act of physical violence and aggression, which is generally considered morally wrong. In contrast, Scenario 2 reflects a morally positive stance, as the main character does not discriminate against the babysitter based on her racial background, which aligns with the principles of equality and non-discrimination."
