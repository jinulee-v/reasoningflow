        "question": "As of 2019, about what percentage of Russians say it is very important to have free media in our country without government/state censorship?",
        "response": "As of 2019, public opinion surveys in Russia indicated that a significant portion of the population valued the importance of free media without government or state censorship. According to a 2019 poll by the Levada Center, an independent Russian polling organization, **about 37% of Russians** said it was \"very important\" to have free media without censorship. However, this percentage has fluctuated over time, reflecting the complex and often polarized views on media freedom in Russia. Many Russians also expressed concerns about the potential for media to spread misinformation, which complicates attitudes toward censorship and freedom of the press."
