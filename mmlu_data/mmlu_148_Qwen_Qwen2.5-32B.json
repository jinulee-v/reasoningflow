        "question": "A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:",
        "response": "The mean weight of the smartwatch and its packaging together would be the sum of their individual means, which is 62 grams + 456 grams = 518 grams. The standard deviation of the combined weight would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual standard deviations, which is sqrt(1.0^2 + 6^2) = 6.08 grams. Therefore, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have a mean of 518 grams and a standard deviation of 6.08 grams."
