        "question": "A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?",
        "response": "Okay, so there's this problem here: 30 players are going to play basketball at a park, and each team needs exactly 5 players. The question is asking which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many teams can be made with 30 players when each team has 5 players. That seems straightforward, but let me break it down. If each team has 5 players, then the number of teams would be the total number of players divided by the number of players per team. So, mathematically, that would be 30 divided by 5. Let me check that.\n\n30 divided by 5 is 6. So, does that mean there would be 6 teams? Let me visualize it. If you have 6 teams and each has 5 players, then 6 times 5 is 30, which matches the total number of players. That makes sense. So, division is the operation needed here. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes problems like this can have a trick, like if there are leftovers or something. For example, if the total number wasn't a multiple of 5, you might have to round up or down. But in this case, 30 is exactly divisible by 5, so there's no remainder. So, 30 divided by 5 equals 6 exactly. Therefore, 6 teams are needed. \n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multiplication? If I consider how many teams there are, each contributing 5 players, then multiplying the number of teams by 5 should give me the total number of players. So, if I let the number of teams be 't', then 5t = 30. Solving for t, I divide both sides by 5, which gives t = 6. Yep, same answer. \n\nAlternatively, using repeated subtraction: starting with 30 players, subtract 5 each time until you reach zero. How many times did you subtract 5? That would be 30 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 = 0. So, subtracted 5 six times, which means 6 teams. \n\nOr addition: adding 5 players each time until you get to 30. 5 +5 +5 +5 +5 +5 = 30. That's six 5s, so again 6 teams. \n\nAll these methods point to the same answer: 6 teams. So, the mathematical operation required is division. The correct explanation should involve dividing the total number of players by the number of players per team. \n\nBut let me check the possible statements (even though they aren't provided here). Since the user mentions \"which statement correctly explains,\" I need to make sure that the explanation uses division of total players by players per team. For example, a correct statement would be: \"Divide the total number of players by 5, the number of players per team, to find the number of teams needed.\" \n\nIf there were a wrong statement, it might say to multiply 30 by 5, which would be incorrect, or to subtract 5 from 30 repeatedly, which isn't efficient but technically could work, but division is the standard method. Alternatively, a wrong statement might suggest using addition instead of division, which is not the most straightforward approach. \n\nSince 30 divided by 5 is 6, and all verification methods confirm that, the correct explanation must involve division. Therefore, the answer is that you divide 30 by 5 to get 6 teams."
