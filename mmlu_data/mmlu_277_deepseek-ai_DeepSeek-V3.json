The study collected extensive demographic, clinical, behavioral, and biological data over time, along with storing blood and tissue samples. This rich repository of data and specimens allowed researchers to efficiently conduct nested case-control studies by:\n\n1. **Identifying cases and controls retrospectively**: Cases (e.g., individuals who developed a specific outcome, such as AIDS) and matched controls (e.g., individuals who did not develop the outcome) could be selected from the cohort after sufficient follow-up time.\n2. **Leveraging pre-existing data**: Detailed baseline and follow-up data reduced the need for additional data collection, saving time and resources.\n3. **Analyzing stored samples**: Researchers could test stored biological samples for biomarkers, genetic factors, or other exposures of interest, even years after the samples were collected.\n\nThis infrastructure made nested case-control studies a cost-effective and efficient method to investigate specific hypotheses within the MACS cohort."
