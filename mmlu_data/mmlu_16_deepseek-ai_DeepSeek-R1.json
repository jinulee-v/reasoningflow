        "question": "_______ is the direct attempt to formally or informally manage ethical issues or problems, through specific policies, practices and programmes.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what word fills in the blank in the sentence: \"_______ is the direct attempt to formally or informally manage ethical issues or problems, through specific policies, practices and programmes.\" Let me start by breaking down the sentence to understand what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, the sentence is talking about a concept that involves managing ethical issues either formally or informally. The methods mentioned are specific policies, practices, and programs. So, the missing term is likely a noun that refers to the systematic approach organizations take to handle ethics-related matters.\n\nLet me think about related terms. There's \"corporate social responsibility\" (CSR), but that's more about a company's responsibility towards society, not specifically managing ethical issues. Then there's \"ethics management,\" which sounds more direct. But maybe there's a more formal term. \n\nAnother possibility is \"ethical compliance,\" but compliance usually refers to adhering to laws and regulations, which might be narrower than managing ethical issues. \"Business ethics\" is a field of study, so that might not fit. \n\nWait, there's also \"ethics program\" or \"ethics initiative,\" but the sentence mentions policies, practices, and programs as tools, so the term should be broader. Maybe \"ethical governance\"? Governance relates to management structures, but I'm not sure if that's the standard term.\n\nAlternatively, \"ethics and compliance program\" is a term used in organizations, but again, the blank seems to require a single term. Let me recall some business terminology. Oh, \"corporate ethics\" could be a term, but I think the more precise term might be \"ethics management.\" However, I've heard the term \"ethical management\" used as well. \n\nWait, another angle: the question mentions both formal and informal methods. So maybe the term is \"ethical leadership,\" but leadership is more about the behavior of individuals rather than policies and programs. \n\nAlternatively, \"organizational ethics\" refers to how organizations handle ethical issues, which includes policies and programs. But I'm not sure if that's the exact term. \n\nLet me check the components again. The key elements are managing ethical issues through policies, practices, and programs. The term should encapsulate a structured approach. \"Ethics management\" seems to fit here. But I also remember that \"ethics management\" can sometimes be referred to as \"ethical infrastructure,\" but that's less common. \n\nWait, another possibility: \"corporate ethics program\" is a specific thing, but the sentence is using \"programmes\" (British spelling) as part of the methods, so the blank is the overarching concept. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethics and compliance\" is a department in some companies, but again, the question is looking for the term that describes the attempt to manage ethical issues through these methods. \n\nWait, maybe \"ethical risk management\"? But that's more about identifying and mitigating risks. \n\nHmm. Let me think of academic terms. In business ethics literature, the term \"ethics management\" is used to describe the process of implementing policies and practices to address ethical concerns. For example, some sources refer to ethics management systems or ethics management programs. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethical auditing\" is a process, but that's a specific activity rather than the overall attempt. \n\nWait, the sentence starts with \"the direct attempt to formally or informally manage ethical issues...\" So the term is the name for this attempt. The answer might be \"Ethics management.\" But I want to be sure. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes this is called \"corporate ethics,\" but that's more general. Or \"ethical governance,\" but governance is part of it. \n\nWait, the term \"ethics program\" is used when companies establish specific initiatives, but the question is asking for the broader concept that includes policies, practices, and programs. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethical culture\" is about the environment, but culture is more about shared values rather than the direct attempt through policies. \n\nWait, the definition given in the question seems to align with \"ethics management.\" Let me verify. If I search for \"ethics management definition,\" I find that it refers to the process of managing ethics within an organization through policies, training, and programs. That seems to fit. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethical management\" could be the term, but \"ethics management\" is more commonly used in literature. \n\nAnother possibility: \"Ethical compliance programs,\" but again, the blank is a single term. \n\nWait, the answer might be \"Ethics management.\" Let me check again. The sentence structure: \"_______ is the direct attempt...\" So it's a noun phrase. \"Ethics management\" is a noun phrase that refers to the systematic approach to handling ethical issues through various means. \n\nYes, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, \"Ethical management,\" but \"ethics management\" is more precise. \n\nWait, but sometimes \"ethics management\" and \"ethical management\" are used interchangeably, but \"ethics management\" is more about managing ethics as a subject, while \"ethical management\" refers to managing in an ethical way. The question is about managing ethical issues, so \"ethics management\" would be the process of managing those issues. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely \"Ethics management.\""
