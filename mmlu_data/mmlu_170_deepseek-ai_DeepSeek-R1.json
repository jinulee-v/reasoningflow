    },
    "raw_text": {
        "question": "What types of force does Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibit?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what types of force Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits. Let me start by recalling what I know about the UN Charter. Article 2(4) is a key part of international law related to the use of force between states.\n\nFirst, I should probably remember the exact wording of Article 2(4). From what I remember, it says something like all members shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. So, it's not just about using force, but also threatening it. The main idea is to prevent wars and aggression between countries.\n\nNow, the question is about the types of force prohibited. The article mentions \"the threat or use of force.\" So, threats are included, not just actual use. But what counts as \"force\" here? Is it only military force, or does it include economic coercion or other forms? I think traditionally, it's been interpreted as armed force or military action. For example, invading another country's territory would clearly violate this. But what about cyber attacks or economic sanctions?\n\nI recall that there's been some debate among international law scholars about whether non-military forms of coercion are included. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has addressed this in some cases. In the Nicaragua v. United States case, they said that the prohibition applies to the use of armed force, but other forms of intervention (like economic or political) might be covered under other principles, like non-intervention. So, maybe Article 2(4) is specifically about military force.\n\nBut then, there's also the concept of \"threat of force.\" For example, if a country mobilizes troops near another's border in a threatening manner, that could be considered a threat of force prohibited by 2(4). Also, blockades are generally seen as a use of force. What about things like supporting rebel groups in another country? The ICJ in the Nicaragua case considered that providing arms and logistical support to insurgents could amount to a use of force, especially if it's a substantial involvement.\n\nAnother point is the exceptions. There are cases where the use of force is allowed, like self-defense under Article 51 or when authorized by the UN Security Council under Chapter VII. So Article 2(4) isn't an absolute prohibition; there are exceptions. But the question is about what's prohibited, not the exceptions.\n\nSo, to sum up, Article 2(4) prohibits both the threat and use of military force against another state's territorial integrity or political independence. This includes direct military actions like invasions, bombardments, blockades, and possibly indirect actions like arming rebels. Threats, such as ultimatums backed by force, are also prohibited. However, economic coercion or political pressure might not fall under this article unless they involve the threat of military force. Cyber attacks that result in physical damage might be considered a use of force, but this is still a developing area in international law.\n\nWait, but some sources argue that the scope of Article 2(4) could be broader. For example, if economic sanctions are so severe that they threaten the political independence of a state, maybe that's covered. But I think the majority view is that it's limited to armed force. The wording of the Charter uses \"force\" without qualification, but state practice and opinions have generally treated it as military in nature.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\" might imply that even if force is used without affecting territorial integrity or political independence, it's still prohibited. The ICJ in the Corfu Channel case mentioned that the use of force is prohibited regardless of its purpose. So even if a state doesn't intend to take territory or undermine independence, any use of force is prohibited unless it falls under an exception.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Article 2(4) prohibits any threat or use of military force by a state against another state. This includes direct military attacks, indirect actions like supporting armed groups, blockades, and threats of such actions. Non-military coercion is generally not covered here but might be addressed under other international law principles."
