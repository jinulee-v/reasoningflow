        "response": "As of 2017, approximately 86% of the world's 1-year-old children have been vaccinated against some disease. This percentage is based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) immunization coverage estimates, which indicate that around 116.5 million children received the recommended three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine, which is a key indicator of immunization coverage. However, it is important to note that vaccination rates can vary significantly by country and region, and there are still many children who do not receive the necessary vaccinations."
