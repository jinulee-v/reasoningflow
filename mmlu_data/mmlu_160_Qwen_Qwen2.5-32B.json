        "question": "Which of the following persons is more likely to remain at home alone, as of 2019?",
        "response": "To determine which person is more likely to remain at home alone in 2019, we need to consider factors such as age, marital status, and living arrangements. Here are some general trends based on demographic data from that year:\n\n1. **Age**: Older adults (typically those aged 65 and above) are more likely to live alone due to factors like widowhood or being single. Younger individuals (under 30) might also live alone but often for different reasons such as pursuing education or career opportunities.\n\n2. **Marital Status**: Single or divorced individuals are more likely to live alone compared to married couples who usually share a household.\n\n3. **Living Arrangements**: People who own their homes or have independent living situations are more likely to remain at home alone compared to those living with family members or in shared accommodations.\n\nGiven these factors, an older adult who is single or widowed and owns their own home would be more likely to remain at home alone in 2019. This demographic tends to have fewer obligations to others and may prefer the independence of living alone."
