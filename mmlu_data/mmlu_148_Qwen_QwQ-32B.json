        "question": "A new smartwatch is manufactured in one part of a factory, then secured for shipping in another, independent part of the factory. The weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging (box, user's guide, bubble wrap, etc.) has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Together, the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation:",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the mean and standard deviation of the combined weight of the smartwatch and its packaging. Let me start by recalling what I know about combining random variables. \n\nFirst, the problem says the smartwatch has a mean weight of 62 grams with a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The packaging has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. They are manufactured in different parts of the factory, so I guess they're independent? The question mentions they are independent parts, so that probably means the weights are independent random variables. \n\nAlright, so when you add two independent random variables, their means add up. That part seems straightforward. So the mean of the total weight should just be the mean of the smartwatch plus the mean of the packaging. Let me write that down:\n\nMean_total = Mean_smartwatch + Mean_packaging\nMean_total = 62 + 456\n\nHmm, 62 plus 456. Let me do that math. 62 + 400 is 462, and then +56 more would be 518? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 456 + 60 is 516, plus 2 more is 518. Yeah, that's correct. So the mean total weight is 518 grams. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow for the standard deviation. I remember that when you add two independent random variables, the variances add. So the variance of the total is the variance of the smartwatch plus the variance of the packaging. Then you take the square root of that to get the standard deviation. Let me confirm that. \n\nStandard deviation is the square root of variance, so if they are independent, Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y). Therefore, SD_total = sqrt(Var_smartwatch + Var_packaging). \n\nFirst, let me compute the variances. The variance of the smartwatch is (standard deviation)^2, so that's 1.0^2 = 1.0. The variance of the packaging is 6^2 = 36. \n\nAdding those variances together: 1.0 + 36 = 37. Then the standard deviation is the square root of 37. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(37) is somewhere between 6 and 7. Let me see, 6.08 squared is 36.96, which is close to 37. Wait, 6.08 squared is actually 6*6.08 + 0.08*6.08? Wait, maybe better to do 6.08^2:\n\n6.08 * 6.08: 6*6 = 36, 6*0.08 = 0.48, 0.08*6 = 0.48, and 0.08*0.08 = 0.0064. So adding those up: 36 + 0.48 + 0.48 + 0.0064 = 36 + 0.96 + 0.0064 = 36.9664. That's 6.08 squared is 36.9664, which is just a bit less than 37. So maybe 6.082? Let me check 6.082^2:\n\n6.08^2 is 36.9664, then adding 0.002 more to 6.08 gives 6.082. The difference would be (6.08 + 0.002)^2 = 6.08^2 + 2*6.08*0.002 + (0.002)^2 \u2248 36.9664 + 0.02432 + 0.000004 \u2248 36.9907. Still not quite 37. Hmm, maybe 6.08276? Let me see, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08276253. So roughly 6.08 grams. \n\nBut maybe the question expects an exact answer in terms of sqrt(37), but since they gave the standard deviations as decimals, maybe they want a decimal approximation? Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem says \"the following mean and standard deviation\". It doesn't specify whether to approximate or leave it in radical form. Hmm. Since the original standard deviations are given as 1.0 and 6, which are exact, but the answer might need to be in decimal. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they just want the variance added and square-rooted, so sqrt(37). But 37 is a prime number, so it can't be simplified. So perhaps they want the exact value, sqrt(37), but maybe rounded to one decimal place? Let me see the options. Wait, actually, the problem is presented as a question expecting an answer, so maybe I should just compute sqrt(37) numerically. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, let me confirm again. The standard deviation of the sum of two independent variables is sqrt(\u03c31\u00b2 + \u03c32\u00b2). So yes, that's correct. So 1 squared plus 6 squared is 1 + 36 = 37. So sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08 grams. \n\nBut let me check if the question is perhaps asking for the standard deviation of the combined distribution. Since they are independent, yes, that formula holds. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, is there any chance that the variance could be different? For example, if they were dependent, but the problem says the two parts are independent. So variance addition is correct. \n\nTherefore, the mean is 518 grams, and the standard deviation is sqrt(37) grams, approximately 6.08 grams. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. The question says \"the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation\". So they probably want the numerical values. Since the mean is straightforward, 62 + 456 = 518. The standard deviation is sqrt(1^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(37). Since sqrt(37) is an irrational number, maybe they want it as a decimal? Let me see if 6.08 is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want an exact answer. Let me see, sqrt(37) is about 6.082, so if rounded to one decimal place, that would be 6.1. But the original standard deviations are given to one decimal place (1.0 and 6.0). Hmm, 1.0 has one decimal, 6 is a whole number. Maybe they want the standard deviation to one decimal place? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact answer in terms of sqrt(37). But since the question is presented in a context where they might expect a numerical answer, maybe 6.1? Let me see. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again. The smartwatch has a standard deviation of 1.0 grams, which is precise to the tenths place. The packaging has a standard deviation of 6 grams, which is a whole number. So when adding variances, 1.0^2 is 1.0, and 6^2 is 36. So total variance is 37.0. Then the standard deviation is sqrt(37.0). \n\nSince 1.0 has one decimal place, but variance is 1.0 (so one decimal), but 6 is an integer, so variance is 36.0. So total variance is 37.0. Then sqrt(37.0) is approximately 6.082. Since the original standard deviations were given to one decimal place (1.0) and a whole number (6), perhaps the answer should be given to one decimal place as well. So 6.1 grams. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want two decimal places? Hmm. The problem doesn't specify, but in many cases, when combining standard deviations, you can present it to one more decimal place than the original data. Since the original standard deviations are given to one decimal (1.0) and none (6), maybe one decimal is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact answer, so sqrt(37). But in the context of an exam question like AP or SAT, they might prefer the decimal. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the mean? Let me check again. 62 + 456. 62 + 400 is 462, plus 56 is 518. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the mean is definitely 518. The standard deviation is sqrt(37). Since sqrt(36) is 6, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(37) is about 6.08. \n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way. Maybe the question is trying to trick me? Like, maybe the packaging is subtracted or something? But no, the problem says \"the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging\", so it's the sum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are considering the total weight as smartwatch plus packaging, so addition is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is mean 518 grams and standard deviation sqrt(37) grams, approximately 6.08 grams. Since the problem might want the exact value, but given the answer options (if this is multiple choice) but since it's open response, maybe write both? Wait, the user just says \"the following mean and standard deviation\" so probably expects the numbers. Since the question is presented in a way that expects boxed answers, likely as numbers. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again. The user hasn't given options, just says \"the following mean and standard deviation\" so probably expects the numerical values. Since the mean is 518, and the standard deviation is sqrt(37). But sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08. Since the original standard deviations are given as 1.0 and 6, which are precise to tenths and whole numbers, so maybe 6.1 is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an exact answer, so sqrt(37). But in most cases, standard deviation is reported as a decimal. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the variance addition. Wait, variance of sum is sum of variances only when independent. Since they are independent, yes. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in grams, so units are grams. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is mean 518 grams and standard deviation sqrt(37) grams, which is approximately 6.08 grams. Since the problem might want the exact value, but given the initial data has 1.0 and 6, which are exact, but sqrt(37) is irrational. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the standard deviation to be 6.1 grams. Let me see. Since 6.08 is closer to 6.1 than 6.0. Since 0.08 is 8 hundredths, so 6.08 is 6.1 when rounded to the nearest tenth. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want it as sqrt(37). But in most cases, unless specified, they might want the decimal. Let me check with approximate value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from an AP stats exam, where they often prefer to keep it as sqrt(37). Wait, but in the free response, they might need a decimal. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should present both. But the problem says \"the following mean and standard deviation\", so probably expects the numbers. Since the mean is exact, 518, and the standard deviation is sqrt(37). But sqrt(37) is about 6.08. Since the problem gives the standard deviations as 1.0 and 6, which are precise to tenths and whole numbers, so maybe 6.1 is the right way to present it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an exact answer, so sqrt(37). Let me see. If I were to write this in a box, maybe they want sqrt(37). But the problem says \"the following mean and standard deviation\", so perhaps they just want the numbers. Since the mean is 518, and the standard deviation is sqrt(37). But maybe they want it as a decimal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check with the variance. Let me see. \n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when combining variables, if they are independent, the standard deviation is sqrt(\u03c31\u00b2 + \u03c32\u00b2). So that's correct. So 1 squared plus 6 squared is 37, so sqrt(37). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to add the standard deviations directly? Which would be wrong, but maybe someone might think that. But no, that's a common mistake. The correct way is to add variances. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 518 and sqrt(37). Since sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08, but maybe they want the exact value. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a textbook question where the answer is presented as sqrt(37). Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write both. The problem says \"the following mean and standard deviation\", so probably expects the numerical values. Since the mean is 518, and the standard deviation is sqrt(37). But sqrt(37) is about 6.08. Since the problem gave the standard deviations as 1.0 and 6, which are precise to tenths and whole numbers, so maybe 6.1 is the right way to present it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact answer, so sqrt(37). Hmm. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again. The problem says \"the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation\". Since they are asking for the parameters of the distribution, which is the sum of two independent variables, so the mean is the sum, and the variance is the sum of variances. Therefore, the standard deviation is sqrt(1^2 + 6^2) = sqrt(37). \n\nTherefore, unless they want a decimal approximation, the exact answer is sqrt(37). But given that the original standard deviations are given as decimals, maybe they want a decimal. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an exam where they want the answer as sqrt(37). But in most cases, standard deviation is given as a decimal. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write both. The mean is 518 grams, and the standard deviation is approximately 6.1 grams. But since the problem didn't specify, maybe they just want the exact value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with the variance. Let me see. \n\nWait, another thought: the problem says \"the weight of the smartwatch\" and \"the weight of the packaging\". So when combined, it's the total weight, which is the sum of the two. Since they are independent, the variance is additive. \n\nTherefore, the standard deviation is sqrt(1 + 36) = sqrt(37). \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is mean 518 and standard deviation sqrt(37). Since sqrt(37) is an irrational number, but maybe they want it in the box as sqrt(37). Alternatively, if they want a decimal, 6.08. \n\nWait, the problem might have options, but since it's presented as an open question, perhaps the user expects me to write both. But the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". So probably two boxed answers? Wait, the original problem says \"the following mean and standard deviation\", so maybe they want both in boxes? \n\nWait, the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Maybe they want both in separate boxes? Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem says \"the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nHmm, so maybe they want both numbers in a single box, separated by a comma or something? Or two boxes? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an exam where the answer is two numbers, so they need to be boxed separately. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects me to write the mean and standard deviation each in their own box. \n\nGiven that, I think I should present both answers boxed. Since the question is asking for both mean and standard deviation. \n\nTherefore, the mean is 518 grams, and the standard deviation is sqrt(37) grams. Since sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08, but maybe they want the exact value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the standard deviation to be 6.1. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write both. Let me see. \n\nWait, let me check with the variance again. \n\nVariance_smartwatch = 1^2 = 1\n\nVariance_packaging = 6^2 = 36\n\nTotal variance = 1 + 36 = 37\n\nStandard deviation = sqrt(37) \u2248 6.08276253\n\nSo, if rounded to one decimal place, that's 6.1. Since the original standard deviations were given to one decimal (1.0) and a whole number (6), so 6.1 is appropriate. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is mean 518 and standard deviation approximately 6.1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact answer, so sqrt(37). But in most cases, when given standard deviations as decimals, they expect the answer in decimals. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from the SAT or AP, where they might prefer the exact radical form. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check an example. For instance, if you have two independent variables with SD 1 and 6, then the combined SD is sqrt(37). So in an AP stats exam, they might write the answer as sqrt(37), but in a more applied context, they might use the decimal. \n\nSince the problem mentions \"the following mean and standard deviation\", and given that the mean is an exact number (518), the standard deviation is sqrt(37). Since sqrt(37) is an exact value, maybe that's acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer as sqrt(37). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should present both. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the following mean and standard deviation\", so maybe they just want the numbers. Since the mean is 518, and the standard deviation is sqrt(37). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a textbook where the answer is sqrt(37). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go with the exact value. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives the standard deviations as 1.0 and 6, which are precise to tenths and whole numbers, so the standard deviation of the total should be given to the nearest tenth. \n\nTherefore, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.082, which rounds to 6.1. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is mean 518 and standard deviation 6.1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the standard deviation to be 6.08. But since 1.0 has one decimal, and 6 has none, perhaps one decimal is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as sqrt(37). \n\nHmm. Since the problem didn't specify, but in most statistical contexts, when combining standard deviations, you can present it as a decimal. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 518 and approximately 6.1. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Suppose I have two independent variables X and Y. Then Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y). So SD(X + Y) = sqrt(Var(X) + Var(Y)). \n\nTherefore, the standard deviation is sqrt(1 + 36) = sqrt(37). \n\nTherefore, the exact answer is sqrt(37). \n\nBut since the problem might want a numerical value, so sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want it as 6.08. \n\nAlternatively, since 1.0 is precise to tenths, and 6 is precise to ones, so the least precise is ones, so maybe the standard deviation should be to the nearest whole number? But that would be 6. But that seems too rough. \n\nAlternatively, since the smartwatch's standard deviation is given to tenths, so maybe we can keep one decimal. \n\nTherefore, sqrt(37) \u2248 6.08, so 6.1 when rounded to the tenths place. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 518 and 6.1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact value. \n\nHmm. Since the problem is presented neutrally, I think the best approach is to present both the exact value and the approximate decimal. But since the user wants the final answer in boxed, maybe they want both numbers boxed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the standard deviation as sqrt(37). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the problem's source. Wait, since it's a user-submitted problem, I can't. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives the standard deviations as 1.0 and 6, which are exact, so the variance is exactly 1 and 36, so the total variance is exactly 37, so the standard deviation is exactly sqrt(37). Therefore, the answer is mean 518 and standard deviation sqrt(37). \n\nTherefore, I think that's the answer they are looking for. \n\nTherefore, I will write the mean as 518 and the standard deviation as sqrt(37). \n\nBut let me check once more. \n\nYes, the mean is additive, so 62 + 456 = 518. \n\nThe variance is additive for independent variables, so 1^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 36 = 37. \n\nTherefore, standard deviation is sqrt(37). \n\nTherefore, the answer is mean 518, standard deviation sqrt(37). \n\nAlternatively, if they want decimals, sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify, but in mathematical terms, sqrt(37) is exact. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 518 and sqrt(37). \n\nTherefore, I will present both in boxed form. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean is \\boxed{518} grams and the standard deviation is \\boxed{\\sqrt{37}} grams.\n\nAlternatively, if they want the standard deviation as a decimal, it would be approximately \\boxed{6.1} grams. But since the problem didn't specify, I think the exact form is better. \n\nWait, but maybe the question expects both in one box? The problem says \"the following mean and standard deviation\", so maybe they want both in one box separated by a comma. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem says \"the distribution of the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging would have the following mean and standard deviation: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nHmm, so maybe they want both numbers in a single box. Like \\boxed{518} and \\boxed{6.1} or \\boxed{\\sqrt{37}}. But the instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", so maybe two boxes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want it as a pair. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects two boxed answers. \n\nGiven that, I think safest to present both boxed separately. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean is \\boxed{518} grams and the standard deviation is \\boxed{\\sqrt{37}} grams.\n\nAlternatively, if decimal is needed, \\boxed{6.1}. But since sqrt(37) is exact, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe mean is \\boxed{518} and the standard deviation is \\boxed{\\sqrt{37}}.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of the smartwatch has a mean of 62 grams and a standard deviation of 1.0 grams. The weight of the packaging has a mean of 456 grams and a standard deviation of 6 grams. Since the weights are independent, we can combine their means and variances.\n\n1. **Mean Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Mean}_{\\text{total}} = \\text{Mean}_{\\text{smartwatch}} + \\text{Mean}_{\\text{packaging}} = 62 + 456 = 518\n   \\]\n\n2. **Standard Deviation Calculation**:\n   - Variance of the smartwatch: \\( \\sigma_{\\text{smartwatch}}^2 = 1.0^2 = 1.0 \\)\n   - Variance of the packaging: \\( \\sigma_{\\text{packaging}}^2 = 6^2 = 36 \\)\n   - Total variance: \\( \\sigma_{\\text{total}}^2 = 1.0 + 36 = 37 \\)\n   - Standard deviation: \\( \\sigma_{\\text{total}} = \\sqrt{37} \\)\n\nThus, the mean and standard deviation of the combined weight are:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\boxed{518}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Standard Deviation} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{37}}\n\\]"
