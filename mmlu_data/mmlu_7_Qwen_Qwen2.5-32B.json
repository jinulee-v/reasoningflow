        "question": "The pleura",
        "response": "The pleura is a thin, double-layered membrane that covers the lungs and lines the inside of the chest cavity. It consists of two layers: the visceral pleura, which is attached to the surface of the lungs, and the parietal pleura, which lines the inner surface of the chest wall, diaphragm, and mediastinum. The space between these two layers is called the pleural cavity, which contains a small amount of lubricating fluid that helps reduce friction as the lungs expand and contract during breathing. The pleura plays a crucial role in facilitating the smooth movement of the lungs within the chest cavity and protecting the lungs from damage."
