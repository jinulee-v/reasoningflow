        "correct_answer": "Coercive diplomacy constitutes the threats of limited force to induce adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is an influence strategy that is intended to obtain compliance: the use of force to defeat an opponent first does not count. It leaves an element of choice with the target to comply, or to continue."

        "question": "What distinguishes coercive diplomacy from military force?",
        "response": "Coercive diplomacy is a strategy that involves the use of threats, economic sanctions, and other non-military means to achieve a desired outcome. It is a form of diplomacy that seeks to influence the behavior of another state or actor through the use of force, but without resorting to actual military action. Military force, on the other hand, involves the use of armed forces to achieve a desired outcome, and is often used as a last resort when other means of diplomacy have failed."
