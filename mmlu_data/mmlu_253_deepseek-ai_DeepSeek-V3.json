        "question": "Carl Jung believed that a client's transference:",
        "response": "Carl Jung believed that a client's transference was a crucial and natural phenomenon in the therapeutic process, but he viewed it differently than Sigmund Freud. While Freud saw transference primarily as the projection of unresolved feelings and conflicts from past relationships (especially with parents) onto the therapist, Jung expanded this concept to include a broader, more symbolic dimension.\n\nFor Jung, transference was not just about projecting personal, unconscious material onto the therapist but also about the activation of archetypal images and patterns from the collective unconscious. He believed that the therapist could become a symbolic figure, such as a wise elder, healer, or even a divine figure, representing aspects of the client's psyche that needed to be integrated for psychological growth.\n\nJung saw transference as an opportunity for the client to confront and work through unconscious material, both personal and collective, in the context of the therapeutic relationship. He emphasized the importance of the therapist's role in helping the client understand and integrate these projections, rather than simply interpreting them as distortions of reality. This process, Jung believed, could lead to greater self-awareness, individuation, and psychological wholeness."
