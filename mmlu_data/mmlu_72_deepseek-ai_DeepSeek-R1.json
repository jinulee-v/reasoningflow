        "question": "The coil of a moving coil meter has 100 turns, is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. The control torque is 240*10-6 N-m on full scale. If magnetic flux density is 1Wb/m2 range of meter is",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the range of a moving coil meter. The given parameters are: number of turns N = 100, coil dimensions 40 mm long and 30 mm wide, control torque at full scale is 240\u00d710^-6 N\u00b7m, and the magnetic flux density B is 1 Wb/m\u00b2. Hmm, right. So, the range of the meter would be the current that causes the coil to experience a torque equal to the control torque, which I think is the full-scale deflection current. \n\nFirst, I remember that the torque in a moving coil meter is given by the formula T = N \u00d7 B \u00d7 A \u00d7 I, where N is the number of turns, B is the magnetic flux density, A is the area of the coil, and I is the current. The control torque is the restoring torque provided by the spring, which counteracts the magnetic torque. At full scale deflection, these two torques are equal. So, setting the magnetic torque equal to the control torque should give me the full-scale current, which is the meter's range.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. First, calculate the area A of the coil. The coil is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. Wait, in a moving coil meter, the coil is usually rectangular, so the area would be length times width. But I need to convert those millimeters to meters since the flux density is in Wb/m\u00b2. \n\nSo, length l = 40 mm = 0.04 m, and width w = 30 mm = 0.03 m. Therefore, area A = l \u00d7 w = 0.04 m \u00d7 0.03 m = 0.0012 m\u00b2. Let me check that: 0.04 times 0.03 is 0.0012. Yep, that's right.\n\nNext, plug into the torque formula. The torque T is given as 240\u00d710^-6 N\u00b7m. So, T = N \u00d7 B \u00d7 A \u00d7 I. We need to solve for I. Rearranging the formula: I = T / (N \u00d7 B \u00d7 A). \n\nSubstituting the known values: I = 240\u00d710^-6 / (100 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.0012). Let me compute the denominator first: 100 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.0012 = 0.12. Then, 240\u00d710^-6 divided by 0.12. \n\nCalculating that: 240\u00d710^-6 is 0.00024. So, 0.00024 / 0.12 = 0.002. So, 0.002 A, which is 2 mA. \n\nWait, that seems low. Let me verify. If the torque is 240 micro N\u00b7m, and with 100 turns, flux density 1 T, area 0.0012 m\u00b2. So, torque per current is N\u00d7B\u00d7A = 100\u00d71\u00d70.0012 = 0.12 N\u00b7m/A. Then, torque T = 0.12 \u00d7 I. So, solving for I gives I = T / 0.12 = 240e-6 / 0.12 = 0.002 A. Yeah, that's 2 mA. \n\nHmm, 2 mA full scale deflection. So, the range of the meter is 2 mA. Is that correct? Let me think again. The formula seems right. Torque equation for moving coil galvanometer is indeed T = NBAI. So, yes, solving for I gives T/(NBA). \n\nSo, unless there's a mistake in the area calculation. Wait, the coil dimensions: 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. Is the length the side of the coil in the magnetic field? Wait, in a moving coil meter, the coil is suspended in a radial magnetic field so that the plane of the coil is always parallel to the magnetic field. The torque is calculated as N B I A, where A is the area of the coil. So, yes, length and width are the dimensions of the coil. So converting them to meters is correct. 40 mm is 0.04 m, 30 mm is 0.03 m. Area is 0.04*0.03=0.0012 m\u00b2. \n\nSo, denominator N*B*A is 100*1*0.0012=0.12. Torque is 240e-6 N\u00b7m. So, 240e-6 /0.12=0.002 A=2 mA. That seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the range of the meter is 2 mA. So, the answer should be 2 mA. \n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, sometimes in these problems, the length and width might refer to different things. Wait, in some contexts, the \"length\" of the coil could refer to the length of the side that's perpendicular to the magnetic field, which would affect the torque. But in a moving coil meter, the magnetic field is radial, so that the plane of the coil is always parallel to the field, which makes the torque independent of the rotation angle. Wait, actually, in a moving coil meter, the magnetic field is designed to be radial so that the torque is always N B I A regardless of the coil's rotation. Therefore, the formula T = N B I A holds. \n\nTherefore, the calculation should be correct. So, the full-scale current is 2 mA, so the meter's range is 2 mA. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the voltage range? But no, the problem says \"range of meter\" without specifying, but given that it's a moving coil meter, which is typically an ammeter or galvanometer, and since we're given the torque related to current, it's most likely asking for the current range. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 2 mA. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe range of the meter is \\boxed{2 \\, \\text{mA}}."
