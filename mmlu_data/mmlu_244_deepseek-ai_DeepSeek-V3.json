        "question": "A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?",
        "response": "The most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement is based on the **doctrine of promissory estoppel** and the **existence of a unilateral contract**.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Unilateral Contract**: The father\u2019s promise to pay $500 per month for 10 months to satisfy the son\u2019s debt can be viewed as a unilateral contract. A unilateral contract is formed when one party makes a promise in exchange for the other party\u2019s performance. Here, the father\u2019s promise was made in exchange for the creditor\u2019s forbearance from suing the son, even though the creditor did not explicitly promise to forbear.\n\n2. **Promissory Estoppel**: Even if there was no explicit agreement, the creditor relied on the father\u2019s promise to their detriment by refraining from taking legal action against the son for five months. Promissory estoppel applies when:\n   - A promise is made.\n   - The promisee (creditor) reasonably relies on the promise.\n   - The reliance results in a detriment to the promisee.\n   - Enforcement of the promise is necessary to avoid injustice.\n\n   In this case, the creditor\u2019s forbearance from suing the son constitutes detrimental reliance on the father\u2019s promise.\n\n3. **Performance and Acceptance**: The father made five payments of $500, and the creditor accepted them, which demonstrates the creditor\u2019s reliance on the father\u2019s promise. This partial performance further supports the existence of a binding agreement.\n\n4. **Breach of Agreement**: By ceasing payments after five months, the father breached the agreement. The creditor can argue that the father is liable for the remaining $2,500 ($500 x 5 months) based on the terms of the agreement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe father is likely liable to the creditor because his promise to pay $500 per month for 10 months induced the creditor to forbear from suing the son, and the creditor\u2019s reliance on this promise was reasonable and detrimental. The father\u2019s failure to complete the payments constitutes a breach of the agreement, making him liable for the remaining amount."
