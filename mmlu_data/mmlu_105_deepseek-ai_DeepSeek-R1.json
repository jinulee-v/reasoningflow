        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which Enlightenment philosopher designed a system of checks and balances for government. The question is referring to the pamphlet by Thomas Paine, but the actual answer isn't directly in the text provided. Let me recall what I know about Enlightenment thinkers and their contributions.\n\nFirst, the main Enlightenment philosophers include people like John Locke, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, and maybe others like Hobbes or Kant. The system of checks and balances is a key part of the United States government structure, which was influenced by these thinkers. I remember that Montesquieu wrote \"The Spirit of the Laws\" where he discussed the separation of powers into legislative, executive, and judicial branches. He argued that these should be separate to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. That sounds like checks and balances. \n\nJohn Locke is more known for his ideas on natural rights (life, liberty, property) and social contract theory. Voltaire was big on freedom of speech and religion. Rousseau talked about the general will and direct democracy. Hobbes believed in a strong central authority to avoid the state of nature being chaotic. \n\nSo, putting this together, Montesquieu's separation of powers is the basis for checks and balances. The US Constitution later incorporated this idea, ensuring each branch can check the others. Therefore, the answer should be Montesquieu. Let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up any other philosophers. Yeah, Locke influenced the executive and legislative separation too, but Montesquieu is specifically credited with the checks and balances through separated branches. Definitely Montesquieu."
