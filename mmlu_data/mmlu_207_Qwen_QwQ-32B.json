        "question": "Who is the shortest man to ever win an NBA slam dunk competition?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out who the shortest man to ever win an NBA Slam Dunk Competition is. Let me start by recalling what I know about the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. It's part of the NBA All-Star Weekend, right? Players perform various dunks, and they're scored by a panel of judges. The winner is the one with the highest score.\n\nFirst, I should think about some notable winners. I know that there have been some really tall players who won, like Dominique Wilkins, who's 6'8\", or Zach LaVine, who's 6'6\". But the question is about the shortest. So maybe someone shorter than that?\n\nI remember that Spud Webb won the contest. Wait, wasn't he the shortest player in the NBA at some point? Let me confirm his height. I think he was 5'7\", which is pretty short for an NBA player. If he won the contest, that might be the answer. But I should check if there are any others shorter than him who also won.\n\nLet me think of other winners. There's Nate Robinson, who is 5'9\". He won the contest three times, I believe. Wait, so if he's 5'9\", that's actually taller than Spud Webb's 5'7\". So Spud Webb would be shorter. But I need to make sure that Spud Webb actually won the contest. \n\nWait, Spud Webb won in 1986, right? And Nate Robinson won in 2006, 2009, and 2011. So if Spud Webb is indeed 5'7\", then he would be the shortest. But I should verify his exact height because sometimes sources might differ. Let me think again. Spud Webb was a point guard for the Dallas Mavericks, and he was known for being the shortest player in the NBA at the time. His height is listed as 5 feet 7 inches. \n\nNow, are there any other players shorter than him who won? Let me think of other winners. There's Michael Cooper, who was 6'5\", so taller. Then there's Julius Erving, who was 6'6\", so again taller. So maybe Spud Webb is indeed the shortest. \n\nWait, but I should check if there's any other contestant who was shorter. Let me think of other participants. There's someone like Muggsy Bogues, who was 5'3\", but did he ever win the contest? I don't think so. He was a player but maybe didn't compete in the dunk contest. \n\nAnother name that comes to mind is Nate Robinson, but as mentioned, he's 5'9\", so taller than Webb. So that would make Spud Webb the shortest. \n\nWait, but I should confirm the exact years and details. Spud Webb won in 1986, right? And he was indeed 5'7\". Let me see if there's any other player. Maybe someone from an earlier era? Like maybe someone in the 70s or 60s? But the NBA Slam Dunk Contest started in 1984, so the first contest was in 1984. So prior to that, there wasn't an official NBA contest. So the first winners would be from 1984 onwards. \n\nIn 1984, the winner was Larry Nance, who is 6'9\", so that's tall. Then in 1985, it was Darrell Griffith, 6'6\". Then 1986 Spud Webb. So that's the first three years. So Spud Webb is the first one who was significantly shorter. \n\nTherefore, unless there's another winner after that who is shorter than 5'7\", which I don't think exists, Spud Webb would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check Nate Robinson again. He's 5'9\", so that's an inch taller. So Spud Webb at 5'7\" is indeed shorter. \n\nAnother thought: sometimes players' heights can be listed differently. Maybe some sources say Spud Webb is 5'6\"? Let me confirm. A quick check in my mind: most sources say 5'7\". For example, his Wikipedia page probably lists him as 5 feet 7 inches. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Spud Webb. But just to be thorough, are there any other players? Let me think of other dunk contest winners. There's Jason Richardson, 6'6\", so taller. Then there's Jeremy Evans, who is 6'7\", so again taller. \n\nSo yes, Spud Webb at 5'7\" is the shortest. Therefore, the answer is Spud Webb.\n</think>\n\nThe shortest man to ever win an NBA Slam Dunk Competition is **Spud Webb**, who stands at **5 feet 7 inches** tall. He won the contest in **1986**, becoming the first player of his height to achieve this feat. Webb, known for his exceptional vertical leap and creativity, overcame taller competitors to secure the victory, solidifying his legacy as a standout in NBA history despite his diminutive stature. \n\nOther notable short dunk winners include **Nate Robinson** (5'9\"), but he is slightly taller than Webb. No player shorter than Webb has won the competition to date."
