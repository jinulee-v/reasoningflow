        "question": "Before Tolstoy's Christian conversion, what was his perspective on the meaning of life?",
        "response": "Before his Christian conversion, Leo Tolstoy's perspective on the meaning of life was deeply influenced by existential and philosophical questioning, marked by a sense of despair and nihilism. In his autobiographical work *A Confession* (1879), Tolstoy describes this period of his life as one of profound crisis. Despite his immense success as a writer, he felt that life was ultimately meaningless, as it inevitably led to death and oblivion. He questioned the purpose of his achievements, wealth, and fame, realizing that they provided no lasting satisfaction or answer to the fundamental question of existence.\n\nTolstoy's pre-conversion worldview was shaped by a materialistic and rationalist outlook, which he found insufficient to address the deeper spiritual and existential questions he grappled with. He saw life as a cruel and absurd cycle of suffering, with no inherent purpose or ultimate resolution. This existential despair led him to contemplate suicide, as he could not find a rational justification for continuing to live in a world that seemed devoid of meaning.\n\nIt was only after his Christian conversion that Tolstoy found a renewed sense of purpose through his faith, which he articulated in his later writings. His earlier perspective, however, reflects a profound struggle with the human condition and the limitations of a purely secular and materialistic worldview."
