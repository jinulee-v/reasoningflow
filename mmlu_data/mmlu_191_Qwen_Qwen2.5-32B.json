        "question": "Hygiene factors are associated with which writer?",
        "response": "Hygiene factors are associated with the writer Frederick Herzberg, who developed the Two-Factor Theory of motivation in the 1950s. This theory distinguishes between hygiene factors, which are related to the work environment and can cause dissatisfaction if not adequately addressed, and motivators, which are intrinsic to the work itself and can lead to job satisfaction and motivation when present."
