        "question": "In an SR latch built from NOR gates, which condition is not allowed",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which condition is not allowed in an SR latch built from NOR gates. Hmm, let me start by recalling what an SR latch is. From what I remember, an SR latch is a type of flip-flop that has two inputs: Set (S) and Reset (R). It's used to store a bit of data. The term \"latch\" means it's level-sensitive, right? So it changes state based on the input levels when the clock is active.\n\nNow, the question specifies that it's built from NOR gates. Wait, there are two types of SR latches: one made with NOR gates and another with NAND gates. The behavior might be slightly different depending on which gates are used. Let me make sure I'm thinking about the NOR-based one.\n\nIn an SR latch made with NOR gates, the inputs are active-high, I think. So the Set and Reset inputs are active when they are high. The outputs are Q and Q', which are complements of each other. The characteristic equation for an SR latch using NOR gates... Hmm, let me recall. The outputs depend on the current state and the inputs. The equations might be something like Q_next = S + Q', and Q'_next = R + Q. Wait, maybe I should draw the circuit mentally.\n\nAn SR latch with NOR gates has two NOR gates cross-connected. The Set input goes to one input of the first NOR gate, and the other input of that gate is connected to the output of the second NOR gate. Similarly, the Reset input goes to one input of the second NOR gate, and the other input is connected to the output of the first NOR gate. So the outputs Q and Q' are the outputs of the two NOR gates.\n\nLet me think about the truth table. The inputs S and R can be 0 or 1. But since it's a latch, the current state (Q and Q') also affects the next state. The forbidden condition in SR latches is when both S and R are active at the same time, right? Because that would cause a conflict. But wait, in the case of NOR gates, maybe the active states are different?\n\nWait, in a NOR-based SR latch, the inputs S and R are active-high. So if both S and R are 1 (high), then both inputs to the NOR gates would be trying to set conflicting states. Let me see: Suppose S is 1 and R is 1. Then, the first NOR gate has S=1 and the other input is Q', so if Q' is 0 (since Q and Q' are complements), then the output Q would be 0 (since NOR of 1 and 0 is 0). Wait, but then the second NOR gate has R=1 and the other input is Q (which is 0), so its output Q' would be 0 as well. Wait, but that would mean Q and Q' are both 0, which is invalid because they should be complements. So that's the problem. So when both S and R are 1, the latch enters an invalid state where both outputs are 0, which is not allowed. Therefore, that's the forbidden condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go through the possible input combinations. Let's list the possible S and R inputs and see what happens.\n\nCase 1: S=0, R=0. Then, the latch holds its current state. Because the inputs to the NOR gates are 0, so the outputs depend on the other inputs (the cross-connected ones). So if Q was 1 before, then Q' is 0. The first NOR gate has S=0 and Q'=0, so Q remains 1 (since NOR of 0 and 0 is 1? Wait, no, NOR is equivalent to NOT(OR). So OR of 0 and 0 is 0, so NOR is 1. Wait, so if S is 0 and the other input is Q', which is 0, then the output Q is 1. Similarly for the other gate. So yes, when S and R are both 0, the latch holds.\n\nCase 2: S=1, R=0. Then, the Set input is active. The first NOR gate has S=1 and Q'. Let's see, suppose the previous state was Q=0, Q'=1. Then, the first NOR gate would have inputs 1 and 1 (since Q' is 1), so the output Q would be 0. Wait, but that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I need to think step by step.\n\nWait, actually, when S is 1, regardless of the previous state, the output Q should be set to 1. Let me see. Let's suppose S=1 and R=0. The first NOR gate has S=1 and the other input is Q'. Let's say the previous state was Q=0, so Q'=1. Then the first NOR gate's inputs are 1 and 1, so the output Q would be 0. Wait, that's not setting it. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the equations. Let me recall that for a NOR-based SR latch, the equations are:\n\nQ = NOT (S NOR Q') \n\nWait, no, actually, each output is a NOR of the input and the other output. Let me think again. The first NOR gate has inputs S and Q', so Q = NOR(S, Q'). Similarly, the second NOR gate has inputs R and Q, so Q' = NOR(R, Q).\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\nQ = NOT (S OR Q')\n\nQ' = NOT (R OR Q)\n\nHmm, so let's substitute these equations. Let me try S=1, R=0.\n\nSuppose the previous state was Q=0, so Q'=1.\n\nThen, Q_new = NOT (1 OR 1) = NOT(1) = 0. Wait, so Q remains 0? That's not setting it. Hmm, maybe I need to consider that when S is 1, it should set Q to 1 regardless of previous state.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check again. The first NOR gate has inputs S and Q', so Q is the output of that NOR gate. So Q = NOR(S, Q'). Similarly, Q' is the output of the second NOR gate, which has inputs R and Q. So Q' = NOR(R, Q).\n\nTherefore, if S is 1, then Q = NOR(1, Q'). Since NOR is 0 if either input is 1. So if S is 1, then Q will be 0 regardless of Q'. Wait, that can't be right. That would mean setting S high actually forces Q to 0, which is the opposite of what I thought.\n\nWait a second, maybe I got the connections wrong. Maybe in the NOR-based SR latch, the Set input actually sets Q' to 0, thereby setting Q to 1? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard SR latch with NOR gates has active-low inputs? Wait, no, usually when made with NOR gates, the inputs are active-high. Let me check an example.\n\nSuppose the SR latch is constructed with two NOR gates. Let me label the gates as G1 and G2. G1 has inputs S and the output of G2 (which is Q'). The output of G1 is Q. G2 has inputs R and the output of G1 (which is Q), and its output is Q'.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\nQ = NOR(S, Q')\n\nQ' = NOR(R, Q)\n\nSo, if S is 1, then Q = NOR(1, Q'). Since NOR is 0 if either input is 1, so Q will be 0 regardless of Q'. But then Q' = NOR(R, Q). If Q is 0, then Q' = NOR(R, 0). If R is 0, then Q' = NOR(0,0) = 1. So in that case, when S=1 and R=0, Q becomes 0 and Q' becomes 1? Wait, but that would mean setting S high actually resets the latch? That contradicts my previous understanding.\n\nHmm, maybe I have the inputs reversed. Maybe the Set input is actually connected to the other gate? Let me think again. Maybe I mixed up S and R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard SR latch with NOR gates has active-low inputs. Let me see. If the inputs are active-low, then S and R being 0 would set or reset. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose S and R are active-low. Then, when S is 0, it sets Q to 1. Let's see:\n\nIf S=0, R=1 (assuming active-low), then Q = NOR(0, Q'). Since NOR(0, Q') is equivalent to NOT(0 OR Q') = NOT(Q'). So Q = NOT(Q'). Which is just the complement, so that doesn't set anything. Hmm, maybe this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look up the standard truth table for an SR latch made with NOR gates. Wait, since I can't actually look it up, I need to derive it.\n\nLet me try to go through all possible input combinations for S and R (assuming active-high):\n\nCase 1: S=0, R=0. Then, Q = NOR(0, Q'), and Q' = NOR(0, Q). Let's suppose the previous state was Q=1, Q'=0. Then:\n\nQ_new = NOR(0, 0) = 1 (since NOR of 0 and 0 is 1). Wait, but that's the same as before. Similarly, Q'_new = NOR(0,1) = 0. So it holds the state. If previous state was Q=0, then Q'=1. Then Q_new = NOR(0,1)=0, and Q'_new = NOR(0,0)=1. So yes, holds.\n\nCase 2: S=1, R=0. Let's see. Suppose previous Q=0, so Q'=1.\n\nThen Q_new = NOR(1,1) = 0. Q'_new = NOR(0,0)=1. So Q stays 0? Wait, that's not setting. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that when S is 1, it forces Q to 0? But that would be a reset. That contradicts the usual SR latch behavior where S sets Q to 1. Maybe the NOR-based SR latch has inverted functionality?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard SR latch with NOR gates actually has inverted inputs. Let me think again. Maybe the Set input is actually connected to the other input. Wait, perhaps I got the connections wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SR latch made with NOR gates is actually an SR latch with inverted outputs? Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic table is different. Let me try to tabulate all possibilities step by step.\n\nLet me consider all four possible combinations of S and R (0/0, 0/1, 1/0, 1/1), and for each, see what Q and Q' become, given the previous state.\n\nBut since the latch's next state depends on the current state, maybe it's better to consider the possible transitions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the forbidden condition is when both S and R are 1, because that causes both Q and Q' to be 0, which is invalid. Let me check that.\n\nCase 4: S=1, R=1.\n\nThen, Q = NOR(1, Q'), and Q' = NOR(1, Q).\n\nSuppose previous state was Q=1, so Q'=0.\n\nThen Q_new = NOR(1,0)=0, and Q'_new = NOR(1,1)=0. So both Q and Q' become 0, which is invalid because they should be complements. Similarly, if previous state was Q=0, then Q'=1. Then Q_new = NOR(1,1)=0, Q'_new = NOR(1,0)=0. Again, both 0. So that's bad. So when S and R are both 1, the outputs conflict and become 0,0 which is invalid. Therefore, that's the forbidden condition.\n\nIn other cases:\n\nCase 2: S=1, R=0.\n\nLet me take previous Q=0 (so Q'=1). Then:\n\nQ_new = NOR(1,1)=0, Q'_new = NOR(0,0)=1. So Q remains 0. Wait, so setting S=1 doesn't set Q to 1? That's odd. Wait, maybe I need to see another previous state.\n\nSuppose previous Q=1 (so Q'=0). Then:\n\nQ_new = NOR(1,0)=0, Q'_new = NOR(0,1)=0. Wait, that would set Q to 0 and Q' to 0? That's invalid again. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if previous Q was 1, then Q'=0. Then Q_new = NOR(S=1, Q'=0) = NOR(1,0)=0. Then Q'_new = NOR(R=0, Q=1) = NOR(0,1)=0. So both become 0, which is invalid. Wait, so if S=1 and R=0, but previous Q was 1, then it causes an invalid state?\n\nHmm, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's recast the equations again. Let me write them clearly:\n\nQ = NOR(S, Q') = NOT(S OR Q')\n\nQ' = NOR(R, Q) = NOT(R OR Q)\n\nSo, if S=1 and R=0, then:\n\nQ = NOT(1 OR Q') \n\nQ' = NOT(0 OR Q) = NOT(Q)\n\nSo substituting Q' = NOT(Q) into the first equation:\n\nQ = NOT(1 OR NOT(Q)) \n\nLet me solve for Q:\n\nLet me denote Q as x.\n\nThen x = NOT(1 OR NOT(x))\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n1 OR NOT(x) is always 1, because OR with 1 is 1. Therefore, NOT(1) is 0. So x = 0.\n\nTherefore, Q must be 0, and Q' = NOT(Q) = 1. So regardless of the previous state, when S=1 and R=0, Q becomes 0 and Q' becomes 1. Wait, so that's actually a reset? Because Q is set to 0. But in standard SR latches, S is supposed to set Q to 1. Hmm, so maybe in this NOR-based SR latch, the inputs are inverted? Like, S actually resets and R sets? Or maybe the labels are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inputs are active-low. Let me consider that possibility.\n\nSuppose S and R are active-low. So to set Q to 1, you need to set S to 0, and to reset Q to 0, set R to 0.\n\nLet me try that. Let's redo the equations with active-low inputs.\n\nIf S and R are active-low, then when S=0, it's asserting the Set, and R=0 asserts Reset.\n\nSo let's take S=0, R=1 (Set active, Reset inactive). Then:\n\nQ = NOR(S=0, Q') = NOT(0 OR Q') = NOT(Q')\n\nQ' = NOR(R=1, Q) = NOT(1 OR Q) = 0 (since 1 OR anything is 1, so NOT(1)=0)\n\nTherefore, Q' is 0, so Q = NOT(Q') = 1. So that works: setting S low sets Q to 1.\n\nSimilarly, if R=0 and S=1 (Reset active):\n\nQ = NOR(1, Q') = NOT(1 OR Q') = 0\n\nQ' = NOR(0, Q) = NOT(0 OR Q) = NOT(Q)\n\nSo Q is 0, so Q' = NOT(0) = 1. So that resets Q to 0.\n\nIf both S and R are 0 (active), then:\n\nQ = NOR(0, Q') = NOT(0 OR Q') = NOT(Q')\n\nQ' = NOR(0, Q) = NOT(0 OR Q) = NOT(Q)\n\nSo substituting Q' = NOT(Q) into Q's equation:\n\nQ = NOT(Q'), which is the same as Q = Q, which is always true, but also Q' = NOT(Q). So this leads to a contradiction unless Q and Q' are both 0 or both 1. Wait, but if Q = NOT(Q'), then they can't be the same. So if both S and R are 0, then the equations require Q = NOT(Q'), but also Q = NOR(0, Q') = NOT(Q'), so that's consistent. Wait, but then how do we resolve it?\n\nWait, let's plug in:\n\nSuppose S=0 and R=0.\n\nThen Q = NOR(0, Q') = NOT(Q')\n\nQ' = NOR(0, Q) = NOT(Q)\n\nSo substituting Q' = NOT(Q) into the first equation:\n\nQ = NOT(NOT(Q)) = Q. So that's an identity, so it can be any value? But that's not possible. Hmm, maybe in this case, the latch enters an invalid state where both Q and Q' are undefined or in conflict?\n\nWait, if S and R are both 0 (active-low), then both Set and Reset are asserted, which is the forbidden condition. So in this case, the outputs would be conflicting. Let me see:\n\nSuppose previous state was Q=1, Q'=0.\n\nThen with S=0 and R=0:\n\nQ_new = NOR(0, 0) = 1 (since NOR(0,0)=1)\n\nWait, but Q' is NOR(0,1)=0. Wait, so Q remains 1 and Q' remains 0? That's holding?\n\nWait, no, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, if S=0 and R=0,\n\nQ = NOR(S=0, Q') = NOR(0, Q') = NOT(Q')\n\nQ' = NOR(R=0, Q) = NOR(0, Q) = NOT(Q)\n\nSo substituting Q' = NOT(Q) into Q's equation:\n\nQ = NOT(NOT(Q)) = Q. So it's consistent, but doesn't change the state. Wait, so if previous state was Q=1, then Q' is 0, so Q_new = NOT(0)=1, and Q'_new = NOT(1)=0. So it holds. Wait, but that's the same as when S and R are both 1 (if they were active-high). Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to clarify whether the inputs are active-high or active-low in the NOR-based SR latch.\n\nLooking back, in standard SR latches made with NOR gates, the inputs are typically active-high. Wait, but according to some sources I recall, the SR latch made with NOR gates has active-high inputs, but the Set input actually sets Q' to 0, thereby setting Q to 1. Let me try again with active-high inputs.\n\nLet me consider S and R as active-high. So when S is 1, it should set Q to 1, and when R is 1, it resets Q to 0.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf S=1, R=0:\n\nQ = NOR(S=1, Q') = NOT(1 OR Q') = 0 (since OR with 1 is 1, so NOT is 0)\n\nQ' = NOR(R=0, Q) = NOT(0 OR Q) = NOT(Q)\n\nSo Q is 0, so Q' = NOT(0) = 1. So that resets Q to 0. Wait, so S=1 actually resets? That contradicts the usual behavior.\n\nHmm, so maybe in the NOR-based SR latch, the Set and Reset are swapped? Or perhaps the labels are different. Alternatively, maybe the Set input is actually connected to the other gate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the connections wrong. Let me try to redraw the circuit mentally.\n\nThe SR latch with NOR gates: the Set input goes to one input of the first NOR gate, whose output is Q. The other input of that NOR gate is connected to the output of the second NOR gate (Q'). The second NOR gate has the Reset input and the output Q as its inputs, and its output is Q'.\n\nSo the connections are:\n\nG1 (NOR gate): inputs S and Q', output Q.\n\nG2 (NOR gate): inputs R and Q, output Q'.\n\nTherefore, the equations are:\n\nQ = NOR(S, Q') \n\nQ' = NOR(R, Q)\n\nSo, if S is 1 (Set), then Q = NOR(1, Q') = 0, because NOR of 1 and anything is 0. So Q becomes 0, which would mean Q' is 1 (since they are complements). Wait, so setting S high actually sets Q to 0? That would mean that the Set input is actually a Reset? That can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Set input is supposed to set Q to 1, so perhaps the connections are different. Maybe the Set input is connected to the other input?\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the labels. Maybe the Set input is connected to the second gate? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the standard SR latch with NOR gates actually has the Set input connected to the gate that drives Q', so that when S is high, it forces Q' to 0, thereby making Q 1. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the Set input is connected to the second gate's input. Wait, no, the standard cross-coupled NOR latch has the Set connected to the first gate and Reset to the second. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the NOR-based SR latch, the Set and Reset have inverted functions compared to the NAND-based one. Let me recall that in NAND-based SR latches, the inputs are active-low, so S and R low set or reset. In NOR-based, they are active-high, but maybe the functions are inverted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic table is as follows:\n\nFor NOR-based SR latch with active-high inputs:\n\n- S=0, R=0: Hold\n\n- S=1, R=0: Reset (Q=0)\n\n- S=0, R=1: Set (Q=1)\n\n- S=1, R=1: Invalid\n\nWait, that would make sense. So when S is 1, it resets Q to 0, and R=1 sets Q to 1. So the labels are swapped? That might be the case. So in this configuration, the Set input is actually R, and the Reset is S? That would be confusing, but perhaps that's how it's wired.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the labels are correct, but the functions are inverted. So in this case, the forbidden condition is when both S and R are 1, which causes both Q and Q' to be 0, which is invalid. So the answer to the question is that the condition where both S and R are 1 is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking which of the following is not allowed, and the options include things like S=1 and R=1, which is the forbidden one.\n\nSince the question is phrased as \"which condition is not allowed\", and given that in an SR latch (regardless of NOR or NAND), the forbidden condition is when both Set and Reset are active at the same time. In the case of NOR-based, since inputs are active-high, that would be S=1 and R=1. So that's the forbidden condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be when both S and R are 1. So the condition not allowed is S=1 and R=1.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more with equations.\n\nSuppose S=1 and R=1:\n\nThen,\n\nQ = NOR(1, Q') \n\nQ' = NOR(1, Q)\n\nLet me suppose Q was 1 before. Then Q' is 0.\n\nThen Q_new = NOR(1,0)=0\n\nQ'_new = NOR(1,1)=0\n\nSo both become 0, which is invalid.\n\nIf Q was 0 before, then Q'=1.\n\nThen Q_new = NOR(1,1)=0\n\nQ'_new = NOR(1,0)=0\n\nAgain, both 0. So yes, that's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the forbidden condition is S=1 and R=1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is when both S and R are 1. So the condition not allowed is S=1 and R=1.\n\nAlternatively, if the question gives options, but since it's open-ended, the answer is that having both S and R as 1 is not allowed.\n\nSo I think that's the conclusion.\n</think>\n\nIn an SR latch constructed using NOR gates, the **forbidden condition** occurs when **both the Set (S) and Reset (R) inputs are active (high)** simultaneously. This causes a conflict because it forces both outputs \\( Q \\) and \\( \\overline{Q} \\) to be **0**, violating their complementary relationship. \n\n### Key Reasoning:\n1. **NOR Gate Behavior**: A NOR gate outputs **0** if any input is **1**.\n2. **Circuit Configuration**:\n   - \\( Q = \\text{NOR}(S, \\overline{Q}) \\)\n   - \\( \\overline{Q} = \\text{NOR}(R, Q) \\)\n3. **When \\( S = 1 \\) and \\( R = 1 \\)**:\n   - \\( Q = \\text{NOR}(1, \\overline{Q}) = 0 \\) (since \\( 1 \\) dominates the NOR operation).\n   - \\( \\overline{Q} = \\text{NOR}(1, Q) = 0 \\).\n   - This results in \\( Q = 0 \\) and \\( \\overline{Q} = 0 \\), an invalid state.\n\n### Summary:\nThe **not allowed condition** is **\\( S = 1 \\) and \\( R = 1 \\)**. This violates the latch's requirement that \\( Q \\) and \\( \\overline{Q} \\) must always be complements. \n\n**Answer:** The condition where both Set (S) and Reset (R) are **high (1)** is not allowed."
