The Constitution outlines the powers of the President, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of all the powers that the President may exercise. This has led to debates and disagreements over the scope of presidential power, particularly in areas such as foreign policy, national security, and executive privilege. Additionally, the President's power is subject to checks and balances from the other branches of government, which can further complicate the issue of presidential authority."
