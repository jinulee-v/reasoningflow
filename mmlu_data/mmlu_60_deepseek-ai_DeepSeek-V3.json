        "question": "Compared with the mass of a uranium atom undergoing fission, the combined masses of the products after fission are",
        "response": "When a uranium atom undergoes fission, it splits into two or more smaller nuclei, along with a few neutrons and a significant amount of energy. The combined masses of the fission products are **slightly less** than the mass of the original uranium atom.\n\nThis difference in mass, known as the **mass defect**, is converted into energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle, \\( E = mc^2 \\). The energy released during fission is what makes nuclear reactions so powerful.\n\n### Summary:\nThe combined masses of the products after fission are **less** than the mass of the original uranium atom."
