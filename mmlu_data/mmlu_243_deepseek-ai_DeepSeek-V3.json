        "question": "On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely",
        "response": "The court will most likely **grant the mandatory injunction and compel the removal of the librarian's fence** because the fence violates the restrictions imposed by the general development plan.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Enforceability of the Restrictions**:\n   - The general development plan was duly recorded, and the restrictions were imposed on all lots within the development. The restrictions were intended to run with the land, binding all subsequent owners, heirs, assigns, and lessees.\n   - The deeds to the properties in question explicitly referenced the deed book where the general plan was recorded, providing constructive notice of the restrictions to the librarian, the teacher, and the retiree.\n\n2. **Violation of the Restrictions**:\n   - The general plan explicitly prohibits the construction of any house or structure on the 10-foot strip of land reserved for public utility companies (Restriction 23).\n   - The librarian's fence was constructed along the center of this restricted area, directly violating the terms of the general plan.\n\n3. **Legal Remedies**:\n   - The teacher, as an affected party, has standing to seek a mandatory injunction to enforce the restrictions. A mandatory injunction is an appropriate remedy to compel the removal of a structure that violates restrictive covenants.\n   - Courts generally enforce restrictive covenants if they are clear, reasonable, and intended to run with the land, as is the case here.\n\n4. **Precedent**:\n   - Courts have consistently upheld the enforcement of restrictive covenants when they are properly recorded and provide notice to subsequent purchasers. The librarian had constructive notice of the restrictions and is therefore bound by them.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court will likely grant the teacher's request for a mandatory injunction and order the librarian to remove the fence because it violates the recorded restrictions in the general development plan."
