        "question": "In an SR latch built from NOR gates, which condition is not allowed",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which condition isn't allowed in an SR latch made with NOR gates. Let me start by recalling what an SR latch is. It's a type of flip-flop circuit that can be in one of two states, right? It has two inputs, S (Set) and R (Reset), and two outputs, Q and Q'. The basic idea is that applying certain inputs will set or reset the output.\n\nSince it's built using NOR gates, I should probably visualize the circuit. An SR latch with NOR gates usually has two cross-coupled NOR gates. Each gate takes one input (S or R) and the output from the other gate. Let me sketch this mentally: the first NOR gate has inputs S and the output of the second NOR gate, and its output is Q. The second NOR gate has inputs R and the output of the first NOR gate, and its output is Q'. \n\nNow, the inputs S and R are normally active high because NOR gates require a high input to affect the output. Wait, no, actually NOR gates output a 0 if any input is 1. So if either S or R is 1, that would force the respective NOR gate's output to 0. Let me think through the possible input combinations.\n\nWhen both S and R are 0, the outputs depend on the previous state. That's the hold condition, where the latch maintains its current state. If S is 1 and R is 0, then the first NOR gate (with S=1) will output 0, which feeds into the second NOR gate along with R=0. The second NOR gate then has both inputs 0 (since R=0 and the first NOR output is 0), so its output Q' becomes 1. That 1 feeds back to the first NOR gate, which now has inputs S=0 (wait, no, S was 1). Wait, maybe I need to step through this more carefully.\n\nLet me define the NOR gate truth table: if any input is 1, output is 0; otherwise, output is 1. So, for the SR latch:\n\nCase 1: S=0, R=0. The outputs depend on the previous state. Each NOR gate has one input from the other's output. If previously Q was 1 and Q' was 0, then the first NOR gate (S=0 and Q'=0) outputs 1, which keeps Q=1. The second NOR gate (R=0 and Q=1) outputs 0, which is Q'. So it holds. Similarly, if Q was 0 and Q' was 1, it holds. So this is the hold state.\n\nCase 2: S=1, R=0. The first NOR gate (S=1, Q') will output 0 regardless of Q', because S is 1. So Q becomes 0. Then the second NOR gate has inputs R=0 and Q=0 (since Q is now 0), so it outputs 1. Q' becomes 1. This 1 feeds back to the first NOR gate. Now, even if S goes back to 0, the first NOR gate has inputs S=0 and Q'=1, so output remains 0. So Q stays 0, Q' stays 1. This is the set state, where Q is set to 1? Wait, no. Wait, Q is 0 here? Wait, maybe I messed up.\n\nWait, when S=1, the first NOR gate (S and Q') outputs 0. So Q is 0. Then the second NOR gate has R=0 and Q=0, so outputs 1 (Q'). So Q' is 1. Then Q' feeds back to the first NOR gate. So even if S is now 1, but Q' is 1, the first NOR gate still outputs 0. Wait, but S is 1 and Q' is 1, so both inputs are 1? Wait, no, S is 1 and Q' is 1. Wait, no, S is 1, so regardless of Q', the first NOR gate outputs 0. So Q is 0, Q' is 1. But that's supposed to be the set state where Q is 1. Hmm, maybe I have the outputs reversed.\n\nWait, maybe I labeled Q and Q' incorrectly. Let me check again. Let's say the first NOR gate has output Q, and the second has output Q'. So when S=1, the first NOR gate (S=1, other input Q') outputs 0. So Q=0. Then the second NOR gate has inputs R=0 and Q=0, so outputs 1. So Q'=1. Then Q' feeds back to the first NOR gate. So even if S is 1, Q' is 1, so NOR(1,1)=0. So Q remains 0. Wait, but setting S=1 is supposed to set Q to 1. So maybe I have the outputs labeled wrong. Maybe the first NOR gate's output is Q', and the second is Q? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the standard configuration is different. Let me look up the standard SR latch with NOR gates. Wait, I can't look it up, but I need to recall. Typically, the cross-coupled NOR gates have each gate's output feeding back to the other's input. So, if S is connected to one NOR gate along with the feedback from Q', and R is connected to the other NOR gate with feedback from Q. So, when S is asserted (1), it should set Q to 1. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose the first NOR gate has inputs S and Q', output Q. The second NOR gate has inputs R and Q, output Q'. So when S=1, regardless of Q', the first NOR gate outputs 0 (since any 1 input gives 0). So Q=0. Then the second NOR gate has inputs R=0 and Q=0, so outputs 1. So Q'=1. Then Q' feeds back to the first NOR gate. So even if S is now 0, the first NOR gate has inputs S=0 and Q'=1, so outputs 0. So Q remains 0, Q' remains 1. Wait, that's not setting Q to 1. That seems like the opposite. Maybe I have the outputs swapped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first NOR gate's output is Q', and the second is Q. Let me try that. First NOR gate: inputs S and Q, output Q'. Second NOR gate: inputs R and Q', output Q. So when S=1, first NOR gate (S=1 and Q) outputs 0, so Q'=0. Then the second NOR gate has inputs R=0 and Q'=0, so outputs 1. So Q=1. Then Q feeds back to the first NOR gate. Now, even if S returns to 0, the first NOR gate has inputs S=0 and Q=1, so outputs 0. So Q' remains 0, Q remains 1. That makes sense. So S=1 sets Q to 1. Similarly, R=1 would reset Q to 0.\n\nSo in this correct configuration, when S=1 and R=0, Q becomes 1. When R=1 and S=0, Q becomes 0. When both S=0 and R=0, the latch holds its previous state. Now, the forbidden state is when both S and R are 1. Let's see why. If S=1 and R=1, then both NOR gates have at least one input as 1. The first NOR gate (S=1 and Q) outputs 0, so Q'=0. The second NOR gate (R=1 and Q') outputs 0, so Q=0. Then both Q and Q' are 0. But in a normal state, Q and Q' should be complements. If both are 0, that's invalid. Moreover, when the inputs return to 0, both NOR gates will have all inputs 0 (since S and R are 0, and Q and Q' are both 0). So each NOR gate will output 1. But then Q and Q' both become 1, which again is invalid because they should be complements. This creates a race condition, and the final state is unpredictable. Therefore, S=1 and R=1 is not allowed.\n\nSo the forbidden condition is when both S and R are high (1). The question is asking which condition is not allowed, so the answer is S=1 and R=1. But let me confirm again with the NOR gate setup. If both S and R are 1, then both NOR gates have at least one input as 1. The first NOR gate (S=1 and Q) outputs 0, so Q'=0. The second NOR gate (R=1 and Q') outputs 0, so Q=0. So both Q and Q' are 0. Then when S and R return to 0, both NOR gates have inputs 0 and 0 (since Q and Q' were 0), so they both output 1. Now Q and Q' are both 1, which again is invalid. So the circuit becomes unstable. Therefore, S=R=1 is forbidden."
