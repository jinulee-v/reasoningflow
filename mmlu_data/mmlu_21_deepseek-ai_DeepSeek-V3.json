        "question": "What is the difference between a male and a female catheter?",
        "response": "Male and female catheters are designed to accommodate the anatomical differences between the sexes. Here are the key differences:\n\n### 1. **Length:**\n   - **Male Catheter:** Longer, typically around 16 inches (40 cm), to navigate the longer male urethra.\n   - **Female Catheter:** Shorter, usually around 6-8 inches (15-20 cm), as the female urethra is much shorter.\n\n### 2. **Urethral Anatomy:**\n   - **Male Catheter:** Must pass through the longer, curved male urethra, which includes the prostate and penile sections.\n   - **Female Catheter:** Only needs to pass through the shorter, straighter female urethra.\n\n### 3. **Design Considerations:**\n   - Male catheters may have a slightly different tip design to ease insertion through the longer urethra.\n   - Female catheters are simpler in design due to the shorter and straighter urethral path.\n\n### 4. **Usage:**\n   - Both types are used for the same purpose: to drain urine from the bladder. However, the choice of catheter depends on the patient's anatomy.\n\n### 5. **Insertion Technique:**\n   - Insertion of a male catheter requires careful navigation of the longer urethra, often with the penis held at a specific angle.\n   - Female catheter insertion is generally quicker and simpler due to the shorter urethra.\n\n### 6. **Specialized Catheters:**\n   - Some catheters are unisex and can be used for both males and females, but they are often longer to accommodate male anatomy.\n\nIn summary, the primary difference lies in the length and design, tailored to the anatomical differences in the male and female urinary tracts."
