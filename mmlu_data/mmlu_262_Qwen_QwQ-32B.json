        "question": "In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question: \"In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?\" Hmm, I remember that securitization is a concept from security studies, right? Let me think. \n\nFirst, I should recall what securitization means. From what I studied, securitization is a process where an issue is framed as a security threat, which allows for extraordinary measures to address it. The key here is how the threat is presented. \n\nThe question is asking about the specific way a threat must be presented for it to become securitized. I think the main elements involve a speech act by a securitizing actor, usually a political leader or authority, who presents the issue as an existential threat requiring urgent action beyond normal political procedures. \n\nWait, there's a model by Barry Buzan and others in the Copenhagen School. They talk about securitization as a speech act where the speaker frames an issue as a security threat, invoking emergency measures. So the threat has to be presented in a way that it's portrayed as an existential danger, needing immediate response, and justifying the use of exceptional policies or resources. \n\nLet me see if there are specific terms here. The process involves the securitizing move, where the speaker declares the threat, and the audience must accept this framing for it to be successful. So the presentation must be done in a way that convinces the audience that the threat is existential and requires such measures. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is looking for one of the options like \"as an existential threat,\" \"through a speech act,\" \"by a legitimate authority,\" or something similar. Since the question is phrased as \"in which of these ways,\" it might be multiple choice, but since the user hasn't provided options, I need to state the correct method based on the theory. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the threat must be presented as an existential threat that requires emergency measures outside normal political processes, articulated by a securitizing actor through a speech act, and accepted by the relevant audience. The key here is the existential aspect and the framing that justifies extraordinary responses. \n\nI should make sure I'm not mixing up with other concepts. For example, in security studies, securitization is different from just any threat. It's specifically about moving an issue into the security domain, which allows for these exceptional measures. So the presentation has to frame it as an existential threat to the state, society, or other referent objects. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the threat must be presented as an existential danger requiring urgent and exceptional measures, typically through a speech act by a legitimate authority.\n</think>\n\nTo become securitized, a threat must be **presented as an existential danger requiring urgent and exceptional measures**, typically through a **speech act** by a **legitimate authority** (e.g., a political leader or institution). This framing must convince an **audience** that the threat demands immediate action beyond normal political processes, justifying extraordinary policies, resources, or responses. \n\n### Key Elements of Securitization (per the Copenhagen School):\n1. **Existential Threat**: The issue is portrayed as a threat to the survival of a **referent object** (e.g., the state, society, or values).\n2. **Speech Act**: A **securitizing actor** (e.g., a government official) explicitly declares the threat in a way that bypasses\u5e38\u89c4 political debate.\n3. **Urgency and Extraordinary Measures**: The threat is framed as requiring immediate, non-negotiable action outside standard procedures.\n4. **Audience Acceptance**: The audience (e.g., public, institutions) must accept this framing for securitization to succeed.\n\nIn summary, the threat must be **framed existentially** and **articulated through a speech act** that legitimizes emergency responses."
