        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nOtto von Bismarck likely made this speech in reaction to which of the following issues?",
        "response": "Otto von Bismarck likely made this speech in reaction to the issue of social welfare and the need for a social safety net for workers. The speech highlights the insecurity faced by workers, including the lack of job security, health risks, and the prospect of old age and disability. It also mentions the inadequacy of the current help for the poor, particularly in large cities. This suggests that Bismarck was advocating for a more comprehensive system of social welfare to address these issues."
