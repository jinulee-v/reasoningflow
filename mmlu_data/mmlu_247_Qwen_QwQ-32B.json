        "question": "A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?",
        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a 32-year-old woman who's been experiencing some symptoms since her husband died eight months ago. The key points here are her decreased appetite, trouble sleeping, sadness, frequent crying, and these new rituals like checking door locks five times and counting toilet paper exactly five times. She mentions she's always been a perfectionist, but these urges and rituals are new.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what's going on with her. The symptoms of sadness, crying, appetite and sleep issues sound like depression. But then there's the part about the rituals\u2014checking door locks multiple times, counting toilet paper. That makes me think of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The question is asking about pharmacotherapy targeting a neurotransmitter, so I need to link her symptoms to the appropriate neurotransmitter system.\n\nWait, but she had a traumatic event (her husband's death) eight months ago. Could this be PTSD? But the compulsions here are more about rituals and exactness, which is more OCD-like. PTSD usually involves re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance, hyperarousal. Her symptoms don't mention flashbacks or avoidance of reminders, but more about the compulsions. So maybe it's OCD triggered by the stress of the loss?\n\nAlternatively, could it be depression with obsessive-compulsive features? Sometimes depression can have obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors, but the rituals here seem more pronounced and specific. The key is that these rituals (checking, counting) are new and not just part of her usual perfectionism. So maybe the stressor led to the onset of OCD.\n\nNow, for treatment, OCD is typically treated with SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) or clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant that affects serotonin). The neurotransmitter involved here is serotonin. SSRIs increase serotonin availability by preventing its reuptake. So the answer would be serotonin.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions she's been a perfectionist. Perfectionism can be part of OCD or maybe an anxiety disorder. But the new compulsions are the key. Also, the time frame is eight months since the event. If it were PTSD, the symptoms might have started sooner, but OCD can develop after stressors. The rituals are classic OCD symptoms\u2014checking, counting, exactness. So the primary issue here is OCD, even though there's a depressive component.\n\nPharmacotherapy for OCD targets serotonin. So the answer should be serotonin. Let me confirm: OCD is linked to serotonin dysfunction. SSRIs are first-line. So the targeted neurotransmitter is serotonin.\n</think>\n\nThe patient's symptoms include persistent sadness, crying, and changes in appetite and sleep, which suggest depression. However, the hallmark features here are the **new-onset compulsions** (e.g., repeatedly checking door locks, counting toilet paper exactly five times), which are classic signs of **obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)**. These compulsions are distinct from her pre-existing perfectionism and emerged after a significant stressor (her husband's death), though OCD is not solely caused by stress. \n\n**Key points:**  \n- **OCD** is primarily associated with dysregulation of **serotonin** neurotransmission.  \n- First-line pharmacotherapy for OCD includes **SSRIs** (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline) or the tricyclic antidepressant **clomipramine**, which enhance serotonergic activity.  \n- While depression and PTSD can co-occur with OCD, the compulsions here are central to the diagnosis, pointing to serotonin as the target neurotransmitter.  \n\n**Answer:** **Serotonin**.  \n\nThe pharmacotherapy should target **serotonin**, as OCD is most effectively treated with medications that modulate this neurotransmitter."
