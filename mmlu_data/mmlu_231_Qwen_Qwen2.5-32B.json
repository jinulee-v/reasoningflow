        "response": "According to Timothy Pauketat, the evidence for social stratification and political power at Cahokia suggests that the site was a complex society with a hierarchical structure, where certain individuals or groups held more power and resources than others. This is supported by the presence of large public buildings, such as the Monks Mound, which may have served as the residence of the elite, as well as the distribution of goods and resources, which suggests that there was a system of trade and exchange that was controlled by those in power. Additionally, the presence of human sacrifice and other forms of ritual violence may indicate that the elite used their power to maintain social order and control over the population. Overall, the evidence suggests that Cahokia was a complex society with a strong political and social structure, where power and resources were concentrated in the hands of a few."
