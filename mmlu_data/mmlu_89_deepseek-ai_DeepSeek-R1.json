        "question": "As of 2017, how many of the world\u2019s 1-year-old children today have been vaccinated against some disease? *",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many of the world\u2019s 1-year-old children were vaccinated against some disease as of 2017. Let me start by breaking down the question. The user is asking for the number of children who are 1 year old and have been vaccinated against any disease. But I should make sure I understand if they mean coverage for specific vaccines or any vaccine in general.\n\nFirst, I recall that vaccination coverage is often reported by organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) or UNICEF. These reports usually provide percentages of children who have received specific vaccines by a certain age, typically 1 year. Common vaccines include those for diseases like measles, polio, DTP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), hepatitis B, Hib, and others.\n\nThe key here is that the question is about \"some disease,\" which implies any vaccination, not a specific one. However, when reporting vaccination coverage, organizations often refer to the percentage of children who have received the recommended vaccines. The most commonly cited statistic is the DTP3 coverage, which measures the percentage of children who have received three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine by age 1. This is used as an indicator of overall vaccination coverage because it's a common vaccine and serves as a proxy for access to immunization services.\n\nBut the user is asking for the number of children vaccinated, not the percentage. So I need to find the total number of 1-year-old children in the world in 2017 and then apply the coverage rate to estimate the number vaccinated.\n\nFirst, I need the global population of 1-year-olds in 2017. Since children are typically 1 year old in the year after they are born, the number of 1-year-olds in 2017 would be approximately equal to the number of live births in 2016. According to World Bank data, the global number of live births in 2016 was around 140 million. However, I should verify this figure. Alternatively, the UN estimates might be more accurate. The UN's World Population Prospects report for 2017 might have the exact number. Let me recall: in recent years, the annual global births have been around 140 million. So if we take that number, then the number of 1-year-olds in 2017 would be roughly 140 million.\n\nNext, I need the vaccination coverage rate. As per WHO and UNICEF estimates, the global coverage for DTP3 in 2017 was about 85%. If we use that as a proxy for vaccination against some disease, then 85% of 140 million would be 119 million children. However, this is specific to DTP3. But the question is about vaccination against \"some disease,\" which could mean any vaccine. But most children receive multiple vaccines. For example, the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis is given at birth in many countries, and the first dose of measles vaccine is typically given around 9-12 months. So coverage rates vary by vaccine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of children who have received at least one vaccine, regardless of which one. In that case, the coverage would be higher than 85%, perhaps closer to 90% or more. For example, BCG coverage is often higher in countries where TB is prevalent. However, in some high-income countries, BCG isn't routinely given unless there's a risk, so coverage might be lower there.\n\nBut I need to find a reliable source. Let me check WHO's immunization coverage data for 2017. According to WHO's 2018 report, global DTP3 coverage was 85%, as I thought. They also report that about 116.2 million infants were vaccinated with DTP3 in 2017. Wait, that number might be the actual number, calculated from the coverage percentage and the target population. If 85% of 140 million is 119 million, but the report says 116.2 million, perhaps the target population is slightly different. Maybe the denominator is the surviving infants, considering some mortality before reaching 1 year of age. Alternatively, the actual number of children reaching 1 year might be slightly less than the number of live births due to mortality in the first year.\n\nAlternatively, the estimated number of children surviving to 1 year might be around 130 million. Let me check. The global infant mortality rate in 2017 was about 29 deaths per 1,000 live births. So if there were 140 million live births, then approximately 140,000,000 - (140,000,000 * 29/1000) = 140,000,000 - 4,060,000 = 135,940,000 children surviving to age 1. So around 136 million. If DTP3 coverage is 85%, then 0.85 * 136 million \u2248 115.6 million, which aligns with the WHO figure of 116.2 million. Close enough, considering possible rounding.\n\nBut the question is about vaccination against \"some disease,\" not specifically DTP3. So perhaps the number is higher if we consider any vaccine. For example, BCG coverage is higher in many countries. According to WHO data, global BCG coverage was around 90% in 2017. Measles first dose coverage was about 85%. So if we take BCG coverage at 90%, then 0.9 * 136 million \u2248 122.4 million. But BCG is not administered in all countries; for instance, the US doesn't routinely give BCG. So maybe the global coverage is lower. Wait, WHO reports BCG coverage as 90% globally. So perhaps 90% of children receive at least BCG. But some children might receive BCG but not other vaccines. However, the question is about being vaccinated against \"some disease,\" so even one vaccine would count.\n\nTherefore, if BCG coverage is 90%, then the number would be 0.9 * 136 million \u2248 122.4 million. But DTP3 is 85%, which is 115.6 million. However, some children might have received BCG but not DTP3, and vice versa. So the total number of children who received at least one vaccine would be higher than either of these. To estimate this, we need to know the proportion of children who received at least one vaccine. However, this data might not be readily available because coverage is usually reported per vaccine, not an aggregate of any vaccine.\n\nAlternatively, the figure might be close to the DTP3 coverage, as DTP is part of the standard immunization schedule and is often used as the indicator for immunization program performance. However, some children might have received other vaccines but not DTP3. For example, in countries where DTP3 coverage is low, BCG or measles coverage might be higher. But in most cases, children who receive vaccines get multiple ones. \n\nAnother angle: UNICEF and WHO track the number of children who are \"fully vaccinated,\" which usually means they've received all recommended vaccines. However, the question isn't about being fully vaccinated, just having received any vaccine. So the number should be higher than the fully vaccinated number.\n\nGiven that BCG coverage is 90%, measles is 85%, DTP3 is 85%, and others like polio are similar, perhaps the percentage of children who received at least one vaccine is around 90% or higher. Because even in countries with lower coverage, most children receive some vaccines. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, BCG coverage is very high, often over 90%, while DTP3 might be lower. In contrast, in countries where BCG isn't routine, like the US, other vaccines like Hepatitis B are given at birth. So combining all these, maybe the global coverage for at least one vaccine is around 90-95%.\n\nIf we take 90% as a conservative estimate, then 0.9 * 136 million \u2248 122.4 million. If 95%, then 129.2 million. But I need a source. Let me check if WHO or UNICEF has data on the number of children receiving at least one vaccine. \n\nLooking up, I find that WHO's Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) aimed for 90% coverage for all vaccines, but they often report individual vaccine coverage. However, there's a metric called \"the proportion of children who received no vaccines\" or \"zero-dose children.\" According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, in 2017, approximately 19.9 million children under the age of 1 did not receive the DTP1 vaccine, which is the first dose of DTP. Since DTP1 is usually given at 6 weeks, these are children who haven't received even the first dose of DTP. However, some of these children might have received other vaccines like BCG or polio if those are given at birth or earlier. For example, BCG is often given at birth, so a child might have received BCG but not DTP1. Therefore, the number of zero-dose children (those who haven't received any vaccines) would be lower than 19.9 million.\n\nAccording to a 2018 UNICEF report, an estimated 20 million infants worldwide did not receive the DTP3 vaccine in 2017, but this refers to incomplete vaccination. However, the number of children who didn't receive any vaccines (zero-dose) was around 10 million in 2016, according to some sources. Wait, let me check more recent data. A 2020 report from WHO states that in 2019, 14 million infants did not receive any vaccines (zero-dose), but that's 2019. For 2017, perhaps it was around 12-13 million. If the total number of 1-year-olds is about 136 million, and 12 million didn't receive any vaccines, then 136 million - 12 million = 124 million children received at least one vaccine. So approximately 124 million.\n\nBut I need to confirm the exact number for 2017. Let me look up the exact figure. According to a 2018 WHO report on immunization coverage, in 2017, an estimated 19.9 million infants worldwide were not reached with DTP3. Of these, 11.5 million were in low- and middle-income countries. However, this is DTP3, not zero-dose. The zero-dose children are those who didn't receive any vaccines. Another source, Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance), mentions that in 2017, approximately 10 million children in Gavi-supported countries were zero-dose. But that's only in Gavi countries, not globally. \n\nA 2019 study published in \"Vaccine\" journal estimated that in 2017, the number of zero-dose children was 12.9 million. If that's the case, then subtracting from the total 136 million, we get 136 - 12.9 = 123.1 million children who received at least one vaccine. So approximately 123 million.\n\nHowever, this is an estimate. The exact number might vary based on the data source. The user is asking for the number as of 2017, so the most accurate answer would reference WHO or UNICEF data from that year. \n\nPutting it all together, the total number of 1-year-old children in 2017 was approximately 136 million (surviving infants). If around 12.9 million were zero-dose, then 136 - 12.9 = 123.1 million received at least one vaccine. Therefore, the answer would be approximately 123 million children vaccinated against some disease.\n\nBut I should check if the surviving infants number is correct. The global infant mortality rate in 2017 was about 29 per 1,000 live births. If there were 140 million live births, then infant deaths would be 140,000,000 * 29/1000 = 4,060,000. So surviving infants would be 140,000,000 - 4,060,000 = 135,940,000, roughly 136 million. Therefore, subtracting the zero-dose children (12.9 million) gives approximately 123 million vaccinated.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of zero-dose children was higher, say 14 million, then the vaccinated number would be 136 -14 = 122 million. But according to the study I mentioned earlier, it was 12.9 million in 2017. Therefore, 123 million is a reasonable estimate.\n\nHowever, some sources might report different numbers. For example, the WHO's 2018 report states that in 2017, 116.2 million children received DTP3 vaccines. Since DTP3 coverage is 85%, that implies the target population was around 116.2 / 0.85 \u2248 136.7 million, which aligns with the surviving infants estimate. But DTP3 is just one vaccine. The number of children receiving at least one vaccine would be higher. \n\nGiven that the zero-dose children are those who didn't receive any vaccines, subtracting them from the total gives the number who received at least one. If zero-dose is 12.9 million, then 136 -12.9 = 123.1 million. Therefore, the answer is approximately 123 million children."
