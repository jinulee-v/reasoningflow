        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nThe \"quantum jump\" mentioned in the passage most directly contributed to which of the following developments in the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.?",
        "response": "The \"quantum jump\" mentioned in the passage most directly contributed to the development of European colonialism and imperialism in the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. This is because the exploitation of ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump was a key factor in the success of Western European powers in establishing colonies and expanding their influence around the world."
