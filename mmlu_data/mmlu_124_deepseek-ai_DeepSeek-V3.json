        "response": "Supply-side fiscal policy refers to government measures aimed at increasing the productive capacity of the economy, typically by incentivizing production, investment, and innovation. The goal is to stimulate economic growth by improving the supply of goods and services, rather than focusing on boosting demand. \n\nThe following policy best describes supply-side fiscal policy:\n\n**Reducing taxes on businesses and individuals to encourage investment, work, and entrepreneurship.**\n\nThis policy aligns with supply-side principles because it aims to enhance productivity and economic efficiency by lowering the cost of doing business and increasing the incentives for individuals and firms to engage in economic activities. Other examples of supply-side policies include deregulation, reducing barriers to trade, and investing in infrastructure or education to improve long-term productivity."
