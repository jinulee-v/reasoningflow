        "question": "The Singleton design pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?\nI. The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.\nII. The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\nIII. The Singleton class has a private constructor.",
        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this question about the Singleton design pattern. Hmm, I remember that Singleton is all about ensuring there's only one instance of a class. Let me go through each statement one by one.\n\nStatement I says, \"The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.\" From what I recall, the Singleton typically has a static method like getInstance() that returns the single instance. That method checks if the instance exists and creates it if it doesn't. So I think Statement I is true.\n\nStatement II: \"The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.\" Wait, if the Singleton has a private constructor, how would it extend a superclass? Because when you subclass, the subclass constructor needs to call the superclass constructor. If the Singleton's constructor is private, maybe the superclass has a public or protected constructor? Or maybe if the Singleton uses a different approach, like a static inner class or an enum? Hmm, maybe it's possible. For example, if the Singleton's constructor is private, but the superclass has a protected constructor. Then the Singleton could extend it. But wait, the Singleton's constructor would have to call super(), right? If the superclass's constructor is protected and the Singleton is in a different package, that might not work. Or if they're in the same package, maybe. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the answer is that II can be true? Or is there a restriction because of the private constructor?\n\nStatement III: \"The Singleton class has a private constructor.\" Definitely, the constructor is made private to prevent other classes from instantiating it directly. So III is true. That's a key part of the Singleton pattern.\n\nSo summarizing: I and III are true. What about II? Let me think again. If Singleton is a subclass, then the superclass must have a constructor that the Singleton can access. If the Singleton's constructor is private, but the superclass has a public or protected constructor, then maybe. For example:\n\npublic class SuperClass {\n    protected SuperClass() { }\n}\n\npublic class Singleton extends SuperClass {\n    private static Singleton instance;\n\n    private Singleton() {\n        super(); // This would call the protected constructor of SuperClass\n    }\n\n    public static Singleton getInstance() { ... }\n}\n\nIn this case, Singleton has a private constructor and extends SuperClass. So II could be true. Therefore, II is possible. So all three statements I, II, III are true? Wait, but wait. Wait, the Singleton's constructor is private. So when you extend a class, the subclass constructor implicitly calls the superclass constructor. If the superclass has a no-arg constructor that's accessible (public or protected), then yes. But if the superclass's constructor is private, then no. But the statement II says \"can be a subclass of another class\", not \"must be\". So it's possible in some cases. Therefore, II is true. So all three are correct?\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check. The Singleton pattern's standard implementation uses a private constructor. So III is true. The static factory method (getInstance) is standard, so I is true. For II, can Singleton be a subclass? Well, in Java, if a class has a private constructor, it can still extend another class as long as the superclass has an accessible constructor. So yes, Singleton can be a subclass. Therefore, II is also true. So all three statements are correct?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a catch. For example, if Singleton is implemented using an enum, then it can't extend another class because enums can't extend classes. But the question doesn't specify the implementation method. The traditional Singleton uses a class with a private constructor and a static method. So in that case, II can be true. So the answer would be I, II, III are all true. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: If a Singleton class is designed to have a private constructor, then it can't be subclassed itself, right? Because any subclass would need to call super() in their constructor, but the super constructor is private. But the question is about Singleton being a subclass of another class, not being a superclass. So if Singleton is extending another class, that's possible as long as the parent class's constructor is accessible. So II is true. Therefore, all three statements are correct. So the answer is I, II, III are all true."
