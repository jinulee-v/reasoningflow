        "question": " In which dynasty was the \"Mandate of Heaven\" developed to legitimatize the new rulers?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out in which dynasty the \"Mandate of Heaven\" was developed to legitimize new rulers. Hmm, I remember that the Mandate of Heaven is a Chinese concept, right? It's something about the ruler's divine right to rule. But which dynasty first used it?\n\nLet me think. The Zhou Dynasty comes to mind because I think they overthrew the Shang Dynasty. Maybe they used the Mandate of Heaven to justify their takeover. The Shang was before the Zhou, so if the Zhou needed to legitimize their rule after defeating the Shang, they might have created this idea that the heavens supported them. \n\nWait, but was it actually developed during the Zhou? I think the concept might have started earlier, but maybe formalized during the Zhou. The Mandate of Heaven was a way to say that the previous dynasty lost the mandate because of their immoral rule, so the new dynasty was chosen by heaven. That makes sense as a way to justify a change in power. \n\nI should check if there's any earlier dynasty that used it. The Xia Dynasty was before the Shang, but I don't recall them using the Mandate. The Shang might have had some religious or divine justification, but maybe not the Mandate of Heaven specifically. The term \"Mandate of Heaven\" (Tianming in Chinese) is often associated with the Zhou. \n\nAlso, there's the idea that the Duke of Zhou, a key figure in the Zhou Dynasty, promoted this concept to reinforce their authority. So putting it all together, the Zhou Dynasty is the most likely answer. But I should make sure I'm not confusing it with later dynasties. The Han Dynasty came after the Zhou, but they might have adopted and expanded the concept. However, the question is about when it was developed, so the origin would be Zhou. \n\nAnother point: the Mandate of Heaven was a recurring theme in Chinese history, used by subsequent dynasties to justify their rule, but the initial development was during the Zhou when they replaced the Shang. Yeah, I think that's right. So the answer should be the Zhou Dynasty.\n</think>\n\nThe concept of the **Mandate of Heaven** (*Tianming*) was formally developed and systematized during the **Zhou Dynasty** (c. 1046\u2013256 BCE), particularly after the Zhou overthrew the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600\u20131046 BCE). \n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Origins in the Zhou Conquest**: The Zhou rulers justified their overthrow of the Shang by claiming that the Shang had lost the Mandate of Heaven due to their rulers' immoral behavior and failure to govern wisely. This provided a moral and divine basis for their own rule.\n   \n2. **Philosophical Development**: The Duke of Zhou, a pivotal figure in consolidating Zhou power, emphasized the Mandate as a conditional grant from heaven. Rulers were required to govern justly (with the *Mandate of Heaven* dependent on their *virtue* or *de*). If they failed, natural disasters, peasant uprisings, or military defeats signaled the loss of the Mandate, allowing another dynasty to take over.\n\n3. **Legacy**: While earlier dynasties like the Shang had religious justifications for rule, the Zhou formalized the Mandate into a political philosophy that influenced Chinese dynasties for millennia, including the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing. It became a tool for both legitimizing new rulers and criticizing corrupt ones.\n\nThus, the **Zhou Dynasty** is credited with developing the Mandate of Heaven as a foundational principle of Chinese political legitimacy."
