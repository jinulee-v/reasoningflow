        "question": "Baron admits that the versions of the ticking bomb hypothetical she discusses are \"stunningly stupid,\" but she claims this is actually evidence of",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what Baron is claiming when she says that the versions of the ticking bomb hypothetical she discusses are \"stunningly stupid,\" but that this is actually evidence of something. Let me start by recalling what the ticking bomb scenario typically involves. It's a thought experiment used in ethics, especially in discussions about torture. The basic idea is that there's a bomb set to explode, killing many people, and you have a suspect who knows how to stop it. The question is whether it's morally permissible to torture the suspect to get the information.\n\nNow, Baron is talking about versions of this hypothetical that are \"stunningly stupid.\" The term \"stunningly stupid\" suggests that these versions are overly simplistic, unrealistic, or perhaps even absurd. Maybe they ignore important details or present the scenario in a way that's too black-and-white, making the ethical dilemma seem easier than it actually is in real life. \n\nBut Baron says that this stupidity is actually evidence of something. The key here is to figure out what point she's making by pointing out the flaws in these hypotheticals. In ethical discussions, sometimes people use extreme scenarios to test moral principles. For example, utilitarians might argue that in such a dire situation, the greatest good for the greatest number justifies torture, while deontologists might argue that torture is always wrong, regardless of the consequences.\n\nIf Baron is criticizing the \"stunningly stupid\" versions, perhaps she's arguing that these simplified scenarios fail to capture the complexity of real-world ethical dilemmas. Maybe she's suggesting that because these hypotheticals are so unrealistic, they don't provide a solid basis for making real-world moral decisions. Alternatively, she might be pointing out that the very fact that people use such simplistic scenarios to argue for or against a position shows a flaw in their reasoning\u2014perhaps that they're not considering the nuances, or that they're trying to force a complex issue into an overly simplistic framework.\n\nAnother angle could be that the \"stunningly stupid\" nature of the hypotheticals actually highlights a problem with the underlying ethical theories being tested. For instance, if a theory can only be defended in such unrealistic scenarios, maybe it's not a robust theory. Or conversely, if the scenarios are so extreme that they don't reflect real possibilities, then the conclusions drawn from them might not be valid.\n\nWait, the question says Baron claims that the \"stunningly stupid\" versions are actually evidence of something. So maybe she's using the absurdity of the scenarios to argue that the ethical principles being discussed (like the permissibility of torture) are being tested in a way that's not reflective of real situations, thereby undermining the arguments that use these scenarios. For example, if someone argues that torture is permissible in the ticking bomb case, Baron might counter that since the scenario is so unrealistic, it doesn't provide a good argument for allowing torture in real life, where situations are more ambiguous and the consequences less certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she's making a point about how people use these extreme cases to justify certain actions, but the very extremity of the cases shows that they're not applicable to real-world policy or ethics. The \"stunningly stupid\" part could be evidence that the arguments relying on such scenarios are flawed because they don't account for practical realities.\n\nI should also consider if there's a specific philosopher or argument Baron is referencing here. The ticking bomb scenario is famously used by people like Alan Dershowitz, who controversially argued that legalizing torture in extreme cases might be necessary. On the other hand, critics like Michael Sandel or others might argue against it on moral grounds. If Baron is a philosopher discussing this, maybe she's part of the latter group.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes in philosophy, thought experiments are criticized for being too contrived. The fact that the scenarios are \"stunningly stupid\" might be Baron's way of saying that they're so contrived that they don't actually test the moral principles they're supposed to. Therefore, the evidence here is that the scenarios' absurdity undermines their utility in ethical debate. So, the stupidity of the versions is evidence that such hypotheticals are not good tools for determining real-world ethics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Baron is arguing that the very need to create such extreme scenarios to justify an action (like torture) shows that the action is inherently wrong. Because if you have to imagine a scenario so outlandish to make it seem permissible, then in normal circumstances, it's clearly impermissible. The \"stunningly stupid\" nature of the hypotheticals thus serves as evidence that the action in question (torture) is morally indefensible except in the most extreme, unrealistic cases.\n\nWait, that might be a better angle. If someone has to resort to a scenario that's so unrealistic to argue for a position, that could indicate that the position isn't justifiable under normal or even moderately realistic conditions. Therefore, the fact that the scenarios are \"stunningly stupid\" is evidence that the argument for the position (e.g., permissible torture) is weak, because it can't be justified in more plausible scenarios.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Baron is pointing out that the simplicity of the scenarios ignores the complexity of real moral decisions, such as the uncertainty of whether the suspect actually has the information, the potential for false confessions, the long-term consequences of legalizing torture, etc. The \"stupidity\" here is that the hypotheticals don't account for these factors, so using them as evidence for a moral stance is flawed.\n\nPutting this together, Baron is likely arguing that the extreme and unrealistic nature of the ticking bomb scenarios (their \"stunningly stupid\" aspects) actually serves as evidence against the validity of using such scenarios to argue for the permissibility of actions like torture. The very fact that the scenarios have to be so contrived shows that in more realistic situations, the moral choice isn't so clear-cut, and thus the argument based on these scenarios is not sound. Therefore, the stupidity of the hypotheticals is evidence that the ethical conclusions drawn from them are not reliable or applicable to real-world ethics.\n</think>\n\nBaron's assertion that the \"stunningly stupid\" versions of the ticking bomb hypothetical are actually evidence of something hinges on a critique of how such thought experiments are used in ethical debates. Here's a structured breakdown of her likely argument:\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Critique of Simplification**:  \n   The \"stunningly stupid\" label highlights the **overly simplistic and unrealistic nature** of these scenarios. They often ignore complexities like uncertainty (e.g., whether the suspect truly has the information, the reliability of confessions), unintended consequences (e.g., eroding legal norms, false leads), and moral trade-offs beyond immediate lives saved. By stripping away these nuances, the hypotheticals become contrived and unrepresentative of real-world dilemmas.\n\n2. **Evidence Against Moral Permissibility**:  \n   Baron likely argues that the **need to construct such extreme, implausible scenarios** to justify actions like torture (e.g., waterboarding a suspect to stop a bomb) itself undermines the moral case for those actions. If an ethical position (e.g., \"torture is permissible in emergencies\") can only be defended in scenarios that are absurdly idealized, it suggests that the position lacks validity in more realistic contexts. The \"stupidity\" of the hypotheticals thus serves as **evidence that the action in question (e.g., torture) is morally indefensible under normal or even moderately plausible circumstances**.\n\n3. **Flawed Ethical Reasoning**:  \n   The scenarios may reveal a deeper issue with how ethical principles are tested. By forcing a binary choice (torture or mass death), they pressure people to prioritize outcomes over moral consistency. Baron might argue this reflects a **failure to engage with the complexity of ethics**, where principles like human rights or legal integrity cannot be easily overridden by hypothetical \"perfect storms.\" The absurdity of the scenarios thus exposes the **limitations of consequentialist reasoning** when divorced from real-world constraints.\n\n4. **Policy Implications**:  \n   Baron could be emphasizing that **real-world policy cannot be based on such unrealistic extremes**. Even if one accepts the hypothetical\u2019s logic, it does not justify legalizing torture, as doing so would open the door to abuse in ambiguous, non-ideal situations. The \"stupidity\" of the scenarios underscores the **practical dangers of extrapolating from extreme cases** to real governance.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBaron\u2019s claim is that the **very absurdity of the ticking bomb hypotheticals** is evidence that arguments relying on them are **morally and practically unsound**. The scenarios\u2019 unrealistic simplicity undermines their utility in ethical discourse, suggesting that actions like torture cannot be justified even in extreme cases\u2014and certainly not in the messy reality of human decision-making. Thus, the \"stunningly stupid\" nature of the hypotheticals themselves becomes a critique of the ethical positions they are meant to support."
