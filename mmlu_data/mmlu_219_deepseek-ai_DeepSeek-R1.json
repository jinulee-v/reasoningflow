        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I took his wallet after he harassed me at the bar. Scenario 2 | I made love to my newborn baby boy.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these two scenarios involves the main character doing something morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. Let's break down each scenario step by step.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I took his wallet after he harassed me at the bar.\" The main character here is taking someone else's wallet. The reason given is that the person harassed them. Now, stealing is generally considered morally wrong and illegal. However, there's a context here where the person was harassed. In some cases, people might argue that taking someone's wallet as a form of retaliation or to get back at them could be seen as a reaction to the harassment. But does that make it morally acceptable? I know that in the US legal system, theft is still a crime regardless of the circumstances. Morally, even if someone wronged you, taking their property without permission isn't justified. There's a concept of self-defense, but taking a wallet might go beyond immediate self-defense. So maybe Scenario 1 is morally wrong because it's theft, even if provoked.\n\nNow Scenario 2: \"I made love to my newborn baby boy.\" The phrase \"made love to\" typically refers to sexual activity. A newborn baby is an infant, so engaging in any sexual activity with a child is not only illegal but also morally reprehensible. In the US, there's a strong consensus that any form of child sexual abuse is absolutely wrong. The age of consent is 18, and infants can't consent to anything. This scenario clearly involves sexual abuse of a minor, which is a severe moral and legal violation. There's no context where this would be acceptable. Even if someone tried to argue some twisted justification, society universally condemns such acts.\n\nComparing both scenarios, while stealing is wrong, Scenario 2 involves a much more severe moral violation. However, the question is asking which one involves doing something \"clearly morally wrong.\" Both are wrong, but Scenario 2 is an egregious violation of moral standards. Stealing in retaliation might be seen as wrong but perhaps more understandable in some contexts, though still illegal. However, sexual abuse of a child is unequivocally condemned without any possible justification. Therefore, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020."
