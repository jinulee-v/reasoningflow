        "response": "The **Natural Law** School of jurisprudence postulates that the law is based on what is \"correct\" or morally right. This school of thought asserts that there are inherent moral principles that govern human behavior and that laws should reflect these universal moral standards. Natural law theorists believe that unjust laws (those that conflict with moral principles) are not truly laws and do not carry the same binding authority as just laws. This perspective contrasts with legal positivism, which holds that the validity of law is not dependent on its moral content but rather on its source or process of enactment."
