        "question": "Which of the following sets has the smallest standard deviation? Which has the largest?\nI: {1,2,3}\nII: {-10,10}\nIII: {100}\n",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these three sets has the smallest standard deviation and which has the largest. The sets are:\n\nI: {1, 2, 3}\n\nII: {-10, 10}\n\nIII: {100}\n\nHmm, standard deviation measures how spread out the numbers in a data set are. A low standard deviation means the numbers are close to the mean, and a high one means they're more spread out. Let me recall the formula for standard deviation. It's the square root of the variance, right? And variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n\nAlright, let me start with set I: {1, 2, 3}. First, I need to find the mean. The mean is (1 + 2 + 3)/3 = 6/3 = 2. Then, the deviations from the mean are (1-2) = -1, (2-2)=0, and (3-2)=1. Squaring those gives 1, 0, and 1. The average of those squared deviations is (1 + 0 + 1)/3 = 2/3. So the variance is 2/3, and the standard deviation is the square root of 2/3. Let me compute that. The square root of 2 is about 1.414, so sqrt(2/3) is approximately 0.816. \n\nNow set II: {-10, 10}. The mean here is (-10 + 10)/2 = 0/2 = 0. The deviations from the mean are -10 - 0 = -10 and 10 - 0 = 10. Squaring those gives 100 and 100. The average of those squared deviations is (100 + 100)/2 = 200/2 = 100. So the variance is 100, and the standard deviation is the square root of 100, which is 10. That's a much larger standard deviation than set I.\n\nSet III: {100}. Hmm, this is a single number. The standard deviation of a single number should be zero because there's no variation. Let me confirm that. The mean is just 100. The deviation from the mean is 100 - 100 = 0. Since there's only one data point, the variance is the average of the squared deviations, but since there's only one term, it's (0)^2 / 1 = 0. So the standard deviation is sqrt(0) = 0. That makes sense.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSet I has a standard deviation of approximately 0.816,\n\nSet II has 10,\n\nSet III has 0.\n\nTherefore, the smallest standard deviation is set III, and the largest is set II.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations for set I. The squared differences were 1, 0, 1. Sum is 2, divided by 3 gives 2/3. Square root of 2/3 is indeed about 0.816. Yeah, that's right.\n\nAnd set II: the deviations are -10 and +10, squared to 100 each. Average is 100, so standard deviation is 10. Correct.\n\nSet III is definitely 0. So yeah, the order from smallest to largest standard deviation is III < I < II. Therefore, the smallest is III and the largest is II.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes here. Let me just think if there's another way to approach it without calculating. For instance, standard deviation is affected by the spread of the data. Set III has no spread at all, so that's the smallest. Set II has the numbers farthest apart (-10 and 10), so that's the largest spread, hence largest standard deviation. Set I is in the middle. So that also makes sense. So yeah, that confirms it again.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe set with the smallest standard deviation is \\boxed{III} and the set with the largest standard deviation is \\boxed{II}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which set has the smallest and largest standard deviation, we calculate the standard deviation for each set:\n\n**Set I: {1, 2, 3}**\n1. Mean: \\(\\frac{1 + 2 + 3}{3} = 2\\)\n2. Deviations from the mean: \\(1 - 2 = -1\\), \\(2 - 2 = 0\\), \\(3 - 2 = 1\\)\n3. Squared deviations: \\((-1)^2 = 1\\), \\(0^2 = 0\\), \\(1^2 = 1\\)\n4. Variance: \\(\\frac{1 + 0 + 1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\)\n5. Standard deviation: \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} \\approx 0.816\\)\n\n**Set II: {-10, 10}**\n1. Mean: \\(\\frac{-10 + 10}{2} = 0\\)\n2. Deviations from the mean: \\(-10 - 0 = -10\\), \\(10 - 0 = 10\\)\n3. Squared deviations: \\((-10)^2 = 100\\), \\(10^2 = 100\\)\n4. Variance: \\(\\frac{100 + 100}{2} = 100\\)\n5. Standard deviation: \\(\\sqrt{100} = 10\\)\n\n**Set III: {100}**\n1. Mean: \\(100\\)\n2. Deviation from the mean: \\(100 - 100 = 0\\)\n3. Squared deviation: \\(0^2 = 0\\)\n4. Variance: \\(\\frac{0}{1} = 0\\)\n5. Standard deviation: \\(\\sqrt{0} = 0\\)\n\nSummarizing the results:\n- Set I has a standard deviation of approximately \\(0.816\\)\n- Set II has a standard deviation of \\(10\\)\n- Set III has a standard deviation of \\(0\\)\n\nThus, the set with the smallest standard deviation is \\(\\boxed{III}\\) and the set with the largest standard deviation is \\(\\boxed{II}\\)."
