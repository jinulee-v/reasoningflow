        "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative preparation should include treatment with which of the following?",
        "response": "The patient presents with a left adrenal mass, elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine levels, and hypertension, which strongly suggests a **pheochromocytoma**. Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors that can cause episodic or sustained hypertension, tachycardia, and other adrenergic symptoms. \n\n**Preoperative preparation for adrenalectomy in a patient with pheochromocytoma is critical to prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises and cardiovascular complications.** The standard approach includes:\n\n1. **Alpha-adrenergic blockade**:  \n   - **Phenoxybenzamine** (a nonselective, irreversible alpha-blocker) is typically initiated 7\u201314 days before surgery to control blood pressure and prevent catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction.  \n   - Once alpha-blockade is established, **beta-blockers** (e.g., propranolol or metoprolol) may be added if tachycardia persists. Beta-blockers should **never** be started before alpha-blockade, as unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation can worsen hypertension.  \n\n2. **Volume expansion**:  \n   - Alpha-blockade often leads to vasodilation and relative hypovolemia. Patients should be encouraged to increase salt and fluid intake to restore intravascular volume.  \n\n3. **Monitoring and optimization**:  \n   - Blood pressure and heart rate should be closely monitored during the preoperative period to ensure adequate blockade and volume status.  \n\n**Answer:** The initial preoperative preparation should include treatment with **an alpha-adrenergic blocker (e.g., phenoxybenzamine)**."
