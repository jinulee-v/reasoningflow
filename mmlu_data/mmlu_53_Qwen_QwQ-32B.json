        "question": "A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the angular magnification of this refracting telescope. Let me recall what I know about telescopes. A refracting telescope uses two converging lenses, right? The first one is the objective lens, which has a longer focal length, and the second one is the eyepiece, which has a shorter focal length. The angular magnification is calculated by the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece. But wait, let me make sure I remember that correctly.\n\nThe problem states that the two lenses are separated by 100 cm. Hmm, so the distance between the two lenses should be the sum of their focal lengths when the telescope is adjusted for infinity. That is, for a telescope in normal adjustment, the distance between the objective and the eyepiece is equal to the sum of their focal lengths. So, if the separation is 100 cm, then f_objective + f_eyepiece = 100 cm. Since the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm, then the objective must have a focal length of 100 cm - 20 cm = 80 cm. \n\nTherefore, the focal length of the objective is 80 cm. Then, the angular magnification M is given by M = -f_objective / f_eyepiece. Wait, the negative sign might indicate the orientation of the image, but since we're talking about angular magnification in telescopes, maybe we just consider the absolute value? Let me check that. \n\nYes, angular magnification is typically given as a positive value when talking about telescopes, so maybe we can ignore the sign here. So plugging in the numbers, M = 80 cm / 20 cm = 4. So the angular magnification should be 4 times. \n\nBut let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything. The formula for angular magnification of a refracting telescope is indeed M = -f_objective / f_eyepiece. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted, but since astronomical telescopes are often used for viewing distant objects where the orientation doesn't matter much, sometimes the magnification is given as a positive value. However, depending on the convention, maybe the question expects the answer with the negative sign? Hmm, the problem just asks for the angular magnification, so maybe they just want the magnitude. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the focal length of the objective. Let me confirm that. The separation between the lenses in a telescope when focused on infinity is indeed the sum of the focal lengths. So if the separation is 100 cm, and the eyepiece is 20 cm, then the objective must be 80 cm. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, if the separation was different, but the problem says they are separated by 100 cm. So that part is correct. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the telescope is in normal adjustment, meaning that the image formed by the objective is at the focal point of the eyepiece. Therefore, the distance between the two lenses is f_objective + f_eyepiece. So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the focal length of the objective is 80 cm. Then, angular magnification is M = -f_obj / f_eye = -80/20 = -4. Since the question asks for angular magnification, which is a magnitude, maybe they just want 4. But sometimes in physics, the magnification can be given with the sign to indicate inversion. Let me check the problem statement again. It just says \"angular magnification\", so maybe they want the absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from an exam where they expect the formula M = f_obj / f_eye, so 80/20 = 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider units? The focal lengths are both in centimeters, so the ratio is unitless, so 4. \n\nAlternatively, is there another way this could be approached? Let me think. Angular magnification is the ratio of the angle subtended by the image at the eye to the angle subtended by the object at the unaided eye. In a telescope, the objective forms an image at infinity (for distant objects), and the eyepiece then allows the eye to view that image. The angular magnification is indeed given by the ratio of the focal lengths. \n\nAlternatively, if the separation was different, but the problem states they are separated by 100 cm. So that must be the sum of the focal lengths. \n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. The angular magnification is 4. \n\nWait, but let me check an example. Suppose the eyepiece is 20 cm, and the separation is 100 cm, so the objective is 80 cm. Then, M = 80/20 = 4. That seems standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different? Wait, sometimes magnification is given as M = (f_obj / f_eye) but with a negative sign. But since the problem doesn't specify direction, maybe just 4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question? Let me see. Wait, the problem says \"angular magnification\". The formula for angular magnification of a telescope is indeed M = -f_obj / f_eye. So if they want the signed value, it's -4, but if they just want the magnitude, it's 4. Since the problem is from an exam, maybe they expect the magnitude. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the separation is not the sum? Wait, in some cases, if the telescope is not in normal adjustment, but the problem doesn't specify that. Since it's a standard telescope, I think we can assume it's in normal adjustment. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 4. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Suppose the focal length of the eyepiece is 20 cm, and the separation is 100 cm. Then the focal length of the objective is 100 - 20 = 80 cm. So M = 80 / 20 = 4. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to convert cm to meters? But since both are in cm, the ratio is the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to linear magnification? But no, telescopes are about angular magnification. \n\nHmm, I think I've verified all the steps. So I think the answer is 4. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular magnification of the telescope is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the angular magnification of the refracting telescope, we start by noting that the distance between the two lenses (objective and eyepiece) when the telescope is in normal adjustment is the sum of their focal lengths. Given that the separation is 100 cm and the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm, we can calculate the focal length of the objective lens as follows:\n\n\\[\nf_{\\text{objective}} + f_{\\text{eyepiece}} = 100 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known value of the eyepiece's focal length:\n\n\\[\nf_{\\text{objective}} + 20 \\, \\text{cm} = 100 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( f_{\\text{objective}} \\):\n\n\\[\nf_{\\text{objective}} = 100 \\, \\text{cm} - 20 \\, \\text{cm} = 80 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nThe angular magnification \\( M \\) of a telescope is given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece:\n\n\\[\nM = -\\frac{f_{\\text{objective}}}{f_{\\text{eyepiece}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\n\\[\nM = -\\frac{80 \\, \\text{cm}}{20 \\, \\text{cm}} = -4\n\\]\n\nSince the problem asks for the angular magnification and typically the magnitude is considered, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"

            "text": "**Final Answer**\nThe angular magnification of the telescope is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the angular magnification of the refracting telescope, we start by noting that the distance between the two lenses (objective and eyepiece) when the telescope is in normal adjustment is the sum of their focal lengths. Given that the separation is 100 cm and the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm, we can calculate the focal length of the objective lens as follows:\n\n\\[\nf_{\\text{objective}} + f_{\\text{eyepiece}} = 100 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known value of the eyepiece's focal length:\n\n\\[\nf_{\\text{objective}} + 20 \\, \\text{cm} = 100 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( f_{\\text{objective}} \\):\n\n\\[\nf_{\\text{objective}} = 100 \\, \\text{cm} - 20 \\, \\text{cm} = 80 \\, \\text{cm}\n\\]\n\nThe angular magnification \\( M \\) of a telescope is given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece:\n\n\\[\nM = -\\frac{f_{\\text{objective}}}{f_{\\text{eyepiece}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\n\\[\nM = -\\frac{80 \\, \\text{cm}}{20 \\, \\text{cm}} = -4\n\\]\n\nSince the problem asks for the angular magnification and typically the magnitude is considered, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
