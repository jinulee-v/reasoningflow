        "question": "How many axles does a standard automobile have?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many axles a standard automobile has. Let me start by recalling what an axle is. From what I remember, an axle is a central shaft for a rotating wheel or gear. In vehicles, axles are crucial because they bear the weight of the vehicle and help in the rotation of the wheels.\n\nNow, thinking about cars I see every day, like sedans or hatchbacks. Most of them have four wheels\u2014two in the front and two in the back. Each wheel is attached to an axle, right? But wait, is each wheel on its own axle, or are they paired? I think in many cars, the front wheels are connected by one axle and the rear wheels by another. So that would be two axles total. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, but some vehicles, like trucks or large SUVs, might have more axles. For example, big trucks have dual rear wheels or even multiple axles for carrying heavier loads. But the question is about a standard automobile, which I assume is a regular passenger car, not a commercial vehicle.\n\nLet me visualize a typical car. Front wheels are connected to the engine via the drivetrain. In front-wheel-drive cars, the front wheels are powered, so they must be connected to an axle. The rear wheels just spin freely, but they still need an axle to hold them in place. So each pair of wheels (front and back) has an axle. That would make two axles.\n\nBut I've heard terms like \"live axle\" and \"dead axle.\" Maybe in some cars, especially older models or certain types, the rear axle might be a solid axle connecting both wheels, while in others, especially modern cars with independent suspension, each wheel might have its own axle. However, even with independent suspension, I think the term \"axle\" still refers to the pair. So even if each wheel has its own axle shaft, collectively, they're considered part of a single axle assembly.\n\nSo, in standard terms, a car with four wheels has two axles: front and rear. Each axle serves two wheels. Therefore, the answer should be two axles. But I want to confirm this. Let me think of other vehicles. A motorcycle has two wheels but only one axle. A bicycle similarly has two wheels and one axle. A tricycle has three wheels and two axles. So, for four-wheeled vehicles, it's two axles. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but sometimes people refer to the number of axles as the number of pairs of wheels. For example, an 18-wheeler truck has five axles (hence 18 wheels). But cars are simpler. So yes, standard cars have two axles. Each axle holds two wheels. Therefore, the answer is two axles."
