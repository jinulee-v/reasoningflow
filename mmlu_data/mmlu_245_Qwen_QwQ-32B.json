        "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative preparation should include treatment with which of the following?",
        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a 42-year-old man scheduled for adrenalectomy in two weeks. He had a motor vehicle collision a month ago, which led to a CT scan showing a 10cm left adrenal mass. His blood pressure was elevated then (160/100), and now it's even higher (170/95). The lab results showed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine, along with high plasma aldosterone. He's otherwise healthy, no meds, and wasn't diagnosed with hypertension before.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what kind of adrenal tumor he has. The adrenal mass could be a pheochromocytoma or an aldosterone-producing adenoma (Conn's syndrome). The key here is the lab results: elevated metanephrines (normetanephrine and metanephrine) point towards pheochromocytoma, since those are metabolites of catecholamines. Aldosterone is also high, which might suggest primary hyperaldosteronism. But sometimes pheochromocytomas can co-secrete aldosterone, though that's less common. Alternatively, maybe he has two separate issues? But given the context, the surgeon is recommending adrenalectomy, which is the treatment for both, but the pre-op management would differ.\n\nWait, the question is about preoperative preparation. For pheochromocytoma, you need to control hypertension before surgery to prevent hypertensive crises during surgery. The standard approach is to start alpha-blockers first (like phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin) to block alpha receptors, which reduces the peripheral effects of catecholamines. Then, after adequate alpha blockade, beta-blockers can be added to control heart rate. If you give beta-blockers without alpha-blockade first, you might get unopposed alpha stimulation leading to severe hypertension.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's Conn's syndrome (aldosterone-producing), the main issue is hypokalemia and hypertension. But in this case, the labs mentioned that electrolytes were normal. So maybe the aldosterone is high but not causing electrolyte issues yet. For Conn's, pre-op management might involve spironolactone or eplerenone to block aldosterone, but since he's going to have surgery, maybe they just proceed without meds? But the key here is the elevated metanephrines, which are more indicative of pheochromocytoma. So the main issue is the pheo.\n\nTherefore, the preoperative preparation should focus on managing the catecholamine excess. So starting alpha-blockers. The options probably include alpha-blockers like phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin. Alternatively, maybe a calcium channel blocker if there's another consideration, but I think the standard is alpha-blockade first.\n\nWait, the question says \"initial\" preoperative preparation. So the first step is alpha-blockade. Let me confirm. Yes, for pheochromocytoma, you start with an alpha-adrenergic blocker (like phenoxybenzamine, which is non-selective, or doxazosin, which is selective alpha-1). The goal is to control blood pressure and prevent catecholamine-induced hypertensive crises during surgery. Since the surgery is in two weeks, there's enough time to titrate the dose. \n\nThe elevated aldosterone might be a red herring here, but since the metanephrines are elevated, the primary issue is pheochromocytoma. So the answer should be an alpha-blocker. Let me check if there's any other consideration. If the aldosterone is high, maybe they also need to address that, but the priority is the pheochromocytoma because of the surgical risks. Aldosterone blockade might be secondary. But the question is about initial preparation. So the first line is definitely alpha-blockade.\n\nPossible options in the question (though not listed here) would include phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin, maybe prazosin. Alternatively, if it were Conn's, spironolactone, but that's not the case here. So the correct answer is an alpha-blocker. The question is probably expecting phenoxybenzamine as the traditional agent, but sometimes doxazosin is used now because it's more convenient. However, the key is that it's an alpha-blocker. Since the user hasn't given options, but in real test scenarios, the answer would be an alpha-adrenergic blocker.\n</think>\n\nThe patient presents with a large left adrenal mass, elevated urinary metanephrines/normetanephrines, and elevated plasma aldosterone. The elevated metanephrines strongly suggest **pheochromocytoma**, as these are metabolites of catecholamines. While the elevated aldosterone could indicate co-secretion (rare) or a separate aldosterone-producing adenoma, the clinical priority is managing the pheochromocytoma given the risk of hypertensive crisis during surgery. \n\n### Key Considerations:\n1. **Pheochromocytoma Preoperative Management**:\n   - **Alpha-Adrenergic Blockade**: Essential to block peripheral catecholamine effects and prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises. \n   - **Choice of Agent**: \n     - **Phenoxybenzamine** (non-selective, irreversible) is the traditional first-line agent, allowing gradual titration. \n     - **Doxazosin/Prazosin** (selective alpha-1 blockers) are alternatives, often preferred for better tolerability. \n   - **Beta-Blockers**: Added **only after adequate alpha blockade** to avoid unopposed alpha-mediated hypertension.\n\n2. **Aldosterone Considerations**:\n   - While elevated aldosterone might warrant spironolactone/eplerenone, this is secondary to managing the pheochromocytoma. The normal electrolytes suggest aldosterone effects are not yet clinically significant.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **initial preoperative preparation** must focus on **alpha-adrenergic blockade** to mitigate perioperative risks. The correct answer is an **alpha-blocker** (e.g., phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin, or prazosin). \n\n**Answer:** Alpha-adrenergic blocker (e.g., phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin)."

The normal electrolytes suggest aldosterone effects are not yet clinically significant.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe **initial preoperative preparation** must focus on **alpha-adrenergic blockade** to mitigate perioperative risks.
