        "question": "The energy for all forms of muscle contraction is provided by:",
        "response": "The energy for all forms of muscle contraction is provided by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is a molecule that stores and transfers energy within cells. When a muscle contracts, ATP is broken down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), releasing energy that is used to power the contraction. The process of breaking down ATP to release energy is known as ATP hydrolysis. The energy released from ATP hydrolysis is used to power the movement of myosin heads, which are the motor proteins responsible for muscle contraction. The myosin heads bind to actin filaments in the muscle fibers and use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pull the actin filaments towards the center of the muscle fiber, causing the muscle to contract."
