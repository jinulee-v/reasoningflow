        "response": "Okay, so the question is about Moore's \"ideal utilitarianism\" and what the right action is according to that theory. The user is asking for the answer to fill in the blank: \"the right action is the one that brings about the greatest amount of: ...\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Moore's ideal utilitarianism is. I know that utilitarianism generally focuses on maximizing some form of utility, often happiness or pleasure. But Moore's version is called \"ideal\" utilitarianism, which might mean it's different from the classical versions like Bentham's or Mill's.\n\nFrom what I remember, G.E. Moore was a philosopher who contributed to ethics, and his work \"Principia Ethica\" might be relevant here. In that book, he discusses intrinsic values, which are things valuable in themselves. Traditional utilitarianism, like Bentham's, considers pleasure as the sole intrinsic good, but Moore argued that there are multiple intrinsic goods, such as beauty, knowledge, and friendship. So, ideal utilitarianism would consider these as part of what contributes to the overall good.\n\nTherefore, the right action under Moore's theory isn't just about maximizing pleasure but maximizing the overall intrinsic good, which includes various ideals. So the answer should be something like \"intrinsic value\" or \"goodness,\" encompassing all these ideals. But I need to check if Moore specifically used a term like \"good\" or \"intrinsic value.\"\n\nLooking up briefly, Moore's ideal utilitarianism posits that the right action maximizes the amount of good in the world, where \"good\" is understood as a pluralistic combination of intrinsic values. So the answer is probably \"good\" or \"intrinsic good.\" But I want to make sure. Some sources say Moore's theory evaluates actions based on their production of intrinsic value, which includes but isn't limited to happiness. So the greatest amount of intrinsic good, perhaps.\n\nWait, but the standard phrasing for utilitarianism is \"greatest happiness for the greatest number,\" but Moore's version is different. So instead of happiness, it's the greatest amount of good, where good is a combination of various intrinsic values. Therefore, the answer should be \"good\" or \"intrinsic good.\" Let me confirm.\n\nYes, Moore's ideal utilitarianism argues that the right action is the one that produces the most intrinsic value, which includes things like beauty, knowledge, and relationships, not just pleasure. So the answer is \"intrinsic value\" or \"good.\" But the exact term Moore uses might be \"good\" as a noun. In his own words, he might say \"the greatest amount of good,\" where \"good\" is a non-natural property encompassing all intrinsic values.\n\nSo the correct answer here is \"good\" or \"the greatest amount of good.\" Let me check an example. If the question is a standard one from philosophy exams, the answer is usually \"good\" because Moore's utilitarianism is about maximizing good, which he defines more broadly than just pleasure. So the answer is \"good.\""
