        "question": "What are the two main dimensions of the Ohio Studies into leadership?",
        "response": "The Ohio State Studies on leadership identified two main dimensions of leadership behavior:\n\n1. **Initiating Structure**: This dimension refers to the extent to which a leader defines and structures their role and the roles of their subordinates to achieve goals. Leaders who are high in initiating structure are task-oriented, set clear expectations, and focus on organizing work, setting deadlines, and clarifying roles.\n\n2. **Consideration**: This dimension refers to the extent to which a leader shows concern and respect for their subordinates, looks out for their welfare, and expresses appreciation and support. Leaders who are high in consideration are relationship-oriented, empathetic, and focus on building trust and rapport with their team members.\n\nThese two dimensions are independent of each other, meaning a leader can be high or low on either or both dimensions. The studies found that effective leaders often exhibit a balance of both initiating structure and consideration."
