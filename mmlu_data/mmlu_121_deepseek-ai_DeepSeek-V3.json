        "question": "The short-run Phillips curve indicates a",
        "response": "The short-run Phillips curve illustrates an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation in the short term. Specifically, it suggests that as unemployment decreases, inflation tends to increase, and vice versa. This relationship is based on the idea that when demand for goods and services rises, businesses hire more workers, reducing unemployment. However, increased demand can also lead to higher prices (inflation) as resources become scarcer and production costs rise.\n\nThe short-run Phillips curve is influenced by expectations and other factors, such as wage and price stickiness, which allow for temporary trade-offs between inflation and unemployment. In the long run, however, the Phillips curve becomes vertical, indicating that there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment, as inflation expectations adjust and the economy returns to its natural rate of unemployment."
