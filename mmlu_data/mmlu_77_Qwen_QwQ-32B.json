        "question": "A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?",
        "response": "Okay, so there's this problem here about figuring out how many teams are needed for 30 basketball players, with each team having exactly 5 players. Let me think through this step by step. \n\nFirst off, the question is asking for the number of teams required. Each team has 5 players, and there are 30 players total. Hmm, so I guess the basic idea is to divide the total number of players by the number of players per team. That should give the number of teams, right?\n\nLet me write that down. If there are 30 players and each team has 5, then the number of teams would be 30 divided by 5. Let me do that calculation: 30 \u00f7 5 equals 6. So, does that mean 6 teams? That seems straightforward, but maybe I should check if there's a trick here. Sometimes problems can have hidden details, like whether all teams need to have exactly 5 or if they can have fewer. But the problem says \"exactly 5 players on each team,\" so we can't have a team with fewer. That means we have to make sure that when we divide, there's no remainder. \n\nWait, 30 divided by 5 is exactly 6, so there's no remainder. That works out perfectly. So, there's no issue here. Each of the 6 teams will have exactly 5 players. \n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the question is trying to test something else? Like, sometimes in sports, you have to consider how many teams can play at the same time, but the problem doesn't mention anything about courts or simultaneous games. It just asks for the number of teams needed. So probably it's just a straightforward division problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to see if I consider that basketball is usually played with two teams at a time, like a game has two teams. But the question says \"a total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team.\" It doesn't specify how many games or how the teams are structured beyond each having 5 players. So maybe it's just the total number of teams, regardless of how they are paired up for games. \n\nSo, if you have 30 players and each team must have 5, then the number of teams is 30 divided by 5, which is 6. Therefore, the correct statement should be that you divide 30 by 5 to get 6 teams. \n\nLet me see if there's another way someone might approach this. Maybe using multiplication? Like, 5 players per team times how many teams equals 30 players. So 5 \u00d7 ? = 30. Then, solving for the question mark gives 30 \u00f7 5 = 6. Yeah, that's the same result. \n\nAlternatively, if someone tried adding 5 repeatedly until reaching 30: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. That's 6 teams. \n\nHmm, all methods point to 6 teams. The problem is probably testing division in the context of grouping items (players) into equal subsets (teams). Since 5 \u00d7 6 = 30, the division 30 \u00f7 5 = 6 gives the number of teams. \n\nI don't see any complications here. The key points are: total players, players per team, and needing whole teams. Since it divides evenly, there's no need to round up or anything. \n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that you divide the total number of players (30) by the number of players per team (5), resulting in 6 teams. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of teams needed is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of teams needed for 30 basketball players with each team consisting of exactly 5 players, we perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of players**: 30 players.\n2. **Identify the number of players per team**: 5 players.\n3. **Divide the total number of players by the number of players per team**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30}{5} = 6\n   \\]\n\nThis calculation shows that 30 players divided into teams of 5 results in 6 teams. Since the division is exact (no remainder), there is no need for rounding. \n\nThus, the number of teams needed is \\boxed{6}."
