        "question": "Beyond the business case for engaging in CSR there are a number of moral arguments relating to: negative _______, the _______that corporations possess and the ________ of business and society.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to fill in the blanks for this sentence about moral arguments for CSR beyond the business case. The sentence is: \"Beyond the business case for engaging in CSR there are a number of moral arguments relating to: negative _______, the _______that corporations possess and the ________ of business and society.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down each blank. The first one is \"negative _______\". Common terms related to CSR and moral arguments might be \"externalities\" because negative externalities are costs that affect third parties, which companies might have a moral duty to address. That makes sense here.\n\nThe second blank is \"the _______ that corporations possess\". This seems like it's referring to some kind of power or influence. Corporations have significant power in society, so maybe \"power\" or \"influence\". But the phrase \"the _______ that corporations possess\" \u2013 perhaps \"responsibility\" but that's part of CSR already. Wait, maybe \"resources\"? Or \"stake\"? Hmm. Wait, another possibility is \"the duty that corporations possess\" but that might not fit. Alternatively, \"the influence that corporations possess\" but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe \"the obligations that corporations possess\"? No, that's not quite right. Wait, another term used in CSR discussions is \"corporate social responsibility\" itself, but here they're talking about moral arguments. Maybe \"the power that corporations possess\" because with great power comes responsibility. Yeah, that could be it. So \"power\" might fit here.\n\nThird blank: \"the ________ of business and society\". This is likely about the interconnectedness or mutual dependence. Terms like \"interdependence\" or \"integration\" come to mind. The relationship between business and society is often discussed in terms of interdependence, so \"interdependence\" might be the right word here.\n\nLet me check each part again. First blank: negative externalities. Yes, that's a common term in economics and CSR. Companies causing negative externalities have a moral duty to mitigate them.\n\nSecond blank: power. Corporations have significant power in society, so they have a moral responsibility to use that power ethically. That makes sense.\n\nThird blank: interdependence. The idea that business and society are interdependent, meaning they rely on each other, so businesses have a moral obligation to contribute positively to society.\n\nPutting it all together: negative externalities, the power that corporations possess, and the interdependence of business and society. That seems to fit well. Let me see if there are alternative terms. For the second blank, maybe \"resources\" instead of \"power\"? But \"resources\" might not capture the moral obligation as directly as \"power\" does. Power implies influence and responsibility. For the third blank, \"integration\" could work, but \"interdependence\" is more commonly used in this context. So I think the answers are externalities, power, and interdependence."
