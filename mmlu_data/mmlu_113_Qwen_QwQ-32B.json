        "question": "The practice of hiring a foreign third-party service provider to run an operation is called",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what the term is for hiring a foreign third-party service provider to run an operation. Let me start by breaking down the question. The key elements here are \"hiring,\" \"foreign,\" \"third-party service provider,\" and \"run an operation.\" \n\nFirst, I know that when companies hire external companies to handle certain functions, that's generally called outsourcing. But the question specifies that the service provider is foreign. So maybe it's a specific type of outsourcing that involves international companies. \n\nI remember terms like offshoring and outsourcing. Wait, aren't those similar? Let me think. Outsourcing is when you hire an external company, regardless of their location. Offshoring specifically refers to moving operations to another country, which could be done either by relocating your own employees or by outsourcing to a foreign company. So if a company hires a foreign third party, that might be offshoring through outsourcing. But is there a more precise term?\n\nAnother term that comes to mind is \"offshore outsourcing.\" That seems to combine both the outsourcing and the foreign aspect. Let me verify that. Yes, offshore outsourcing is when a company contracts a third-party provider in another country to perform services that were previously done in-house or domestically. That fits the description here. \n\nWait, but could there be another term? Maybe \"international outsourcing\" or \"global outsourcing\"? I think offshore outsourcing is the more commonly used term. Let me check some examples. For instance, when a U.S. company hires a software development firm in India, that's offshore outsourcing. Similarly, customer service centers in the Philippines for foreign companies are examples of offshore outsourcing. \n\nIs there any chance the question is referring to something else? Maybe \"outsourcing\" alone is the answer, but since it specifies \"foreign,\" the more precise term would be offshore outsourcing. Let me see if there's a standard business term for this. \n\nLooking up some definitions: Outsourcing is the contracting out of a business process to a third party, which can be domestic or international. Offshoring is the movement of employment to another country, which can be done by either relocating employees or outsourcing. Therefore, when you outsource to a foreign company, it's both outsourcing and offshoring, but the combined term is offshore outsourcing. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use \"offshore\" as a verb, like \"to offshore,\" but the noun form would be offshore outsourcing. \n\nAnother angle: The question says \"the practice of hiring a foreign third-party service provider to run an operation.\" The key here is that it's a third party (so not a subsidiary) and foreign. So the term should encapsulate both aspects. \n\nI think offshore outsourcing is the correct term here. Let me see if there's any other possible answer. Maybe \"contracting out internationally\" but that's not a standard term. \"Third-party foreign contracting\" is too generic. \n\nAlternatively, \"offshore business process outsourcing (BPO)\" is a specific type, but the question doesn't mention business processes specifically. \n\nTherefore, the most accurate and commonly accepted term is offshore outsourcing. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe practice of hiring a foreign third-party service provider to run an operation is called **offshore outsourcing**. \n\n### Explanation:\n- **Outsourcing** refers to contracting a third party to perform services that were previously handled internally. \n- **Offshoring** specifically involves moving these services to another country. \n- **Offshore outsourcing** combines both concepts, emphasizing the use of an external provider located in a different country. This is commonly used in contexts like IT services, customer support, manufacturing, and other business processes where companies seek cost efficiencies, specialized expertise, or other advantages from foreign providers. \n\nThis term is widely recognized in business and economics to describe the strategic decision to engage foreign third parties for operational tasks."
