        "question": "A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, can be added to this solution before the pH changes significantly. The solution has 2.00 moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate (Ca(CH3COO)2). \n\nFirst, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and calcium acetate is its conjugate base because acetate ions (CH3COO-) come from the salt. So this solution is a buffer solution. Buffer solutions resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. The buffer capacity is determined by the amounts of the weak acid and its conjugate base present. \n\nIn this case, the acetic acid is the weak acid, and the acetate ion from calcium acetate is the conjugate base. The problem is asking how much nitric acid can be added before the buffer is overwhelmed, causing a significant pH change. \n\nNitric acid is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely in solution, providing H+ ions. The H+ ions will react with the conjugate base in the buffer, which is the acetate ion (CH3COO-). The reaction should be: H+ + CH3COO- \u2192 CH3COOH. \n\nSo, each mole of HNO3 added will donate one mole of H+, which will react with one mole of acetate ion, converting it into acetic acid. Therefore, the amount of HNO3 that can be neutralized by the buffer is equal to the moles of acetate ion present. \n\nBut wait, calcium acetate is Ca(CH3COO)2. Each formula unit of calcium acetate releases two acetate ions when dissolved. So, 1.00 mole of calcium acetate will dissociate into 1.00 mole of Ca^2+ and 2.00 moles of CH3COO-. \n\nTherefore, the total moles of acetate ions in the solution are 2.00 moles. The acetic acid is 2.00 moles, which is the weak acid component. \n\nSo, the buffer has 2.00 moles of acetic acid and 2.00 moles of acetate ion. Wait, no. Wait, the acetic acid is 2.00 moles, and calcium acetate provides 2.00 moles of acetate. So the buffer is made of 2.00 moles CH3COOH and 2.00 moles CH3COO-. \n\nBut when we add HNO3, which is a strong acid, the H+ ions will react with the acetate ions. Each mole of H+ will neutralize one mole of acetate ion, turning it into acetic acid. So the maximum amount of HNO3 that can be added before the buffer is exhausted is equal to the moles of acetate ions available. \n\nIn this case, there are 2.00 moles of acetate ions. So adding 2.00 moles of HNO3 would consume all the acetate ions, converting them into acetic acid. After that, any additional HNO3 would not be neutralized by the buffer, and the pH would drop significantly. \n\nWait, but the problem states that the solution contains 2.00 moles of acetic acid and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate. So calcium acetate gives 2.00 moles of acetate ions. So total acetate is 2.00 moles, and acetic acid is 2.00 moles. \n\nSo the buffer capacity for adding strong acid is determined by the amount of conjugate base (acetate) present. Each mole of strong acid added will consume a mole of acetate. Therefore, the maximum moles of HNO3 that can be added before the buffer is overwhelmed is equal to the moles of acetate, which is 2.00 moles. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. The initial moles of acetic acid are 2.00, and calcium acetate is 1.00 mole. Calcium acetate dissociates into Ca^2+ and 2 moles of acetate ions. So total acetate ions = 2.00 moles. \n\nSo when HNO3 is added, it will donate H+ ions. The H+ will react with acetate ions:\n\nH+ + CH3COO- \u2192 CH3COOH\n\nSo each mole of HNO3 adds one H+, which converts one mole of CH3COO- to CH3COOH. \n\nTherefore, the maximum amount of HNO3 that can be added is equal to the moles of CH3COO- available, which is 2.00 moles. Once all the acetate ions are consumed, adding more HNO3 will increase the H+ concentration significantly, causing a sharp change in pH. \n\nBut wait, the acetic acid is already present. Wait, initially, we have 2.00 moles of CH3COOH and 2.00 moles of CH3COO-. So the buffer is made of equal parts acid and conjugate base. The pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). Since [A-] = [HA], the pH is equal to the pKa of acetic acid. \n\nWhen we add HNO3, which is a strong acid, it will add H+ ions. The H+ ions will react with the acetate ions (A-), converting them into acetic acid (HA). So each mole of H+ added will decrease the moles of A- and increase the moles of HA. \n\nSo initially, moles of HA = 2.00, moles of A- = 2.00. \n\nIf we add x moles of HNO3, then moles of HA becomes 2.00 + x, and moles of A- becomes 2.00 - x. \n\nThe buffer will be effective until one of the components is exhausted. Since we are adding acid, the A- (conjugate base) is the component that will be consumed. So when x = 2.00, moles of A- = 0, and moles of HA = 4.00. At this point, there's no more conjugate base left to neutralize additional H+ ions. Therefore, adding more than 2.00 moles of HNO3 will cause a significant change in pH. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"how many moles of nitric acid may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?\" So the answer should be 2.00 moles? \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The buffer capacity is the amount of acid or base that can be added before the pH changes significantly. For a buffer, the buffer capacity is usually considered as the amount of strong acid or base that can be added before the ratio of [A-]/[HA] changes by a factor of 10, which would change the pH by 1 unit. But in some cases, especially in textbook problems, they might consider the buffer capacity as the amount of acid or base that can be neutralized by the buffer components. \n\nIn this case, since the problem mentions that \"larger quantities of strong acid or base can cause a significant change in pH,\" it's likely that the buffer can neutralize an amount of acid equal to the moles of conjugate base present. So adding up to 2.00 moles of HNO3 would be neutralized by the 2.00 moles of acetate ions, converting them into acetic acid. After that, any additional HNO3 would not be buffered and would lower the pH drastically. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2.00 moles of HNO3. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another factor. Calcium acetate is a salt of a divalent cation, Ca^2+, but in solution, it's dissociated into Ca^2+ and 2 acetate ions. The Ca^2+ is a spectator ion and doesn't participate in the acid-base reaction here. So the only relevant components are the acetate ions and acetic acid. \n\nAnother thing to consider: nitric acid is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ ions which react with the acetate ions. The reaction is as I wrote before. \n\nSo yes, the maximum moles of HNO3 that can be added before the buffer is overwhelmed is equal to the moles of acetate ions available, which is 2.00 moles. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.00 moles. \n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says the solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate. So calcium acetate is 1.00 mole, which gives 2.00 moles of acetate ions. So total acetate ions is 2.00, acetic acid is 2.00. \n\nSo when adding HNO3, each mole of HNO3 adds 1 mole of H+, which reacts with 1 mole of acetate ion. So adding 2.00 moles of HNO3 would consume all 2.00 moles of acetate ions, converting them to acetic acid. Then, the solution would have 4.00 moles of acetic acid and 0 moles of acetate ions. At this point, the buffer capacity is exhausted, and further addition of HNO3 would significantly lower the pH. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 2.00 moles of HNO3 can be added before the pH changes significantly. \n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes, the buffer capacity is considered as the point where the buffering capacity is significantly reduced, not completely exhausted. For example, when the concentration of the conjugate base is less than 10% of the acid, or vice versa. But the problem here says \"begins to change significantly,\" which might imply the point where the buffer is no longer effective, i.e., when one component is used up. \n\nIn many textbook problems, when they ask how much strong acid or base can be added before the pH changes significantly, they are referring to the buffer capacity, which is the amount of acid/base that the buffer can neutralize. So in this case, since the conjugate base (acetate) can neutralize 2.00 moles of H+ (from HNO3), the answer is 2.00 moles. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 2.00 moles of HNO3. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of moles of nitric acid that may be added before the pH begins to change significantly is \\boxed{2.00}."
