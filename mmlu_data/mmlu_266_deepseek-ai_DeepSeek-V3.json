        "question": "What does Berger (1963) describe as a metaphor for social reality?",
        "response": "In his influential work *Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective* (1963), Peter L. Berger describes **\"the social construction of reality\"** as a metaphor for understanding social reality. Berger, along with Thomas Luckmann, argues that social reality is not an objective, fixed entity but rather a dynamic, ongoing process constructed through human interaction and shared meanings. \n\nThe metaphor emphasizes that society is like a **\"stage\"** where individuals play roles, and these roles are shaped by cultural norms, institutions, and collective agreements. Social reality is thus seen as a **\"human product\"** that is continuously created, maintained, and transformed through social interactions. This perspective highlights the importance of understanding how people collectively create and sustain the world they live in, often taking it for granted as \"natural\" or \"given.\""
