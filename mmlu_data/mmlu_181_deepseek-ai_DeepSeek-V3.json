This type of question is designed to trap the respondent into accepting the presupposition, regardless of how they answer.\n\nFor example, consider the question: \"Have you stopped cheating on your taxes?\" This question presupposes that the respondent has cheated on their taxes in the past. Whether the respondent answers \"yes\" or \"no,\" they are implicitly admitting to having cheated on their taxes at some point.\n\nThe fallacy lies in the fact that the question is structured to force the respondent into a position where they must accept the underlying assumption, even if it is false or unproven. This can be a manipulative tactic in arguments or interrogations, as it can lead the respondent to inadvertently concede a point they do not actually agree with.\n\nTo avoid this fallacy, it is important to ensure that questions are neutral and do not contain hidden assumptions or accusations. If a question does contain a presupposition, it should be addressed separately before answering the question itself."
