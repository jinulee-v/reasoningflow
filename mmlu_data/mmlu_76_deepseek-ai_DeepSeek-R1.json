        "question": "Olivia used the rule \"Add 11\" to create the number pattern shown below. 10, 21, 32, 43, 54 Which statement about the number pattern is true?",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. Olivia used the rule \"Add 11\" to create the number pattern: 10, 21, 32, 43, 54. The question is asking which statement about this pattern is true. Hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't list the possible statements. Maybe they were included in the original problem but got cut off here? Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the options, it's hard to figure out exactly which statement is true. But maybe I can think of common statements that might be presented for such a pattern and evaluate them. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the pattern. Starting at 10 and adding 11 each time: 10 + 11 is 21, then 21 + 11 is 32, then 32 + 11 is 43, and 43 + 11 is 54. Yep, that's correct. So the pattern is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 11, starting at 10.\n\nCommon statements for such patterns might be about whether numbers are even or odd, whether they fall into certain categories like multiples of a number, or perhaps about specific properties of the terms. Let me think of possible statements:\n\n1. All numbers are odd.\n2. All numbers are even.\n3. The numbers alternate between even and odd.\n4. All numbers are multiples of 11.\n5. Each number is 11 more than the previous one.\n6. The pattern will include the number 65.\n7. The tenth term is 110.\n8. The sum of the digits of each number is 10.\n\nWait, let's check these one by one.\n\n1. All numbers are odd: Let's see. 10 is even, 21 is odd, 32 is even, 43 is odd, 54 is even. So they alternate between even and odd. So statement 1 is false.\n\n2. All numbers are even: Again, 10, 32, 54 are even, but 21 and 43 are odd. So statement 2 is false.\n\n3. The numbers alternate between even and odd: Starting with 10 (even), then 21 (odd), 32 (even), 43 (odd), 54 (even). Yes, they alternate. So statement 3 is true.\n\n4. All numbers are multiples of 11: Let's check. 10 divided by 11 is not an integer. 21 divided by 11 is 1.909..., not an integer. So statement 4 is false.\n\n5. Each number is 11 more than the previous one: Well, that's the rule given. So statement 5 is true. But since the rule is explicitly stated, maybe this is a trick question? Wait, but the problem says \"which statement about the number pattern is true,\" so maybe the options include both 3 and 5? But depending on the options, both could be true. Wait, but statement 5 is more about the rule itself rather than a property of the numbers. If the options are about properties, maybe statement 3 is the answer. Hmm.\n\n6. The pattern will include the number 65: Let's see. Starting at 10, adding 11 each time. Let's see: 10, 21, 32, 43, 54, 65, 76... So yes, 65 is the next term after 54. So if the pattern continues, 65 is included. But the original pattern shown is up to 54. Depending on the statement, if it says \"the pattern shown includes 65,\" that's false. But if it says \"the pattern will include 65 if continued,\" then that's true. So depends on the exact wording.\n\n7. The tenth term is 110: Let's calculate. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 is 10, d is 11. So the tenth term is 10 + (10-1)*11 = 10 + 9*11 = 10 + 99 = 109. So statement 7 is false.\n\n8. The sum of the digits of each number is 10: Let's check each term:\n\n10: 1 + 0 = 1. Not 10. So statement 8 is false.\n\nSo among the statements I thought of, statements 3, 5, and 6 (if continued) are true. But since the problem mentions \"the number pattern shown below,\" which is up to 54, statement 6 might not be considered unless specified. Statement 5 is about the rule, which is given, so maybe that's redundant. Statement 3 is a property of the numbers in the pattern. So if the options include statement 3 and 5, both could be correct, but likely the answer expected is statement 3.\n\nBut since I don't have the actual statements, this is speculative. However, common questions for such patterns often ask about the alternating even and odd terms because adding an odd number (11) to an even number gives an odd, then adding 11 (odd) to an odd number gives even, etc. So that alternation is a key property.\n\nAlternatively, another possible statement could be about all numbers ending with 0,1,2,3,4 which they do: 10 ends with 0, 21 with 1, 32 with 2, 43 with 3, 54 with 4. So the next would end with 5, then 6, etc. So maybe a statement like \"The ones digit increases by 1 each term.\" Let's check:\n\n10: 0\n\n21:1\n\n32:2\n\n43:3\n\n54:4\n\nYes, the ones digit is increasing by 1 each time. Because when you add 11, which is 10 +1, you're adding 10, which doesn't change the ones digit, but adding 1, so the ones digit increases by 1 each time. So the ones digit cycles 0,1,2,3,4,5,... So that's another true statement.\n\nSo if the options include that, that's also true. For example, \"The ones digit of each number increases by 1 each term.\" That would be true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"All numbers are two-digit numbers.\" Since starting at 10, adding 11 repeatedly: 10,21,32,43,54,65,76,87,98,109,... So up to 98 they are two-digit, but 109 is three-digit. But in the given pattern, all shown numbers are two-digit. So if the statement is \"All numbers in the pattern are two-digit numbers,\" then for the given pattern up to 54, that's true. But if continued, eventually it becomes three-digit. So depending on the statement's wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a statement about the tens digit increasing by 1 each time. Let's check:\n\n10: tens digit is 1\n\n21: tens digit is 2\n\n32: tens digit is 3\n\n43: tens digit is 4\n\n54: tens digit is 5\n\nSo yes, the tens digit increases by 1 each term. Because adding 11 is adding 10 +1, so the tens digit goes up by 1, and the ones digit goes up by 1. So both digits increase by 1 each time. So that's another true statement.\n\nSo if the options include \"The tens digit increases by 1 each term,\" that's true.\n\nGiven that, there could be multiple true statements. But without the actual options, it's hard to know. However, common core math problems often focus on the alternating even and odd, or the ones/tens digit patterns.\n\nWait, let's recap:\n\n- Starting at 10.\n\n- Each term, add 11.\n\n- The terms are 10, 21, 32, 43, 54.\n\nProperties:\n\n- Each term is 11 more than the previous (explicit rule).\n\n- Alternates even, odd, even, odd, etc.\n\n- Ones digit increases by 1 each term: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\n- Tens digit increases by 1 each term: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n- All terms in the shown pattern are two-digit numbers.\n\n- The difference between consecutive terms is 11.\n\nSo possible true statements could be any of these. But since the user hasn't provided the options, I need to think which of these is most likely the answer expected.\n\nGiven that the rule is \"Add 11,\" a common follow-up question is about the parity (even/odd) of the terms, leading to the alternating pattern. So likely the correct answer is that the numbers alternate between even and odd.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is from a test or worksheet, another common true statement is about the digits increasing by 1 each time. For example, in 10, the digits are 1 and 0; next term 21 (2 and 1), then 32 (3 and 2), etc. So each subsequent number has digits that are each 1 higher than the previous. So 10 -> 21 (1+1=2, 0+1=1), 21->32 (2+1=3,1+1=2), etc. So that's another possible true statement: \"Each number has digits that are each 1 greater than the digits of the previous number.\" But that's a bit more complex.\n\nAlternatively, \"The tens digit is one more than the tens digit of the previous number,\" which is true, as we saw.\n\nBut again, without seeing the actual answer choices, it's challenging. However, given common curriculum standards for arithmetic sequences, especially in lower grades, the even/odd alternation is a key property when adding an odd number repeatedly. Since 11 is odd, adding it to an even number gives an odd, adding it to an odd gives even, hence alternation. That's a fundamental property they might test.\n\nAlternatively, another angle: If the question is from a multiple-choice test, and the options are similar to the ones I listed, the most probably correct answer is that the numbers alternate between even and odd.\n\nAlternatively, if the options include something about the digits, like the ones digit increasing by 1 each time, that's also true.\n\nWait, let's check the sum of the digits:\n\n10: 1+0=1\n\n21:2+1=3\n\n32:3+2=5\n\n43:4+3=7\n\n54:5+4=9\n\nSo the sums are 1,3,5,7,9\u2014they increase by 2 each time, forming an arithmetic sequence themselves. So the sum of the digits is odd and increases by 2. That's another property, but I don't know if that's one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a statement like \"All numbers are composite.\" Let's check:\n\n10: composite (factors: 2,5)\n\n21: composite (3,7)\n\n32: composite (2, 16, etc.)\n\n43: prime (yes, 43 is a prime number)\n\n54: composite\n\nSo since 43 is prime, the statement \"All numbers are composite\" is false.\n\nAlternatively, \"All numbers are greater than 10.\" Well, the first number is 10, which is not greater than 10. So that's false.\n\nAlternatively, \"The numbers are in increasing order.\" Well, yes, each subsequent number is larger, so that's true, but that's trivial since you're adding 11 each time.\n\nBut likely, the question is targeting a non-trivial property.\n\nGiven that, I think the most probable true statements are either:\n\n- The numbers alternate between even and odd.\n\n- The ones digit increases by 1 each term.\n\n- The tens digit increases by 1 each term.\n\nSince these are all true, but depending on the options given.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"the rule 'Add 11' to create the number pattern shown below. 10, 21, 32, 43, 54. Which statement about the number pattern is true?\"\n\nAssuming common options, such as:\n\nA) All numbers are even.\n\nB) All numbers are odd.\n\nC) The numbers alternate between even and odd.\n\nD) All numbers are multiples of 11.\n\nIn this case, C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another set of options:\n\nA) The ones digit is always even.\n\nB) The tens digit is one more than the ones digit.\n\nC) Each number is 10 more than the previous number.\n\nD) The sum of the digits is always even.\n\nLet's check these:\n\nA) Ones digit: 0 (even),1 (odd),2 (even),3 (odd),4 (even). So alternates. So A is false.\n\nB) Tens digit vs ones digit: 10: 1 vs 0 (1 is not one more than 0, since 0 +1=1, which is the tens digit). Wait, 10: tens is 1, ones is 0. 1 = 0 +1. So yes. 21: tens is 2, ones is 1. 2 =1 +1. 32: 3=2+1. 43:4=3+1. 54:5=4+1. So yes, B is true.\n\nC) Each number is 10 more: No, it's 11 more. So C is false.\n\nD) Sum of digits: 1,3,5,7,9 which are all odd. So D is false.\n\nSo in this case, B is true.\n\nAlternatively, if the options are:\n\nA) The pattern includes the number 11.\n\nB) The numbers are all even.\n\nC) The ones digit increases by 1 each term.\n\nD) The numbers are decreasing.\n\nThen C is true.\n\nSo depending on the options, different answers. But since the user hasn't provided them, I need to think based on common questions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a state test or a textbook. For example, in Go Math or enVision Math, common properties are tested.\n\nAlternatively, think of another angle: The starting number is 10, adding 11 each time. So each number can be represented as 10 + 11(n-1), where n is the term number. So term 1:10, term2:21, etc.\n\nExpressed another way, 11n -1. Because 11(1) -1=10, 11(2)-1=21, etc. So each term is one less than a multiple of 11. Therefore, if a statement says \"Each number is one less than a multiple of 11,\" that's true. Let's check:\n\n10 = 11*1 -1=11-1=10\n\n21=11*2 -1=22-1=21\n\n32=11*3 -1=33-1=32\n\nYes, that works. So another true statement.\n\nBut again, without the options, it's hard. However, given the prevalence of questions about even/odd alternation when adding an odd number, that's a strong candidate.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is presented to a student who might have to choose from several options, and given the initial terms, the alternation of even and odd is immediately observable, whereas the other properties might require more steps.\n\nGiven that, I think the most probable correct answer is that the numbers alternate between even and odd. Therefore, the statement \"The numbers alternate between even and odd\" is true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{The numbers alternate between even and odd.}"
