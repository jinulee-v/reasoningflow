In some regions, iodine is also added to bread and other foods.\n\n3. **Deficiency Risks**: Iodine deficiency can lead to health issues such as goiter (enlarged thyroid gland), hypothyroidism, and developmental delays in children, including intellectual disabilities.\n\n4. **Global Efforts**: The World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations have promoted iodized salt programs to combat iodine deficiency, which has significantly reduced its prevalence globally.\n\n5. **Excess Intake**: While iodine is essential, excessive intake can also cause health problems, such as hyperthyroidism or thyroiditis.\n\n6. **Pregnancy and Lactation**: Adequate iodine intake is particularly important during pregnancy and lactation to support fetal and infant brain development.\n\n7. **Environmental Factors**: Soil iodine content varies geographically, which can affect the iodine levels in crops and, consequently, the dietary intake of populations in those areas.\n\nIf you have specific statements in mind, feel free to share them for verification!"
