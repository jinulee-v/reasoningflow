        "question": "Two long parallel conductors carry 100 A. If the conductors are separated by 20 mm, the force per meter of length of each conductor will be",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two long parallel conductors carrying 100 A each, separated by 20 mm, and I need to find the force per meter of each conductor. Hmm, let me think. I remember there's a formula for the force between two parallel current-carrying wires. Was it something with the permeability of free space, the currents, and the distance between them?\n\nLet me recall. I think the force per unit length between two parallel conductors is given by F/L = (\u03bc\u2080 * I\u2081 * I\u2082) / (2\u03c0d), where \u03bc\u2080 is the permeability of free space, I\u2081 and I\u2082 are the currents, and d is the distance between them. Since both currents are the same here, 100 A, that should simplify things a bit.\n\nWait, let me confirm the formula. Yeah, I think that's right. The force per unit length is proportional to the product of the currents divided by the distance between them, multiplied by \u03bc\u2080 over 2\u03c0. So, plugging in the numbers should give me the answer.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given values:\n\nCurrent in each conductor, I\u2081 = I\u2082 = 100 A\n\nDistance between them, d = 20 mm. Oh, wait, the units here. The formula probably expects the distance in meters, right? Since standard SI units are used in physics formulas. So 20 mm is 0.02 meters.\n\nPermeability of free space, \u03bc\u2080 is a constant. I remember it's 4\u03c0 times 10 to the negative seventh Tesla meters per ampere. Let me write that down: \u03bc\u2080 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 T\u00b7m/A.\n\nSo substituting all into the formula:\n\nF/L = (\u03bc\u2080 * I\u2081 * I\u2082) / (2\u03c0d)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nF/L = (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 T\u00b7m/A * 100 A * 100 A) / (2\u03c0 * 0.02 m)\n\nHmm, let me compute this step by step. First, let's handle the numerator:\n\n4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 * 100 * 100\n\nThe 100 A and 100 A multiply to 10,000 A\u00b2. So:\n\n4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 * 10,000 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\n\nWait, 10\u207b\u2077 multiplied by 10\u2074 (since 100*100 is 10^4) gives 10\u207b\u00b3. So that's 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3.\n\nThen the denominator is 2\u03c0 * 0.02 m. Let's compute that:\n\n2\u03c0 * 0.02 = 0.04\u03c0\n\nSo putting numerator over denominator:\n\n(4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3) / (0.04\u03c0) = (4 / 0.04) \u00d7 (\u03c0 / \u03c0) \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\n\nThe \u03c0 cancels out, so that's 4 divided by 0.04. Let me compute that. 4 divided by 0.04 is the same as 4 divided by (4/100) which is 4 * (100/4) = 100. So that gives 100 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, F/L = 100 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 N/m, which is 0.1 N/m.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents or the arithmetic.\n\nStarting over:\n\nNumerator: 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 * 100 * 100 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 * 10\u2074 = 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\n\nDenominator: 2\u03c0 * 0.02 = 0.04\u03c0\n\nDivide numerator by denominator: (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3) / (0.04\u03c0) = (4 / 0.04) * 10\u207b\u00b3 = 100 * 10\u207b\u00b3 = 0.1 N/m.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the numerical values step by step without combining terms:\n\nFirst, \u03bc\u2080 is 4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077. Let's compute that numerically. \u03c0 is approximately 3.1416, so 4 * 3.1416 \u2248 12.566. So \u03bc\u2080 \u2248 12.566 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 T\u00b7m/A.\n\nThen, multiplying by I\u2081*I\u2082 = 100*100 = 10,000 A\u00b2:\n\n12.566 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 * 10,000 = 12.566 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 (since 10\u207b\u2077 * 10\u2074 = 10\u207b\u00b3)\n\nSo that gives 0.012566 T\u00b7m/A * A\u00b2 = 0.012566 T\u00b7m\u00b7A.\n\nWait, but then divide by 2\u03c0d. Let's compute denominator:\n\n2\u03c0d = 2 * \u03c0 * 0.02 m \u2248 2 * 3.1416 * 0.02 \u2248 0.12566 m.\n\nSo then, the total F/L is (0.012566) / 0.12566 \u2248 ?\n\nDividing 0.012566 by 0.12566. Let's see, 0.012566 / 0.12566 \u2248 0.1, since 0.12566 * 0.1 = 0.012566. Exactly. So that gives 0.1 N/m. So that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the force per meter is 0.1 Newtons per meter. Since the question says \"the force per meter of length of each conductor will be\", so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure about the direction? The problem doesn't ask for direction, just the magnitude, so 0.1 N/m is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the formula once again. The force between two parallel conductors: when currents are in the same direction, the force is attractive; opposite, repulsive. But since they just ask for the magnitude, direction isn't needed here.\n\nAnother way to remember the formula: The definition of the ampere is based on this force. Specifically, the current required so that two parallel conductors 1 meter apart experience a force of 2e-7 Newtons per meter. Wait, let me recall.\n\nYes, the ampere is defined such that the force between two infinitely long parallel conductors separated by 1 meter, each carrying 1 ampere, is 2e-7 Newtons per meter. So the formula comes from that definition.\n\nSo the general formula is F/L = (\u03bc\u2080 I\u2081 I\u2082)/(2\u03c0d). Since \u03bc\u2080/(4\u03c0) is the permeability over 4\u03c0, but here it's over 2\u03c0, so that's consistent with the definition.\n\nSo if you have two wires with current I, separated by d meters, then F/L = (\u03bc\u2080 I\u00b2)/(2\u03c0d). Since \u03bc\u2080 is 4\u03c0e-7, substituting that in gives F/L = (4\u03c0e-7 * I\u00b2)/(2\u03c0d) = (2e-7 * I\u00b2)/d. So that's another way to write it.\n\nSo plugging in I = 100 A, d = 0.02 m:\n\nF/L = (2e-7 * (100)^2)/0.02\n\nCompute numerator: 2e-7 * 10,000 = 2e-3\n\nThen divide by 0.02: 2e-3 / 0.02 = (2 / 0.02) * 1e-3 = 100 * 1e-3 = 0.1 N/m. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, I think that's solid. The answer is 0.1 N/m.\n\nWait, but let me check units to be thorough. Let's see:\n\n\u03bc\u2080 has units of T\u00b7m/A. Let's see:\n\nTesla is kg/(s\u00b2\u00b7A), so T\u00b7m/A would be (kg/(s\u00b2\u00b7A)) * m / A = kg\u00b7m/(s\u00b2\u00b7A\u00b2).\n\nCurrents are in Amperes, so I\u2081*I\u2082 is A\u00b2. Distance is in meters.\n\nSo putting into the formula:\n\n(\u03bc\u2080 * I\u00b2) / (2\u03c0d) has units (kg\u00b7m/(s\u00b2\u00b7A\u00b2) * A\u00b2) / m = kg/(s\u00b2) which is Newtons. Then divided by length (meters) gives N/m. So units check out.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So I think 0.1 N/m is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe force per meter of length of each conductor is \\boxed{0.1} N/m.\n</think>\n\nTo find the force per meter of length between two long parallel conductors carrying 100 A each and separated by 20 mm, we use the formula for the force per unit length between two parallel current-carrying wires:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F}{L} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\\pi d}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Current in each conductor, \\( I_1 = I_2 = 100 \\, \\text{A} \\)\n- Distance between the conductors, \\( d = 20 \\, \\text{mm} = 0.02 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Permeability of free space, \\( \\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{T\u00b7m/A} \\)\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{F}{L} = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{T\u00b7m/A}) \\times (100 \\, \\text{A}) \\times (100 \\, \\text{A})}{2\\pi \\times 0.02 \\, \\text{m}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator and denominator step-by-step:\n\n1. Numerator:\n   \\[\n   4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 100 \\times 100 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 10^4 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-3}\n   \\]\n\n2. Denominator:\n   \\[\n   2\\pi \\times 0.02 = 0.04\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. Dividing numerator by denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4\\pi \\times 10^{-3}}{0.04\\pi} = \\frac{4}{0.04} \\times 10^{-3} = 100 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.1 \\, \\text{N/m}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the force per meter of length of each conductor is \\boxed{0.1} N/m."

Numerator:\n   \\[\n   4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 100 \\times 100 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 10^4 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-3}\n   \\]\n\n2. Denominator:\n   \\[\n   2\\pi \\times 0.02 = 0.04\\pi\n   \\]\n\n3. Dividing numerator by denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4\\pi \\times 10^{-3}}{0.04\\pi} = \\frac{4}{0.04} \\times 10^{-3} = 100 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.1 \\, \\text{N/m}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the force per meter of length of each conductor is \\boxed{0.1} N/m.",
