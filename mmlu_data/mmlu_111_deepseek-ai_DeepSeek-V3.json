        "response": "During the third stage of the demographic transition model, the following characteristics are typically observed:\n\n1. **Declining Birth Rates**: Birth rates begin to decline due to factors such as increased access to contraception, urbanization, improved education (especially for women), and changing societal norms regarding family size.\n\n2. **Declining Death Rates**: Death rates continue to decline, but at a slower pace than in the second stage, as improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and nutrition become more widespread.\n\n3. **Slower Population Growth**: The rate of population growth slows down because the gap between birth rates and death rates narrows. However, the population may still be increasing, just at a reduced rate.\n\n4. **Economic and Social Changes**: Societies in this stage often experience industrialization, urbanization, and increased economic development. These changes contribute to the decline in birth rates as families may choose to have fewer children due to the higher costs of raising them in urban settings and the reduced need for large families in agricultural societies.\n\n5. **Aging Population**: As birth rates decline and life expectancy increases, the population may begin to age, leading to a higher proportion of elderly individuals relative to younger people.\n\nOverall, the third stage is characterized by a transition from high birth and death rates to lower birth and death rates, resulting in a more stable population growth rate."
