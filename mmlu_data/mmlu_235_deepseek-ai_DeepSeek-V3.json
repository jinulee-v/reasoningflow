        "response": "To determine the net cash provided by financing activities for Box, a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization, we need to focus on the transactions that are related to financing activities. Financing activities typically include transactions that involve obtaining resources from creditors or owners and repaying those resources.\n\nHere are the relevant transactions from the problem:\n\n1. **Proceeds from long-term debt**: $100,000\n\nThis transaction is a financing activity because it involves obtaining resources from creditors.\n\nThe other transactions listed are not related to financing activities:\n\n- **Proceeds from sale of investments**: This is an investing activity.\n- **Purchase of property, plant, and equipment**: This is also an investing activity.\n- **Loss on sale of investment**: This is related to investing activities and does not involve cash flow.\n\nTherefore, the only cash flow related to financing activities is the proceeds from long-term debt.\n\n**Net cash provided by financing activities**: $100,000\n\nSo, the amount that should be reported as net cash provided by financing activities in Box's statement of cash flows is **$100,000**."
