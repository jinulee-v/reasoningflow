        "question": "In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this genetics problem here. Let me read it again. It says that in a population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. The question is asking for the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer. And they mention the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Alright, so I need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equations here.\n\nFirst, let me recall the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The main equations are p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1 and p + q = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. The terms p\u00b2, 2pq, and q\u00b2 represent the genotype frequencies for AA, Aa, and aa respectively. Since the cancer is caused by the recessive allele b, I think that means the affected individuals are homozygous recessive (bb). So the frequency of bb individuals is given as 1/400. \n\nLet me write that down. The frequency of the recessive phenotype (which is the cancer here) is q\u00b2 = 1/400. Therefore, to find q, I need to take the square root of 1/400. The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 400 is 20, so q = 1/20. That would make q = 0.05. \n\nThen, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. So p is 0.95 and q is 0.05. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer. Carrying the b allele but not having the cancer would mean they are heterozygous, right? Because if they have the cancer, they must be homozygous recessive (bb). So the carriers are the ones with the genotype Bb (assuming B is the dominant allele). \n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg terms, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq. So plugging in the numbers, that would be 2 * 0.95 * 0.05. Let me calculate that. 2 times 0.95 is 1.9, and 1.9 times 0.05 is... 0.095. So that's 0.095, which is 9.5 per 100, or 95 per 1000. But the question asks for the proportion, so maybe as a fraction or decimal?\n\nWait, let me check again. The problem states 1 in 400 has the cancer, so q\u00b2 = 1/400. So q is sqrt(1/400) = 1/20, which is 0.05. Then p is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. Then 2pq is 2 * 0.95 * 0.05. Let me compute that again step by step. 0.95 multiplied by 0.05 is 0.0475, and then multiplied by 2 is 0.095. So that's 0.095. \n\nSo converting that to a fraction, 0.095 is 95/1000, which simplifies to 19/200. Hmm, 95 divided by 5 is 19, and 1000 divided by 5 is 200. So 19/200. Alternatively, as a proportion, it's 0.095. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me think again. The carriers are the heterozygotes, so 2pq. Since the disease is recessive, only the homozygous recessive individuals get the disease, so the carriers are indeed the heterozygotes. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the setup again. The problem says \"1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b\". So the cancer is caused by the recessive allele, which would mean that the genotype must be bb. So the frequency of bb is 1/400. Therefore, q\u00b2 = 1/400, so q is 1/20. \n\nTherefore, the frequency of carriers is 2pq = 2*(19/20)*(1/20). Wait, hold on, 1 - 1/20 is 19/20, so p is 19/20. Wait, no, 1 - 0.05 is 0.95, which is 19/20. So 19/20 times 1/20 times 2. Let me compute that as fractions. \n\n19/20 * 1/20 = 19/400. Then multiplied by 2 is 38/400. Simplify that, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 19/200. Which is 0.095. So that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the proportion of carriers is 19/200 or 0.095. So in terms of per 400 people, how many would that be? 0.095 * 400 is 38. So out of 400 people, 1 has the disease, and 38 are carriers. That seems reasonable. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way this could be interpreted. The problem says \"carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer\". Since the cancer is caused by the recessive allele, does that mean that having one copy (heterozygote) doesn't cause cancer? Yes, because it's recessive. So carriers (heterozygotes) don't develop the cancer. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, could there be an issue with penetrance? The problem says \"caused by a completely recessive allele\", so I think penetrance is 100%, so all bb individuals have the cancer, and no others. So that's straightforward. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems right. So the answer should be 2pq = 0.095, which is 9.5%, or as a fraction 19/200. \n\nWait, but let me check if the question is asking for the proportion in the population. Since 1/400 is the frequency of bb, then the rest are either BB or Bb. So total population is 400. 1 is bb, so 399 are not. The carriers are Bb, which is 2pq*N. But as a proportion, it's 2pq. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the answer as a fraction over 400? Let me see. The question says \"expected proportion of individuals\", so it's a proportion, so 0.095 or 95/1000 reduces to 19/200. Alternatively, 38/400, which is the same as 19/200. \n\nHmm, so 19/200 is the simplified fraction. Alternatively, 0.095 is the decimal. Depending on how the answer is expected. The question says \"proportion\", so either could be acceptable, but since they might want it in fraction terms, perhaps 19/200? Let me see if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. \n\nq\u00b2 = 1/400, so q = 1/20. Then p = 19/20. Then 2pq is 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = (38)/400 = 19/200. Yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, maybe the carriers are people who have one copy but don't show the trait. Since it's recessive, that's exactly the heterozygotes. So I think that's right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the population is in H-W equilibrium, so no other factors are affecting it. Since they mentioned that, maybe just to confirm that the H-W applies here. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 19/200, which is 0.095. So the proportion is 0.095, or 9.5%. \n\nWait, but let me check if the question is perhaps asking for the carrier frequency as a percentage of the total population. Since 1/400 is 0.0025, so q\u00b2 = 0.0025, so q = sqrt(0.0025) = 0.05. Then 2pq is 2*(0.95)*(0.05) = 0.095. So yes, that's 9.5%, so 0.095. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they want it as a fraction like 95/1000 or 19/200. Since 19 and 200 are both divisible by... 19 is a prime number, so 19/200 is simplest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 9.5%, but since they might want it in fraction terms, 19/200. Let me see the options they might have, but since the user hasn't given options, just needs the answer. \n\nWait, the user says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". So probably as a decimal or fraction. Since 19/200 is exact, but 0.095 is also exact. Hmm. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated something. Let me check once more. \n\nGiven that the frequency of bb is 1/400. So q\u00b2 = 1/400. Therefore, q = 1/20. Then p = 19/20. Then 2pq is 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = 38/400 = 19/200. So that's 0.095. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer in terms of 1/x? Like 1 in 5.26 or something? But probably not. Since they said proportion, so 0.095 is the proportion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to present it as a fraction. Let me see. 19/200 is 0.095. So either way is correct, but since the question says \"proportion\", either is okay, but maybe they prefer fractions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the recessive allele is b. Wait, the cancer is caused by the recessive allele b, so the affected individuals must be bb. So that part is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different notation where the dominant allele is B and recessive is b. So the carriers would be Bb. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, I think my calculations are correct. So I think the answer is 19/200 or 0.095. Since the problem says \"proportion\", either is acceptable, but in boxed form, maybe as a fraction. Let me check if 19/200 reduces further. 19 is a prime number, so no. So 19/200 is simplest. Alternatively, 0.095. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects it as a percentage? But the wording says \"proportion\", which is a number between 0 and 1. So 0.095 is the proportion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to write it as 9.5 x 10^-2? But probably just 0.095. \n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another way. Suppose the frequency of the recessive allele is q, so q\u00b2 = 1/400, so q = 1/20. Then the carrier frequency is 2pq = 2*(1 - q)*q. So 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = 38/400 = 19/200. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 19/200 or 0.095. Since the problem might expect the answer in a fractional form, but maybe as a decimal. Let me see if 19 divided by 200 is exactly 0.095. Yes, 200 x 0.095 = 19. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 0.095, which can be written as \\boxed{0.095} or \\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{200}}. Since the question says \"proportion\", either is acceptable, but maybe they prefer the fractional form. Let me check standard Hardy-Weinberg problems. Usually, they might present it as a decimal, but fractions are also common. Since 19/200 is exact, perhaps that's better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, 2*(0.95)*(0.05). Let me compute 0.95 * 0.05 first. 0.95 * 0.05 is 0.0475. Then times 2 is 0.095. Yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the carriers are people with one copy, so 2pq, but maybe they want the answer in terms of the total population. Since 1 in 400 is affected, so 399 are not. Then the carriers would be 2pq*N, so 0.095*400 = 38. So 38 out of 400, which reduces to 19/200. So that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 19/200 or 0.095. Since the problem says \"proportion\", which is a number between 0 and 1, so either is okay, but maybe boxed as a fraction. Let me see, in textbooks, sometimes they prefer fractions for exactness. So I'll go with \\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{200}}.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me think of another way. Suppose the frequency of the recessive allele is q, so q squared is 1/400. So q is 1/20. Then the heterozygote frequency is 2*(1 - q)*q. So 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = 38/400 = 19/200. Yep, that's exactly the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to write it as 9.5%, but the question says proportion, so decimal. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 9.5/100, but that's 0.095. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of 1 in something? Like 1 in 5.26? But that's not a proportion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the beginning. Let me check the problem again. \n\n\"In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?\"\n\nSo the key points: recessive allele b causes cancer when homozygous. So the affected are bb. The frequency of bb is 1/400. So q\u00b2 = 1/400. So q = 1/20. Then carriers are Bb, which is 2pq. So 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = 19/200. \n\nTherefore, I think that's correct. So I think the answer is 19/200. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to write it as a decimal. Let me see. 19 divided by 200. 200 goes into 19 0.095 times. So 0.095. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as 0.095. Since in some cases, fractions can be tricky. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check if the question is about the allele frequency. Wait no, the question is about the proportion of individuals who are carriers, so genotype frequency. \n\nTherefore, I think I've confirmed it multiple times. The answer is 19/200 or 0.095. Since the problem says \"proportion\", which is a number between 0 and 1, so either is okay, but since they might prefer fractions, I'll go with 19/200. \n\nWait, but let me check if 19/200 is the correct fraction. 19 divided by 200 is 0.095, yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to present it as 95/1000, but that reduces to 19/200. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 9.5%, but the question says proportion, so 0.095. \n\nHmm. Since the user hasn't given options, but just wants the answer in boxed, I think either is okay, but perhaps the decimal is more straightforward. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of p. Since q is 1/20, so p is 19/20. So 2*(19/20)*(1/20) is indeed 38/400, which is 19/200. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the carriers might have a different penetrance? But the problem says \"completely recessive\", so I think penetrance is 100% for bb, and 0 for others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different notation where the dominant allele is b? Wait, no, because it says the cancer is caused by the recessive allele b, so the dominant allele would be B. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer is \\boxed{0.095}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that 1 out of every 400 people in a population has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele \\( b \\), we need to find the proportion of individuals who carry the \\( b \\) allele but are not expected to develop the cancer. The population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\n1. **Identify the frequency of the recessive allele (\\( q \\))**:\n   - The frequency of the recessive phenotype (homozygous recessive, \\( bb \\)) is given as \\( \\frac{1}{400} \\).\n   - Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation \\( q^2 = \\frac{1}{400} \\), we find \\( q \\):\n     \\[\n     q = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{400}} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the frequency of the dominant allele (\\( p \\))**:\n   - Using \\( p + q = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the frequency of heterozygotes (\\( 2pq \\))**:\n   - The proportion of carriers (heterozygotes \\( Bb \\)) is given by \\( 2pq \\):\n     \\[\n     2pq = 2 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.05 = 2 \\times 0.0475 = 0.095\n     \\]\n\nThus, the expected proportion of individuals who carry the \\( b \\) allele but are not expected to develop the cancer is \\(\\boxed{0.095}\\)."

The population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\n1. **Identify the frequency of the recessive allele (\\( q \\))**:\n   - The frequency of the recessive phenotype (homozygous recessive, \\( bb \\)) is given as \\( \\frac{1}{400} \\).\n   - Using the Hardy-Weinberg equation \\( q^2 = \\frac{1}{400} \\), we find \\( q \\):\n     \\[\n     q = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{400}} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the frequency of the dominant allele (\\( p \\))**:\n   - Using \\( p + q = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the frequency of heterozygotes (\\( 2pq \\))**:\n   - The proportion of carriers (heterozygotes \\( Bb \\)) is given by \\( 2pq \\):\n     \\[\n     2pq = 2 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.05 = 2 \\times 0.0475 = 0.095\n     \\]\n\nThus, the expected proportion of individuals who carry the \\( b \\) allele but are not expected to develop the cancer is \\(\\boxed{0.095}\\).",
