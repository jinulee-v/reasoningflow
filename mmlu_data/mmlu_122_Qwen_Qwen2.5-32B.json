        "response": "A federal deficit occurs when a government's expenditures exceed its revenues, typically over a fiscal year. This can happen for various reasons, such as increased spending on social programs, defense, or infrastructure, or a decrease in tax revenues due to economic downturns or tax cuts. The deficit is often financed by borrowing, which can lead to an increase in the national debt."
