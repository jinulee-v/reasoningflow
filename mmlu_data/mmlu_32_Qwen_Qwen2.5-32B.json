        "question": "Predict the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3\u2022), assuming the lines do not overlap.",
        "response": "The number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of 13C-labelled methyl radical (13CH3\u2022) can be predicted using the formula for the number of lines in a hyperfine splitting pattern, which is given by (n + 1), where n is the number of equivalent nuclei interacting with the unpaired electron. In this case, there are three equivalent hydrogen nuclei (1H) interacting with the unpaired electron in the 13C-labelled methyl radical. Therefore, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum would be (3 + 1) = 4."
