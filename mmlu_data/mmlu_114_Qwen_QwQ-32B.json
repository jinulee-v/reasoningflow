        "question": "Which one of the following items is an example of nonmaterial culture?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options is an example of nonmaterial culture. First, I should remember what nonmaterial culture means. From what I recall, culture has two main components: material and nonmaterial. Material culture refers to the physical objects or things that a society makes, like tools, clothing, buildings, and technology. Nonmaterial culture, on the other hand, includes the ideas, beliefs, practices, and social norms that shape a society. \n\nSo the question is asking for an example of nonmaterial culture. Let me think of the typical examples. Nonmaterial culture includes things like languages, religions, values, social norms, gestures, and traditions. For instance, the concept of marriage is nonmaterial, even though the wedding ceremony might involve material things like rings or a venue. Similarly, a language itself is nonmaterial, even though it's written down in books (which are material). \n\nNow, the user hasn't provided the options, but maybe I can think through common examples that might be in such a question. Let me consider possible options. Suppose the choices are something like:\n\nA) A smartphone\nB) A religious belief system\nC) A table\nD) A pair of shoes\n\nIn that case, the nonmaterial one would be B) A religious belief system. The others are physical objects. But since I don't have the actual options, I need to think of other possibilities. Maybe another example could be a holiday tradition, like celebrating Christmas or Diwali. Or perhaps a social norm like shaking hands when meeting someone. \n\nWait, maybe the question includes options like \"language\" versus \"clothing.\" Language is nonmaterial, clothing is material. Or maybe \"marriage\" versus \"wedding rings.\" Marriage is a social institution (nonmaterial), while the rings are material. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are more abstract. Let me try to structure this. Nonmaterial culture includes:\n\n1. **Beliefs and Values**: Religious, moral, or ethical beliefs.\n2. **Norms**: Social norms, folkways, mores.\n3. **Laws and Regulations**: Legal systems.\n4. **Language**: The system of communication, not the physical books.\n5. **Cultural Practices**: Rituals, ceremonies, traditions.\n6. **Symbols**: Like flags as symbols of nationality, but the flag itself is material; the symbolism is nonmaterial.\n\nSo if the options include something like \"the concept of democracy\" versus \"a voting machine,\" the former is nonmaterial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a standard test. Let me think of common textbook examples. For instance, in many textbooks, examples of nonmaterial culture include things like gestures (like a thumbs-up), languages, religions, and social norms. Material culture would be things like houses, cars, clothes, tools.\n\nIf the options given were, say:\n\nA) A smartphone\nB) The concept of democracy\nC) A statue\nD) A book\n\nThen B would be nonmaterial. The book as an object is material, but the ideas in the book could be nonmaterial. Wait, but the question is about the item itself. So if the item is the book (the physical object), it's material. The content inside might be nonmaterial, but the question is about the item. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are more like:\n\nA) A wedding ring\nB) The tradition of marriage\nC) A car\nD) A house\n\nThen B would be nonmaterial. \n\nSince I don't have the exact options, I need to think of the most common examples. Let me try to recall some standard questions. For example, a classic question might have options like:\n\n1. A bicycle\n2. A handshake\n3. A computer\n4. A pair of jeans\n\nIn that case, the handshake as a gesture is nonmaterial, while the others are physical objects. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are:\n\nA) A recipe\nB) A cooking pot\nC) A dining table\nD) A knife\n\nHere, the recipe is nonmaterial (it's a set of instructions), while the others are material. \n\nWait, but a recipe could be written down (material), but the actual instructions themselves are nonmaterial. Hmm, tricky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question includes something like \"the national anthem\" versus \"a flag.\" The anthem is a song (nonmaterial), the flag is material. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are:\n\nA) A smartphone\nB) The concept of time\nC) A car\nD) A house\n\nThen B is nonmaterial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a specific source. Since I can't see the options, I need to think of the most probable answer. The user is asking for an example of nonmaterial culture, so the answer should be an idea, practice, or belief rather than a physical object. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes people confuse symbols as nonmaterial, but symbols can have material representations. For instance, a flag is material, but the symbolism of the flag (like representing a country) is nonmaterial. \n\nWait, perhaps the question includes \"gestures\" as an option. For example, a thumbs-up gesture is nonmaterial, while a thumbs-up emoji on a phone is material. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are:\n\nA) A bicycle\nB) A religious ritual\nC) A book\nD) A bridge\n\nThen B is nonmaterial. \n\nGiven that I can't see the actual options, but the user is asking for an example, I can provide a general answer. The key is to identify which item is not a physical object but rather an idea, belief, practice, or norm. \n\nSo, if I had to give an example without the options, common nonmaterial culture examples include:\n\n- Language\n- Religion\n- Values (like honesty, freedom)\n- Social norms (like greetings, table manners)\n- Laws\n- Traditions (like holidays, weddings)\n- Folklore and myths\n- Artistic styles (though the art itself is material, the style is nonmaterial)\n- Symbols (the meaning behind them)\n\nTherefore, if one of the options is something like \"the tradition of celebrating birthdays\" or \"the concept of democracy,\" that would be nonmaterial. In contrast, a physical object like a birthday cake or a voting machine is material. \n\nSince the user hasn't provided the options, but the question is likely from a standard test, I can infer that common answers might be things like religious beliefs, social norms, languages, or traditions. \n\nWait, perhaps the options are:\n\nA) A smartphone\nB) A set of religious beliefs\nC) A table\nD) A pair of shoes\n\nThen B is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are:\n\n1. A car\n2. The concept of marriage\n3. A house\n4. A computer\n\nThen 2 is nonmaterial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question includes \"manners\" as an option. For example, table manners are nonmaterial norms. \n\nIn any case, the key is to pick the non-physical aspect. Since I can't see the options, but the user is asking for an example, I can state that nonmaterial culture examples include beliefs, values, norms, languages, traditions, etc., and contrast them with material items like tools, buildings, clothing. \n\nTherefore, if given a choice between a physical object and an abstract concept, the abstract one is nonmaterial. \n\nPerhaps the user expects me to list possible examples, but since they asked for \"which one of the following items,\" I need to think of a standard example. \n\nWait, maybe the question is from a common quiz where the options are:\n\nA) A smartphone\nB) A religious belief system\nC) A table\nD) A pair of shoes\n\nThen the answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, if the options are:\n\nA) A recipe\nB) A cooking pot\nC) A dining table\nD) A knife\n\nThen A is nonmaterial (the instructions), but the pot, table, knife are material. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are:\n\nA) A bicycle\nB) The concept of time\nC) A car\nD) A house\n\nThen B is nonmaterial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are:\n\nA) A wedding ring\nB) The tradition of marriage\nC) A car\nD) A house\n\nThen B is nonmaterial. \n\nGiven that, I think the most common example in such questions is something like a religious belief system, social norms, or a language. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question includes \"gestures\" as an option. For example, a thumbs-up gesture is nonmaterial, while a thumbs-up emoji is material. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are:\n\nA) A smartphone\nB) The concept of democracy\nC) A statue\nD) A book\n\nThen B is nonmaterial. \n\nSince I can't be sure, but the user is asking for an example, I can state that nonmaterial culture includes things like religious beliefs, social norms, languages, traditions, values, and the correct answer would be whichever of the options fits into these categories. \n\nTherefore, if I have to pick one common example, perhaps \"religious beliefs\" or \"social norms\" are typical answers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a specific source where the options are:\n\nA) A bicycle\nB) A handshake\nC) A computer\nD) A house\n\nThen B is nonmaterial (a gesture). \n\nAlternatively, \"a language\" versus \"a book.\" \n\nIn conclusion, without the exact options, the best approach is to explain that nonmaterial culture includes abstract concepts, beliefs, practices, and norms, so the correct answer is whichever option represents such an abstract concept rather than a physical object.\n</think>\n\nAn example of **nonmaterial culture** is **a religious belief system**. Nonmaterial culture refers to the abstract ideas, values, norms, and practices that shape a society, rather than physical objects. Here's a breakdown:\n\n### Key Characteristics of Nonmaterial Culture:\n1. **Beliefs and Values**: Religious doctrines, moral principles, or ethical frameworks (e.g., \"the concept of democracy\" or \"honesty as a virtue\").\n2. **Social Norms and Traditions**: Practices like greetings, rituals, or customs (e.g., shaking hands, celebrating holidays).\n3. **Language**: The system of communication itself (not the physical books or devices used to record it).\n4. **Symbols and Meanings**: The significance behind flags, gestures, or art (e.g., a flag representing patriotism).\n\n### Example Scenario (Hypothetical Options):\nIf the question provided options like:\n- A) A smartphone  \n- B) A religious belief system  \n- C) A table  \n- D) A pair of shoes  \n\n**Answer**: **B) A religious belief system** is nonmaterial, while the others are physical objects (material culture).\n\n### Why Other Options Are Material:\n- **Smartphone, table, shoes**: These are tangible items.  \n- **Religious beliefs**: These are abstract ideas, practices, and values that exist in the collective consciousness of a group.\n\nNonmaterial culture is intangible but profoundly influences how societies function and interact."
