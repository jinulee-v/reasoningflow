        "question": "Psychological egoism is:",
        "response": "Psychological egoism is a theory in philosophy and psychology that posits that all human actions are motivated by self-interest, even when they appear to be altruistic. According to this view, individuals always act in ways that they believe will benefit themselves, whether directly or indirectly. This theory suggests that behaviors such as helping others, charity, or self-sacrifice are ultimately driven by the desire for personal satisfaction, approval, or some other form of self-benefit.\n\nPsychological egoism is a descriptive theory, meaning it aims to describe how people actually behave, rather than prescribing how they should behave (which would be a normative theory). It is often contrasted with ethical egoism, which is a normative theory advocating that individuals ought to act in their own self-interest.\n\nCritics of psychological egoism argue that it is difficult to empirically prove that all actions are self-interested, and that it may overlook genuine altruistic motivations. Additionally, some philosophers contend that the theory is unfalsifiable, as it can reinterpret any seemingly altruistic act as being self-serving in some way."
