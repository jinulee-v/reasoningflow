        "question": "Traditionally, when we have a real-valued input attribute during decision-tree learning we consider a binary split according to whether the attribute is above or below some threshold. Pat suggests that instead we should just have a multiway split with one branch for each of the distinct values of the attribute. From the list below choose the single biggest problem with Pat\u2019s suggestion:",
        "response": "The biggest problem with Pat's suggestion is that it can lead to overfitting. When you have a multiway split with one branch for each distinct value of the attribute, the decision tree can become too complex and fit the training data too closely, including its noise and outliers. This can result in poor generalization to new, unseen data. Additionally, if the attribute has many distinct values, the tree can become very large and computationally expensive to build and use."
