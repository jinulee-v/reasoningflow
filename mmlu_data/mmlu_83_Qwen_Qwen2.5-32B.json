        "question": " Construct a complete truth table for the following pairs of propositions. Then, using the truth tables, determine whether the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory. If neither, determine whether they are consistent or inconsistent. Justify your answers.\nE \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) and ~E \u00b7 F",
        "response": "To construct the truth table for the given propositions, we need to evaluate the truth values of each proposition for all possible combinations of truth values for the variables E and F. Here are the truth tables for the given propositions:\n\n| E | F | E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) | ~E \u00b7 F |\n|---|---|-------------|--------|\n| T | T | T           | F      |\n| T | F | F           | F      |\n| F | T | T           | T      |\n| F | F | T           | F      |\n\nNow, let's analyze the truth tables to determine the logical relationship between the propositions:\n\n1. Logically equivalent: Two propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth values for all possible combinations of truth values for the variables. In this case, the truth values for E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) and ~E \u00b7 F are not the same for all combinations, so they are not logically equivalent.\n\n2. Contradictory: Two propositions are contradictory if they have opposite truth values for all possible combinations of truth values for the variables. In this case, the truth values for E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) and ~E \u00b7 F are not opposite for all combinations, so they are not contradictory.\n\n3. Consistent: Two propositions are consistent if there is at least one combination of truth values for the variables where both propositions are true. In this case, there is no combination where both E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) and ~E \u00b7 F are true, so they are not consistent.\n\n4. Inconsistent: Two propositions are inconsistent if there is no combination of truth values for the variables where both propositions are true. In this case, there is no combination where both E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) and ~E \u00b7 F are true, so they are inconsistent.\n\nIn conclusion, the propositions E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) and ~E \u00b7 F are inconsistent."
