        "response": "The pressure-flow model, also known as the mass flow hypothesis, explains how phloem sap moves from sources (like leaves) to sinks (like roots or fruits). This movement is driven by the difference in osmotic pressure between the source and sink. At the source, sugars produced during photosynthesis are loaded into the phloem, increasing the osmotic pressure and drawing water into the phloem through osmosis. This creates a high pressure in the phloem at the source. As the phloem sap moves towards the sink, sugars are unloaded and used by the sink tissues, decreasing the osmotic pressure. Water then moves out of the phloem at the sink, creating a low pressure. The pressure gradient between the source and sink drives the movement of phloem sap from the source to the sink."
