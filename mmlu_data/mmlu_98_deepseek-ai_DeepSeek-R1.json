        "question": "A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the pKa of this monoprotic acid. Let me start by recalling what I know. The acid is monoprotic, which means it donates one proton per molecule. The molar mass is 248 g/mol, but I don't think I need that right away. The problem says that 0.0050 mol of the acid is dissolved in 0.500 L of water, resulting in a pH of 3.89. \n\nFirst, maybe I should find the concentration of the acid solution. Since concentration is moles per liter, I can divide the moles by the volume. So 0.0050 mol divided by 0.500 L. Let me calculate that: 0.0050 / 0.500 = 0.010 M. So the initial concentration of the acid, which I'll call HA, is 0.010 M.\n\nThe pH is 3.89, which means the concentration of H+ ions is 10^(-3.89). Let me compute that. Taking 10 to the power of -3.89. Hmm, 10^-3 is 0.001, and 10^-0.89 is approximately 0.128. So multiplying those together: 0.001 * 0.128 = 0.000128. So [H+] \u2248 1.28 x 10^-4 M. \n\nSince HA is a weak acid, it dissociates as HA \u21cc H+ + A-. The concentration of H+ ions should be equal to the concentration of A- ions, assuming that the autoionization of water is negligible. So [H+] = [A-] = 1.28 x 10^-4 M. \n\nThe initial concentration of HA was 0.010 M, and some of it dissociates. The change in concentration would be -x, where x is [H+]. So the equilibrium concentration of HA is 0.010 - x. Since x is 1.28 x 10^-4, let's subtract that from 0.010. 0.010 - 0.000128 \u2248 0.009872 M. \n\nNow, the expression for Ka is [H+][A-]/[HA]. Plugging in the values: (1.28 x 10^-4)^2 / 0.009872. Let me compute the numerator first: (1.28 x 10^-4)^2 = (1.28)^2 x 10^-8 = 1.6384 x 10^-8. Then divide by 0.009872: 1.6384 x 10^-8 / 0.009872 \u2248 1.66 x 10^-6. \n\nSo Ka \u2248 1.66 x 10^-6. Then pKa is the negative logarithm of Ka. So pKa = -log(1.66 x 10^-6). Let me compute that. log(1.66) is approximately 0.22, so log(1.66 x 10^-6) = 0.22 - 6 = -5.78. Therefore, pKa \u2248 5.78. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Wait, log(1.66) is actually log(1.66). Let me use a calculator. Log(1.66) is approximately 0.2200. So yes, log(1.66 x 10^-6) = log(1.66) + log(10^-6) = 0.2200 - 6 = -5.78. Therefore, pKa = 5.78. \n\nBut wait, let me verify if my assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.010 is valid. The initial concentration was 0.010 M, and x is 0.000128 M. So 0.000128 / 0.010 = 0.0128, which is about 1.28%. Since this is less than 5%, the assumption is valid, and the approximation holds. So the error introduced by neglecting x in the denominator is minimal. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be more precise, I could use the exact expression without approximation. Let's try that. \n\nThe exact expression for Ka is (x^2)/(0.010 - x). We know x is 1.28 x 10^-4. Plugging that into the denominator: 0.010 - 1.28 x 10^-4 = 0.009872, which is what I used before. So even if I do it exactly, the value is the same. Therefore, the approximation is okay here. \n\nSo, the Ka is approximately 1.66 x 10^-6, and the pKa is approximately 5.78. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the pH calculation correctly. The pH is 3.89, so [H+] = 10^-3.89. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator: 10^(-3.89). Let's break it down. 10^(-3) is 0.001. Then, 10^(-0.89). Let's compute 10^(-0.89). \n\nLogarithmically, since 10^0.89 = 10^(0.8 + 0.09) = 10^0.8 * 10^0.09. \n\n10^0.8 is approximately 6.3096, and 10^0.09 is approximately 1.23. So multiplying those: 6.3096 * 1.23 \u2248 7.76. Therefore, 10^0.89 \u2248 7.76, so 10^-0.89 \u2248 1/7.76 \u2248 0.1289. \n\nTherefore, 10^-3.89 = 10^-3 * 10^-0.89 \u2248 0.001 * 0.1289 \u2248 0.0001289. So [H+] \u2248 1.289 x 10^-4 M. \n\nSo squaring that gives (1.289 x 10^-4)^2 \u2248 1.66 x 10^-8. Then dividing by 0.009872 gives 1.66 x 10^-8 / 0.009872 \u2248 1.68 x 10^-6. So Ka \u2248 1.68 x 10^-6. Then pKa = -log(1.68 x 10^-6) \u2248 5.775. \n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 5.78. \n\nAlternatively, using more precise calculation for log(1.68 x 10^-6). \n\nSince log(1.68) is log(1.6) + log(1.05). Wait, 1.68 is 1.6 * 1.05. Wait, no. Alternatively, log(1.68) can be calculated as follows: \n\nlog(1.68) = log(1 + 0.68) but that's not helpful. Alternatively, remember that log(1.6) \u2248 0.2041, log(1.7) \u2248 0.2304. Since 1.68 is between 1.6 and 1.7. \n\nUsing linear approximation: between 1.6 (0.2041) and 1.7 (0.2304). The difference is 0.0263 over 0.1. So per 0.01 increase, it's 0.00263 per 0.01. \n\n1.68 is 0.08 above 1.6. So 0.08 * 0.0263 / 0.1 = 0.08 * 0.263 = 0.0210. So log(1.68) \u2248 0.2041 + 0.0210 \u2248 0.2251. \n\nTherefore, log(1.68 x 10^-6) = 0.2251 - 6 = -5.7749. So pKa = 5.7749, which rounds to 5.77 or 5.78. Depending on the significant figures. \n\nThe given data has two significant figures in the moles (0.0050 mol) which is two sig figs, volume is 0.500 L which is three sig figs. The pH is 3.89, which is three sig figs. So the limiting factor is the moles, which is two sig figs. Wait, but 0.0050 has two sig figs, right? The two zeros after the decimal are significant because they come after the 5. So 0.0050 is two sig figs. The volume is 0.500 L, which is three sig figs. So when calculating concentration, moles divided by volume: 0.0050 / 0.500 = 0.010 M, which is two sig figs. \n\nThen pH is given as 3.89, which is three sig figs. So when calculating [H+], that would be three sig figs. So [H+] = 1.29 x 10^-4 (three sig figs). Then Ka is (1.29 x 10^-4)^2 / (0.010 - 0.000129) \u2248 (1.66 x 10^-8) / 0.00987 \u2248 1.68 x 10^-6. So Ka is approximately 1.68 x 10^-6, which is three sig figs. Then pKa is -log(1.68 x 10^-6) \u2248 5.775, which rounds to 5.78 (three decimal places, but since Ka has three sig figs, pKa would be reported to two decimal places, so 5.78). \n\nTherefore, the pKa of the acid is approximately 5.78. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"a new compound is synthesized... molar mass of 248 g/mol.\" But we didn't use the molar mass here. Maybe that's extra information? Or did I miss something? The problem gives molar mass but since we are given moles directly, maybe we don't need molar mass. So probably, the molar mass is just extra info, perhaps to check if someone tries to calculate concentration using mass instead of moles. But since moles are given, we don't need molar mass. \n\nSo, conclusion: pKa is approximately 5.78. \n\nBut let me check with another approach. Let's use the formula for weak acids: \n\nFor a weak acid HA dissociating into H+ and A-, the pH can be approximated by pH = 1/2 (pKa - log c), where c is the concentration. Wait, is that correct? \n\nWait, the formula is pH = 1/2 (pKa - log c) when the dissociation is small. Let me recall. \n\nThe exact expression is Ka = [H+]^2 / (c - [H+]). If [H+] << c, then Ka \u2248 [H+]^2 / c, so [H+] \u2248 sqrt(Ka * c), so pH = 1/2 (pKa - log c). \n\nBut here, we can rearrange this to solve for pKa. \n\nGiven pH, we can find [H+] = 10^-pH. Then, if we assume [H+] \u2248 sqrt(Ka * c), then Ka \u2248 [H+]^2 / c, so pKa = -log(Ka) = -log([H+]^2 / c) = -2 log[H+] + log c = 2 pH + log c. \n\nWait, let's check that:\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / c\n\nTake log:\n\nlog Ka = 2 log [H+] - log c\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\npKa = -2 log [H+] + log c = 2 pH + log c\n\nYes, that's correct. So pKa = 2 pH + log c. \n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nGiven pH = -log[H+], so -log[H+] = pH, so log[H+] = -pH. Then:\n\nlog Ka = 2 log[H+] - log c = 2*(-pH) - log c = -2 pH - log c\n\nTherefore, pKa = -log Ka = 2 pH + log c\n\nSo pKa = 2 pH + log c\n\nWait, that's a useful formula. Let me apply that here. \n\nGiven pH = 3.89, c = 0.010 M (since 0.0050 mol / 0.500 L = 0.010 M). \n\nSo log c = log(0.010) = -2. \n\nTherefore, pKa = 2*3.89 + (-2) = 7.78 - 2 = 5.78. \n\nSo that's the same result as before. So this confirms that pKa is 5.78. \n\nThis method is quicker. So using the formula pKa = 2 pH + log c, where c is the concentration of the acid. \n\nBut this formula assumes that [H+] is much less than c, which we checked earlier (about 1.28% dissociation), so the approximation holds. \n\nTherefore, the answer is pKa = 5.78. \n\nI think that's solid. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the pKa is 5.78. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe pKa of the acid is \\boxed{5.78}."
