        "correct_answer": "If a party to a contentious case before the ICJ does not have a national sitting as judge, it is entitled to nominate someone as a judge solely for that case, with the title of judge ad hoc"
    },
    "raw_text": {
        "question": "What is the judge ad hoc?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what a \"judge ad hoc\" is. Let me start by breaking down the term. \"Ad hoc\" is a Latin phrase that means \"for this purpose\" or \"created or done for a particular purpose as necessary.\" So, putting that together with \"judge,\" it probably refers to a judge appointed for a specific case or purpose.\n\nI remember that in some international courts, like the International Court of Justice (ICJ), each country involved in a case usually has a judge from their own nationality on the bench. But if a country doesn't have a judge of their nationality already sitting on the court, they might appoint a judge ad hoc. That way, both parties in the dispute have representation. \n\nWait, but I should verify that. Let me think. The ICJ has 15 judges elected for nine-year terms. They come from different countries, but not every country is represented. So, if a country is party to a case and doesn't have a judge on the court, they can choose a judge ad hoc. This ensures that both sides have someone who can present their legal perspectives. \n\nBut how does that work exactly? The judge ad hoc would participate in the deliberations and the decision-making process, right? They have the same rights as the other judges during the case. However, they might not be part of the court permanently. Once the case is over, their role ends. \n\nAre there other courts or legal systems that use judges ad hoc? Maybe in some domestic contexts, but I think it's more common in international law. For example, the Permanent Court of Arbitration might have similar provisions. Also, in some specialized tribunals, like those dealing with maritime disputes or trade issues, ad hoc judges could be appointed. \n\nI should check if there are any specific rules governing the appointment of judges ad hoc. The ICJ Statute, which is part of the UN Charter, probably outlines this. Article 31 of the ICJ Statute allows for judges ad hoc. Each party can choose one, or if there are multiple parties on the same side, they might have to agree on one. The judge ad hoc must meet the same qualifications as the regular judges. \n\nBut what's the rationale behind this? It's to ensure fairness and the appearance of impartiality. Even though the ICJ judges are supposed to be impartial, having a judge from each party's country can help balance perspectives. However, if a country doesn't have a judge, the ad hoc system allows them to still have representation. \n\nAre there any criticisms of this system? Some might argue that it could lead to bias, but the ad hoc judges are supposed to uphold judicial independence. Also, their vote is just one among many, so maybe the impact is limited. \n\nAnother point: in domestic legal systems, sometimes temporary judges are appointed for specific cases, especially if there's a conflict of interest or a need for specialized knowledge. But those might not be called \"ad hoc\" judges. The term seems more entrenched in international law. \n\nSo, summarizing, a judge ad hoc is a temporary judge appointed by a party to an international case when that party doesn't have a judge of its nationality on the bench. They serve only for that particular case, ensuring representation and contributing their legal expertise to the proceedings. The practice is codified in the ICJ Statute and aims to maintain fairness in international disputes."
