        "response": "As of 2020, recent research on hominid species dating from the Middle Pliocene indicates that there was a greater diversity of hominid species than previously thought. This includes the discovery of new species such as Australopithecus deyiremeda and Australopithecus sediba, which have expanded our understanding of the evolutionary tree of early human ancestors. These findings suggest that multiple hominid species coexisted during this period, challenging the earlier notion of a linear progression from one species to another."
