        "question": "In animal cells, which of the following represents the most likely pathway that a secretory protein takes as it is synthesized in a cell?",
        "response": "The most likely pathway for a secretory protein in animal cells is as follows:\n\n1. The protein synthesis begins in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes translate the mRNA into a polypeptide chain.\n2. The signal sequence at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), which halts the translation process.\n3. The SRP-ribosome complex is then guided to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) by the SRP receptor on the RER membrane.\n4. The polypeptide chain is translocated into the lumen of the RER through a protein-conducting channel.\n5. The signal sequence is cleaved off by a signal peptidase enzyme, and the protein undergoes folding and modification in the RER lumen.\n6. The folded protein is packaged into transport vesicles that bud off from the RER membrane.\n7. The transport vesicles fuse with the cis-Golgi network, where the protein undergoes further modification and sorting.\n8. The protein is packaged into secretory vesicles that bud off from the trans-Golgi network.\n9. The secretory vesicles move towards the plasma membrane and fuse with it, releasing the protein outside the cell through exocytosis."
