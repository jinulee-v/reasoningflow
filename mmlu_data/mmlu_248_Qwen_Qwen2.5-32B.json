        "question": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
        "response": "The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a viral upper respiratory infection, commonly known as the common cold. The symptoms described, such as sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache, are typical of a viral infection. The absence of shortness of breath and the clear lungs on auscultation also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and lack of significant medical history further suggest a viral etiology."
