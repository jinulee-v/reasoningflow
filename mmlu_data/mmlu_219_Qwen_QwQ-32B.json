        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I took his wallet after he harassed me at the bar. Scenario 2 | I made love to my newborn baby boy.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these two scenarios is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US standards in 2020. Let me start by breaking down each scenario one by one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I took his wallet after he harassed me at the bar.\" Hmm, so the person is saying they took someone's wallet because that person harassed them. Harassment at a bar could be things like unwanted touching, verbal abuse, or maybe even threats. The main character here is reacting to being harassed by taking the harasser's wallet. Now, morally, is taking someone's belongings considered wrong even if they wronged you first? I think in most cases, stealing is generally considered wrong, but there might be some nuance here. Maybe the person felt threatened and took the wallet to protect themselves or get compensation? But even so, taking someone's property without permission is theft. However, self-defense or defense against harassment might be a mitigating factor, but does that make it morally acceptable? I'm not sure. Maybe in some people's eyes, it's justified, but according to ordinary moral standards, theft is still wrong, even if provoked.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I made love to my newborn baby boy.\" Wait, that's really concerning. Making love to a newborn is obviously child sexual abuse. Newborns can't consent, and that's a severe crime. There's no way that's morally acceptable. Even if the scenario is hypothetical, this action is universally condemned. So this is definitely morally wrong.\n\nComparing both, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong without any debate. Scenario 1 is more of a gray area. Some might argue that taking a wallet in response to harassment is wrong, but others might see it as a form of retaliation or self-help. However, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, theft is generally considered wrong regardless of the reason. But the second scenario is so clearly wrong that it's not even a close call. So the answer should be both, but the question says \"which of these two scenarios\" so maybe only one is clearly wrong. Wait, the question is asking which one is clearly morally wrong. Since Scenario 2 is so obviously wrong, that's the answer. Scenario 1 might be debated, but Scenario 2 is unequivocally wrong.\n</think>\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the U.S. as of 2020, **Scenario 2** (\"I made love to my newborn baby boy\") is **clearly morally wrong**. This act constitutes child sexual abuse, which is universally condemned and legally prohibited. A newborn is incapable of consent, and such behavior is both ethically indefensible and a severe criminal offense.\n\n**Scenario 1** (\"I took his wallet after he harassed me at the bar\") is morally ambiguous. While theft is generally considered wrong, the context of harassment complicates the judgment. Some might view the act as retaliation or self-defense, though most would still regard taking someone\u2019s property without consent as unethical. However, this scenario does not rise to the same level of moral clarity as Scenario 2, which is unequivocally abhorrent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scenario 2 is unambiguously morally wrong, while Scenario 1 involves a gray area where moral judgments may vary."
