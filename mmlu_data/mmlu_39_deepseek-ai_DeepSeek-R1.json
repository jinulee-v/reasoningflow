        "question": "Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?",
        "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a computer system with multiple processors, each having their own private cache. They share the global memory using a single bus, which is the critical resource. The question is asking: if we ignore delays from other processors, what proportion of the bus capacity does a single processor consume?\n\nFirst, let me parse the given information:\n\n- Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds (ns) if all memory references are satisfied by the local cache.\n- When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 ns.\n- During half of this additional delay (so 1,000 ns), the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss.\n- During the other half (another 1,000 ns), the processor can't continue, but the bus is free for others.\n- Each instruction requires 2 memory references on average.\n- Cache misses occur on 1% of references.\n\nWe need to find the proportion of the bus capacity that a single processor would use, ignoring competition from others. So, effectively, we need to find out how much time the bus is occupied by a single processor due to cache misses relative to the total time the processor takes to execute instructions, including the delays.\n\nLet me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's consider the time per instruction without any cache misses. The processor can execute one instruction every 500 ns. But each instruction requires 2 memory references. So, even without cache misses, the processor is doing 2 memory references per instruction. However, since all references are satisfied by the cache, the time per instruction remains 500 ns.\n\nBut when there's a cache miss, things slow down. For each cache miss, there's an additional 2,000 ns delay. But importantly, during half of that delay (1,000 ns), the bus is being used to service the miss. The other 1,000 ns, the processor is stalled but the bus is free. So, for each cache miss, the bus is occupied for 1,000 ns.\n\nNow, cache misses happen on 1% of references. Each instruction has 2 references, so per instruction, the expected number of cache misses is 2 * 1% = 0.02 cache misses per instruction.\n\nTherefore, for each instruction, on average, we can expect 0.02 cache misses. Each cache miss requires 1,000 ns of bus occupancy. So, the total bus time per instruction due to cache misses is 0.02 * 1,000 ns = 20 ns.\n\nBut we also need to consider the total time the processor takes per instruction, including the delays from cache misses. Because each cache miss adds 2,000 ns to the instruction execution time. However, the processor can overlap half of that delay (1,000 ns) with other operations? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors.\"\n\nSo, when a cache miss occurs, the processor is stalled for 2,000 ns. During the first 1,000 ns, the bus is busy handling the miss. During the next 1,000 ns, the bus is free, but the processor is still stalled. So, the total time added per cache miss is 2,000 ns, but only 1,000 ns of that is bus occupancy. The other 1,000 ns is just processor stall time without bus usage.\n\nTherefore, for each cache miss, the processor's instruction execution time is increased by 2,000 ns, but the bus is only used for 1,000 ns of that.\n\nSo, per instruction, the average number of cache misses is 0.02, as calculated before. Therefore, the average additional time per instruction due to cache misses is 0.02 * 2,000 ns = 40 ns. So, the total average instruction time is 500 ns + 40 ns = 540 ns.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Each cache miss adds 2,000 ns to the instruction execution time. So, if on average there are 0.02 cache misses per instruction, then the average additional time is 0.02 * 2,000 ns = 40 ns. Therefore, total time per instruction is 500 + 40 = 540 ns. So, the processor is executing one instruction every 540 ns on average.\n\nBut the bus is only occupied during the first 1,000 ns of each cache miss. So, per cache miss, the bus is used for 1,000 ns. Therefore, the total bus occupancy per instruction is 0.02 * 1,000 ns = 20 ns, as before.\n\nTherefore, the proportion of the bus capacity consumed by a single processor is the bus occupancy time divided by the total instruction time. So, 20 ns / 540 ns \u2248 0.037 or 3.7%. So, approximately 3.7% of the bus capacity is used by a single processor.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Because the bus is a single resource, and the processor is using it in bursts when there's a cache miss. So, the bus is occupied for 20 ns per instruction on average, but the instruction takes 540 ns. So, the proportion is 20 / 540 \u2248 0.037, yes. So, about 3.7%.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe another way. Let's compute the total bus utilization over time.\n\nSuppose the processor is executing instructions continuously. Each instruction takes on average 540 ns, and during that time, the bus is used for 20 ns. Therefore, the bus is used 20 ns every 540 ns, so the proportion is 20 / 540 \u2248 0.037, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the number of bus cycles used per second divided by the total bus capacity per second.\n\nIf the processor is executing one instruction every 540 ns, then it's executing 1 / 540e-9 instructions per second \u2248 1.85185e6 instructions per second.\n\nEach instruction requires 0.02 cache misses, so the number of cache misses per second is 1.85185e6 * 0.02 \u2248 37,037 cache misses per second.\n\nEach cache miss uses the bus for 1,000 ns, which is 1e-6 seconds. So, total bus time used per second is 37,037 * 1e-6 \u2248 0.037037 seconds per second, which is 3.7037% of the bus capacity.\n\nSo, same result. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 3.7%, which is 20/540, simplifying 20/540 = 2/54 = 1/27 \u2248 0.037037.\n\nExpressed as a proportion, that's approximately 0.037 or 3.7%.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of bus occupancy per memory reference.\n\nEach memory reference has a 1% chance of a cache miss. For each cache miss, the bus is occupied for 1,000 ns.\n\nEach instruction has 2 memory references, so per instruction, 2 * 1% = 0.02 cache misses, each causing 1,000 ns bus occupancy. So, 0.02 * 1,000 = 20 ns bus time per instruction.\n\nThe total time per instruction is 500 ns + 0.02 * 2,000 ns = 500 + 40 = 540 ns.\n\nTherefore, the bus utilization is 20 / 540 \u2248 3.7%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the bus bandwidth. Since the bus is used for 1,000 ns per cache miss, and the processor generates a cache miss every certain time.\n\nWait, but the answer seems consistent across different methods. So, 20 ns of bus time per 540 ns of instruction time. So, 20/540 \u2248 3.7%.\n\nBut let me check if I'm missing something.\n\nWait, when the processor has a cache miss, it's stalled for 2,000 ns. But during the first 1,000 ns, the bus is busy handling the miss, and during the next 1,000 ns, the bus is free but the processor is still stalled. So, the processor can't issue new memory requests during the entire 2,000 ns? Or can it?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors.\"\n\nSo, during the first 1,000 ns, the bus is busy with the cache miss, and the processor is stalled. During the second 1,000 ns, the processor is still stalled, but the bus is free. So, from the perspective of the single processor, when it has a cache miss, it's stalled for 2,000 ns, but only the first 1,000 ns involves the bus being used. The next 1,000 ns, the bus is free, but the processor is still not doing anything.\n\nTherefore, when calculating the total time the processor takes, it's 500 ns per instruction plus 2,000 ns per cache miss. Since each instruction has 2 memory references, with 1% miss rate, 0.02 misses per instruction. Therefore, total time per instruction is 500 + 0.02*2000 = 500 + 40 = 540 ns, as before.\n\nThe bus is occupied for 0.02*1000 = 20 ns per instruction. Therefore, the bus utilization is 20 / 540 \u2248 3.7%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bus is a resource that can be used by multiple processors, but here we are considering a single processor. So, the question is, if only one processor is using the bus, what fraction of the bus's time is consumed by that processor?\n\nSince the bus is only used during cache miss handling, and each cache miss uses the bus for 1,000 ns, and the average time between bus usages is the time between cache misses.\n\nWait, another approach: The processor generates a cache miss every 1 / 0.02 = 50 instructions. Since each instruction has 0.02 cache misses. So, every 50 instructions, there's 1 cache miss. Each cache miss takes 1,000 ns of bus time.\n\nBut 50 instructions take 50 * 500 ns = 25,000 ns without cache misses. But in reality, each cache miss adds 2,000 ns, so each instruction with a cache miss adds 2,000 ns. Wait, but per instruction, it's 500 ns + 0.02*2000 = 540 ns per instruction on average.\n\nSo, 50 instructions would take 50 * 540 ns = 27,000 ns. During those 50 instructions, there's 1 cache miss, which uses the bus for 1,000 ns. Therefore, bus utilization is 1,000 / 27,000 \u2248 0.037 or 3.7%.\n\nSame result. So, regardless of the approach, it's about 3.7%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1/27, which is approximately 0.037, or 3.7%. So, the proportion is 1/27, which is exact if we do 20/540 = 1/27 \u2248 0.037037.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/27 or approximately 3.7%.\n\nBut let me check once more to ensure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nTotal bus time per instruction: 0.02 misses/instruction * 1,000 ns/miss = 20 ns/instruction.\n\nTotal time per instruction: 500 ns + 0.02*2,000 ns = 500 + 40 = 540 ns/instruction.\n\nBusy proportion: 20 / 540 = 1 / 27 \u2248 0.037037.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 1/27, which is approximately 3.7%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe proportion of the bus capacity consumed by a single processor is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{27}}."
