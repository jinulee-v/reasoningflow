Symbols are the visual and tangible representations of an organization's culture, such as logos, uniforms, and other visual elements that convey the organization's identity and values. Regalia, which refers to the ceremonial attire and insignia worn by individuals in positions of authority or during special events, is a part of the symbols element in the cultural web."
