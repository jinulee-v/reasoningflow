        "question": "What is the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus. Let me start by recalling what I know about Homo erectus. They are an extinct species of hominid that lived from about 1.9 million years ago to possibly as recent as 108,000 years ago. They are considered one of the earliest humans to have body proportions similar to modern humans.\n\nCranial capacity refers to the volume of the braincase, which is an indicator of brain size. I remember that in human evolution, cranial capacity has generally increased over time. For example, Australopithecus species had smaller brains, maybe around 400-500 cc. Then Homo habilis, which is earlier than Homo erectus, had a cranial capacity of about 600-700 cc. So Homo erectus should be larger than that.\n\nBut wait, I need to be precise here. Let me think. I think Homo erectus had a range of cranial capacities. I remember reading that there's variation between different specimens and also between different geographic populations. For instance, some Asian Homo erectus specimens like Java Man and Peking Man might have different sizes compared to African ones like Turkana Boy.\n\nTurkana Boy, a well-known Homo erectus (or sometimes classified as Homo ergaster) specimen, had a cranial capacity of around 900 cc. But that's just one individual. The mean would be an average of multiple specimens. So maybe the range is from about 600 cc up to 1100 cc? But the average would be somewhere in the middle.\n\nWait, I think the commonly cited average is around 900-1000 cc. But I should check if that's accurate. Let me recall some numbers. For example, the Dmanisi hominins, which are sometimes considered Homo erectus or a related species, have smaller cranial capacities, around 600-775 cc. But those are early specimens from Georgia. Then the later ones like Peking Man averaged around 1000 cc. So maybe the overall average is between 800-1000 cc?\n\nBut sources might differ. Some textbooks say that Homo erectus had a mean cranial capacity of approximately 900 cc. However, there's a lot of variation. For example, some of the earliest African Homo erectus specimens might be around 800 cc, while later ones in Asia could be higher. So when calculating the mean, it's an average across all known specimens. If there are more later specimens with higher capacities, the mean might be closer to 900-1000 cc. But if there's a mix, maybe around 850-950 cc.\n\nI should also consider that sexual dimorphism might play a role. Males might have larger cranial capacities than females. So if the specimens found are a mix of males and females, the average would be somewhere in between. For example, if males average around 1000 cc and females around 800 cc, the mean would be around 900 cc.\n\nAnother point is that some sources might split Homo erectus into different species. For example, Homo ergaster in Africa is sometimes separated from Asian Homo erectus. If that's the case, maybe Homo ergaster has a slightly different average. But since the question is about Homo erectus broadly, including all geographic varieties, the mean would encompass all those.\n\nLooking up some references in my mind, I recall that the general consensus is that Homo erectus had a cranial capacity ranging from about 550 cc to 1250 cc, but the average is around 900-1000 cc. However, some sources might say the mean is approximately 950 cc. Wait, but I need to be careful here. The lower end around 550 cc might be disputed because that's quite small, more in line with Homo habilis. Maybe the actual range starts higher, like 700 cc to 1200 cc. For example, the earliest Homo erectus fossils from Dmanisi are around 600-775 cc, but some argue they might be a different species.\n\nSo, considering all this, the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus is often cited as between 850 and 1000 cubic centimeters (cc), with an average around 900-950 cc. However, different sources might give slightly different numbers based on the specimens included in the analysis. The key is that it's a significant increase from earlier Homo species but still less than the average for modern humans, which is about 1350 cc."
