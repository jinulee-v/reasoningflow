        "question": "Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y. Let me start by recalling what I know about expected values and variances for sums of random variables. \n\nFirst, the expected value part. I remember that the expected value of the sum of two random variables is just the sum of their individual expected values. So, E(X + Y) should be E(X) + E(Y). Let me check if that makes sense. If you have two variables, say X and Y, each with their own averages, then when you add them together, the average of the sum should be the sum of the averages. Yeah, that seems right. So in this case, E(X) is 37 and E(Y) is 62. Adding those together gives 37 + 62 = 99. So the expected value of X + Y is 99. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the variance part. Hmm, variances aren't as straightforward as expected values when you add variables. I remember that variance has something to do with how the variables relate to each other. Specifically, the variance of the sum of two random variables is the sum of their variances plus twice the covariance between them. The formula is Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2*Cov(X, Y). But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about the covariance or correlation between X and Y. Does that mean they are independent? Because if they are independent, then the covariance is zero, and the variance of the sum is just the sum of the variances. \n\nBut the problem statement doesn't say anything about independence. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe in the absence of information about covariance, we can't compute the variance? But the question is asking for the variance of X + Y. Maybe there's an assumption here that X and Y are independent? Because otherwise, we can't determine the variance without knowing the covariance. \n\nLet me check the problem statement again. It says: \"Suppose X and Y are random variables with E(X) = 37, var(X) = 5, E(Y) = 62, and var(Y) = 12. What are the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y?\" There's no mention of independence or covariance. Hmm. \n\nIn many basic probability problems, unless stated otherwise, sometimes they assume independence when asking about variance of sums. But I don't think that's a safe assumption unless specified. Wait, but maybe in this case, since they are asking for the variance, and not giving covariance, perhaps we are supposed to assume independence? Or maybe they expect the answer to include the covariance term? But since covariance isn't given, that can't be. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is from a section or textbook chapter where they only deal with independent variables? If that's the case, then the answer would be Var(X) + Var(Y) = 5 + 12 = 17. But I need to be careful here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether I know that variances add when variables are uncorrelated, but if they are correlated, you need covariance. Since covariance isn't provided, perhaps the answer is that the variance can't be determined with the given information? But the problem is asking for the variance, so maybe they expect us to assume independence. \n\nWait, let me check my notes. In general, Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X,Y). If Cov(X,Y) is not known, then we can't compute Var(X + Y). However, in many introductory problems, unless stated otherwise, it's often assumed that the variables are independent, which makes Cov(X,Y) = 0. Therefore, Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y). \n\nBut I should verify if that's a standard assumption. For example, in probability textbooks, when they give problems like this without mentioning covariance, do they expect students to assume independence? I think sometimes they do, but it's not a universal rule. \n\nWait, let me think. If the problem is in a section that discusses variance of sums without covariance, then maybe they expect the answer to be the sum of variances. Alternatively, if the section covers covariance, then maybe they expect to mention that covariance is needed. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided specific context, I need to make an educated guess. Given that the problem provides all necessary information except covariance, and still asks for the variance, it's likely that we are to assume independence. Therefore, Cov(X,Y) = 0, and Var(X + Y) = 5 + 12 = 17. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to test the knowledge that without covariance, the variance can't be found, but that seems less likely because the problem is asking for a numerical answer. \n\nWait, let me check similar problems online. For example, if you have two variables, X and Y, with given variances and expected values, and you're asked for the variance of X + Y, unless stated otherwise, the standard assumption is independence. So Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y). \n\nTherefore, in this case, Var(X + Y) = 5 + 12 = 17. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recall that Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]. If we don't know E[XY], we can't compute the covariance. Since the problem doesn't give us E[XY], we can't compute Cov(X,Y). Therefore, unless we assume Cov(X,Y) = 0, we can't find Var(X + Y). \n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the variance, and not stating anything about dependence, I think the intended answer is 17. Therefore, the expected value is 99 and the variance is 17. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify with an example. Suppose X and Y are independent. Then Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) = 5 + 12 = 17. If they are not independent, then Var(X + Y) could be more or less depending on the covariance. For example, if Cov(X,Y) is positive, then Var(X + Y) would be more than 17; if it's negative, less than 17. But since we don't have that information, but the problem is asking for a numerical answer, the only possible conclusion is that we should assume independence. \n\nTherefore, the answer is expected value 99 and variance 17. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe expected value of \\(X + Y\\) is \\(\\boxed{99}\\) and the variance is \\(\\boxed{17}\\)."
