        "question": "After a frost warning was issued, the owner of a large orange grove asked his workers to spray all his trees with water. The water was supposed to freeze and form a protective covering of ice around the orange blossom. Nevertheless, the owner suspected that some trees suffered considerable damage due to the frost. To estimate the proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost, he took a random sample of 100 trees from his grove. What is the response variable in this experiment?",
        "response": "In this experiment, the **response variable** is the **proportion of trees that suffered more than 50 percent damage due to the frost**. \n\nThe response variable is the outcome or the variable of interest that is being measured or observed in the study. Here, the owner is specifically interested in estimating the proportion of trees that were significantly damaged by the frost, so this is the response variable. The **explanatory variable** (or independent variable) could be the act of spraying the trees with water, but the focus of the question is on the response variable, which is the damage level."
