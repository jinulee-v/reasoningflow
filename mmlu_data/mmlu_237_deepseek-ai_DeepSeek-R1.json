        "question": "Krete is an unmarried taxpayer with income exclusively from wages. By December 31, year 1, Krete's employer has withheld $16,000 in federal income taxes and Krete has made no estimated tax payments. On April 15, year 2, Krete timely filed for an extension request to file her individual tax return, and paid $300 of additional taxes. Krete's year 1 tax liability was $16,500 when she timely filed her return on April 30, year 2, and paid the remaining tax liability balance. What amount would be subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes?",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. So the question is about Krete and whether she has to pay a penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes usually applies if someone didn't pay enough in taxes throughout the year, either through withholding or estimated payments. The idea is that you can't just wait until April 15th to pay all your taxes; you have to pay as you earn your income.\n\nKrete is unmarried, and her income is only from wages. Her employer withheld $16,000 in federal income taxes by December 31 of year 1. She didn't make any estimated tax payments. Then, on April 15, year 2, she filed for an extension and paid an additional $300. When she filed her return on April 30, year 2, her total tax liability was $16,500, and she paid the remaining balance. The question is asking what amount is subject to the penalty for underpayment.\n\nSo, let's start by recalling the rules for underpayment penalties. Generally, you need to pay at least 90% of your current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's liability (110% if your income is over a certain amount), whichever is less. But since Krete's income is only from wages, maybe she's not required to make estimated payments if her withholding is sufficient. Wait, but maybe she still needs to meet one of those safe harbor rules.\n\nWait, but Krete's total tax liability is $16,500. Her employer withheld $16,000, and she paid $300 with her extension, so total payments are $16,300. That leaves a balance of $200 when she filed her return, which she paid by April 30. But the question is about the underpayment penalty.\n\nThe penalty is calculated based on underpayments in each quarter. But since Krete is a wage earner, her withholding is considered to have been paid evenly throughout the year unless she specifies otherwise. So even if her employer withheld all $16,000 by December 31, the IRS treats withholding as spread out over the year. So each quarter's withholding is considered $16,000 divided by 4, which is $4,000 per quarter.\n\nBut wait, maybe not. Wait, the IRS generally treats withholding as paid when the tax was withheld, but for estimated tax purposes, they can treat withholding as paid proportionally throughout the year unless the taxpayer can show the actual dates. But since Krete is a wage earner, the withholding would be considered as paid throughout the year. So even if her employer withheld all $16,000 in December, for estimated tax purposes, it's treated as if it was withheld evenly each quarter. That might be important.\n\nSo, let's recap. Her total tax liability is $16,500. The total payments are $16,000 withheld plus $300 paid with the extension, totaling $16,300. So she underpaid by $200. But the penalty isn't necessarily on the $200. The penalty is based on the underpayment in each quarter. So we need to figure out if she met the required payment each quarter.\n\nThe required payment each quarter is 25% of the required annual payment. The required annual payment is the lesser of 90% of the current year tax ($16,500 * 90% = $14,850) or 100% of the prior year's tax (but since we don't have prior year's tax info, maybe we can't use that? Wait, the problem doesn't mention prior year's tax. Hmm. So maybe Krete can't use the prior year's tax safe harbor because we don't know if her prior year's tax was, say, less than $16,500. Since the problem doesn't mention it, perhaps we have to assume that the required annual payment is 90% of $16,500, which is $14,850.\n\nTherefore, each quarter's required payment is $14,850 / 4 = $3,712.50.\n\nNow, Krete's withholding is $16,000. If we consider that as spread equally over four quarters, that's $4,000 per quarter. So each quarter, she paid $4,000, which is more than the required $3,712.50. Therefore, she wouldn't have an underpayment in any quarter. Wait, but that seems conflicting with her total payments being $16,300, which is $16,000 withholding plus $300. Wait, but maybe the $300 paid in April is considered a payment for the fourth quarter? Or maybe not, because estimated tax payments are due quarterly, and the April payment would be after the end of the tax year.\n\nWait, estimated tax payments for the fourth quarter are due by January 15 of the following year. If Krete made a payment on April 15, that's after the due date for the fourth quarter estimated payment. So that $300 would be considered a payment with her return, not an estimated tax payment. Therefore, her total withholding is $16,000, and she paid $300 with her extension, but that $300 might not count towards her estimated taxes. Wait, but when you file an extension and make a payment, is that considered an estimated tax payment or a payment towards the tax liability? Hmm.\n\nWait, estimated tax payments are typically made in four installments throughout the year. The due dates are April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 of the following year. If Krete made a payment on April 15, year 2, that would actually be the due date for the first quarter estimated payment for year 2, but she's paying for year 1 taxes. Wait, no. The April 15, year 2 date is the due date for the tax return for year 1, and also the due date for the first quarter estimated payment for year 2. But Krete is paying $300 as part of her extension for year 1's taxes. So that $300 is a payment towards her year 1 tax liability, not an estimated payment for year 2. Therefore, that $300 would be considered a payment with her return, but since she filed an extension, she paid it on April 15, which is the original due date, but she filed an extension to file, not to pay. So she still had to pay any balance due by April 15. Wait, but she paid $300 on April 15, and then paid the remaining $200 on April 30 when she filed.\n\nBut the key point is whether the $300 paid on April 15 counts towards her estimated taxes for year 1. But estimated tax payments for year 1 would have been due in four installments during year 1. Since she didn't make any estimated payments, all her payments are through withholding and the $300 paid with her extension. However, the $300 paid on April 15 is considered a payment towards her year 1 tax liability, but not an estimated tax payment. Therefore, for the purpose of calculating the underpayment penalty, only the withholding counts towards the estimated tax requirements. The $300 and the $200 paid later are not considered estimated tax payments but are payments towards the total liability.\n\nTherefore, her total withholding is $16,000. The required annual payment is 90% of $16,500, which is $14,850. Since her withholding of $16,000 exceeds $14,850, she met the safe harbor. Wait, that can't be right because she still owed $500 when she filed ($16,500 - $16,000 = $500), but she paid $300 on April 15 and $200 on April 30. Wait, but if her withholding was $16,000, which is more than 90% of her tax liability ($14,850), then she wouldn't have an underpayment penalty. But wait, her total tax liability is $16,500, and her withholding was $16,000. So 90% of $16,500 is $14,850. Since $16,000 is more than $14,850, she met the safe harbor. Therefore, she shouldn't have any penalty. But the answer is supposed to be something else. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. The safe harbor is that you have to pay at least the lesser of 90% of the current year's tax or 100% of the prior year's tax. If Krete's prior year's tax was, say, $15,000, then 100% of that is $15,000. So the required annual payment would be the lesser of $14,850 or $15,000, which is $14,850. Since her withholding was $16,000, which is more than $14,850, she meets the safe harbor. Therefore, no penalty. But the problem states that she paid $300 on April 15 and $200 on April 30. Wait, but her total payments are $16,000 + $300 + $200 = $16,500. But the withholding was $16,000, and the other $500 was paid late. But if her withholding alone meets the safe harbor, then the penalty would only apply if the withholding wasn't enough. Wait, but maybe I'm confusing the total payment with the withholding.\n\nWait, the key is that withholding is considered as paid throughout the year, even if it was all withheld in December. So even if her employer withheld all $16,000 in December, for estimated tax purposes, it's treated as if it was paid evenly throughout the year. Therefore, each quarter would have $4,000 withheld. The required payment each quarter is $3,712.50 (which is $14,850 / 4). Since $4,000 per quarter is more than $3,712.50, she met each quarter's requirement. Therefore, there's no underpayment penalty, even though she didn't pay the full $16,500 through withholding. Because the safe harbor is met by the withholding.\n\nBut wait, the problem says she had a $16,500 tax liability and paid $16,300 by April 15, then $200 on April 30. But according to the safe harbor rules, if her withholding was $16,000, which is more than 90% of her tax liability ($14,850), then she doesn't owe a penalty. The fact that she still owed $500 and paid it late might result in a failure to pay penalty, but not an underpayment of estimated tax penalty. The underpayment penalty is specifically for not paying enough during the year through withholding or estimated payments, whereas the failure to pay penalty is for not paying the remaining balance by the deadline.\n\nSo the question is asking for the amount subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes. If she met the safe harbor through withholding, then the answer would be $0. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that her total payments during the year were $16,000, which is less than her total tax liability of $16,500. However, the safe harbor is based on 90% of the current year tax or 100% of prior year's tax. If she didn't have any estimated payments, but her withholding was $16,000, which is more than 90% of $16,500 ($14,850), then she's okay. Therefore, no underpayment penalty.\n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes, if you pay at least 100% of prior year's tax (110% if high income), you can also avoid the penalty. But since we don't have information about the prior year's tax, we can't use that. So the problem must be relying on the 90% rule.\n\nTherefore, since her withholding of $16,000 exceeds 90% of $16,500 ($14,850), she meets the safe harbor and isn't subject to the underpayment penalty. Therefore, the amount subject to penalty is $0.\n\nBut wait, the answer might be $500, which is the total underpayment ($16,500 - $16,000 = $500). But no, because the safe harbor says if you pay at least 90% through withholding and estimated taxes, you're fine. Since she paid $16,000, which is 96.97% of her tax liability ($16,000 / $16,500 \u2248 97%), which is more than 90%, so no penalty.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the $300 paid on April 15 is considered an estimated tax payment for the fourth quarter, which was due January 15. If she didn't make that payment by January 15, then the $300 is late, and thus there's an underpayment for the fourth quarter. But the question is about the amount subject to penalty. Wait, but she didn't make any estimated payments, only withholding. The $300 was paid with her extension, which is after the tax year, so it's not considered an estimated tax payment. Therefore, her only payments are the $16,000 withholding. Since that's enough to meet the 90% safe harbor, there's no penalty.\n\nBut let me check the actual tax underpayment calculation. The penalty is calculated on the amount of underpayment per quarter. So even if the total withholding meets the safe harbor, if in any quarter the amount paid was less than the required amount, there could be a penalty. But since withholding is considered paid evenly, each quarter would have $4,000, which is more than the required $3,712.50. Therefore, no underpayment in any quarter. Hence, no penalty.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $0. But wait, the problem says she paid $300 on April 15, year 2. Does that count towards her tax liability for year 1? Yes, but it's not part of her withholding or estimated payments. It's a payment with her return. So for estimated tax purposes, only the $16,000 withholding counts. Since that's sufficient under the safe harbor, there's no penalty.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me check another angle. Suppose the required annual payment is $16,500 (100% of current year tax), but that's only if her prior year's tax was higher. Wait, no. The required annual payment is the lesser of 90% of current year tax or 100% of prior year tax. If prior year tax is not given, we can't compute that. So assuming she doesn't qualify for the 100% of prior year tax safe harbor (maybe her prior year tax was lower), then the required payment is 90% of $16,500 = $14,850. Since her withholding was $16,000, which is more than $14,850, she meets the safe harbor. Therefore, no penalty.\n\nTherefore, the amount subject to penalty is $0. But let me check the actual underpayment. Her total tax is $16,500. Withholding is $16,000. The underpayment would be $500, but since $16,000 is more than 90% of $16,500, she's not penalized. The remaining $500 is paid late, so there might be a failure to pay penalty, but not an underpayment penalty.\n\nSo the answer should be $0. But wait, the options might not have $0. Wait, the problem says \"what amount would be subject to the penalty\". If the answer is $0, then that's the case. But maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the safe harbor is 90% of the current year tax or 100% of prior year tax, whichever is less. If we don't know prior year tax, but assuming it's less than $16,500, then required payment is prior year tax. But since we don't have that info, the problem must intend us to use 90% of current year. Therefore, answer is $0.\n\nBut let me check another source. According to IRS rules, if your withholding and estimated taxes meet one of the safe harbors, you don't owe a penalty. The safe harbors are:\n\n1. Owe less than $1,000 in tax after subtracting withholding and estimated taxes.\n\n2. Paid at least 90% of the current year's tax liability.\n\n3. Paid at least 100% of the prior year's tax liability (110% if AGI over $150,000).\n\nSince Krete's withholding was $16,000, which is 97% of $16,500, so she meets the second safe harbor (90% of current year). Therefore, no penalty. So the amount subject to penalty is $0.\n\nBut wait, the problem says she paid $300 on April 15 and $200 on April 30. Does that affect anything? No, because those payments are after the tax year, so they don't count towards the estimated tax payments for year 1. They are just payments towards her total liability. The underpayment penalty is based on payments during the year, which in this case were all through withholding. Since the withholding was sufficient under the safe harbor, there's no penalty.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $0. But let me make sure I didn't miss any nuance. For example, sometimes the underpayment is calculated per quarter. If her withholding was all in December, but the IRS treats it as spread through the year, then each quarter's payment is considered $4,000, which is more than the required $3,712.50. Therefore, no underpayment in any quarter. Hence, no penalty.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So the amount subject to penalty is $0."
