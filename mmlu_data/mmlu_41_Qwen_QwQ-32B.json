        "question": "A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a tank with salt solution. Let me try to understand it step by step. The tank initially has 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water. Then, a salt solution with 0.02 grams per liter is being sprayed into the tank at 4 liters per minute. The mixture is kept well-mixed and flows out at the same rate, 4 liters per minute. The question is, how much salt will be in the tank after 100 minutes?\n\nHmm, this sounds like a differential equations problem, specifically a mixing problem. I remember that these kinds of problems involve setting up a differential equation for the amount of salt in the tank at any time t, then solving it. Let me recall the general approach.\n\nFirst, let me denote the amount of salt in the tank at time t as S(t). The goal is to find S(100). \n\nThe rate of change of salt in the tank, dS/dt, should be equal to the rate at which salt is entering the tank minus the rate at which salt is leaving the tank. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the inflow rate of salt is the concentration of the incoming solution times the flow rate. The incoming concentration is 0.02 g/L, and the inflow rate is 4 L/min. Therefore, the inflow rate of salt is 0.02 * 4 = 0.08 grams per minute.\n\nNow, the outflow rate of salt depends on the concentration of salt in the tank at time t. Since the solution is well-mixed, the concentration is uniform. The concentration at time t is S(t) divided by the volume of the solution in the tank. But wait, the volume here is important. Since the inflow and outflow rates are both 4 L/min, the volume remains constant at 100 liters throughout the process. That simplifies things because the volume doesn't change over time. So the concentration is S(t)/100 grams per liter.\n\nTherefore, the outflow rate of salt is the concentration times the outflow rate, which is (S(t)/100) * 4 = (4/100) * S(t) = 0.04 * S(t) grams per minute.\n\nPutting this together, the differential equation is:\n\ndS/dt = inflow rate - outflow rate = 0.08 - 0.04 * S(t)\n\nSo, the equation is dS/dt + 0.04 S = 0.08. That's a linear first-order differential equation. To solve this, I can use an integrating factor.\n\nThe standard form is dS/dt + P(t) S = Q(t). Here, P(t) is 0.04, which is a constant, and Q(t) is 0.08, also a constant. \n\nThe integrating factor, \u03bc(t), is e^(\u222bP(t) dt) = e^(0.04 t). Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(0.04 t) dS/dt + 0.04 e^(0.04 t) S = 0.08 e^(0.04 t)\n\nThe left side is the derivative of [S * e^(0.04 t)] with respect to t. Therefore, we can write:\n\nd/dt [S * e^(0.04 t)] = 0.08 e^(0.04 t)\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to t:\n\n\u222b d[S * e^(0.04 t)] = \u222b 0.08 e^(0.04 t) dt\n\nThe left side integrates to S * e^(0.04 t) + C. The right side integral: Let me compute that. Let me see, the integral of e^(kt) is (1/k) e^(kt), so here k = 0.04, so:\n\n\u222b0.08 e^(0.04 t) dt = 0.08 * (1/0.04) e^(0.04 t) + C = 2 e^(0.04 t) + C\n\nTherefore, putting it back:\n\nS * e^(0.04 t) = 2 e^(0.04 t) + C\n\nDivide both sides by e^(0.04 t):\n\nS(t) = 2 + C e^(-0.04 t)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At time t = 0, S(0) = 3 grams.\n\nSo:\n\n3 = 2 + C e^(0) => 3 = 2 + C => C = 1\n\nTherefore, the solution is S(t) = 2 + e^(-0.04 t)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. If S(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04 t}, then at t=0, S(0)=2 + C = 3, so C=1. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the general solution is S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify the integrating factor steps again because sometimes signs can be tricky.\n\nThe original equation was dS/dt + 0.04 S = 0.08. So when we multiplied by integrating factor e^{0.04 t}, the left side becomes the derivative of S * e^{0.04 t}, which is correct. Then integrating the right side gives 0.08 * integral of e^{0.04 t} dt, which is indeed 0.08*(1/0.04) e^{0.04 t} = 2 e^{0.04 t}. So that's correct. Then dividing by e^{0.04 t} gives S(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04 t}. Then initial condition gives C=1. So that seems okay.\n\nTherefore, the solution is S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}\n\nWait, but when I plug in t=0, that gives 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the initial condition. So that's good.\n\nTherefore, after t minutes, the amount of salt is S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}\n\nWait, but hold on, that seems a bit odd. Let me think again. The steady-state solution when t approaches infinity would be S(t) approaching 2 grams? But the incoming concentration is 0.02 g/L, and the tank volume is 100 L, so the steady-state should be 0.02 * 100 = 2 grams. That makes sense. So as t approaches infinity, the salt approaches 2 grams, which is correct. So the transient term is e^{-0.04 t}, which decays to zero. So the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, after 100 minutes, S(100) = 2 + e^{-0.04 * 100} = 2 + e^{-4}\n\nCalculating e^{-4}, which is approximately... Well, e^4 is about 54.598, so e^{-4} \u2248 1/54.598 \u2248 0.0183. Therefore, S(100) \u2248 2 + 0.0183 \u2248 2.0183 grams. But the question says to present the answer in grams, probably exact form? Wait, maybe they want an exact expression, but maybe they want a decimal? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\" It doesn't specify the form, but in calculus problems like this, sometimes they want an exact value, which would be 2 + e^{-4}, but maybe they want a numerical value. Let me see if e^{-4} is a standard value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again to confirm.\n\nStarting with the differential equation:\n\ndS/dt = (rate in) - (rate out)\n\nRate in is 0.02 g/L * 4 L/min = 0.08 g/min. Correct.\n\nRate out is concentration in tank * outflow rate. Concentration is S(t)/100 g/L, times 4 L/min, so (S/100)*4 = 0.04 S. Correct.\n\nThus, dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S. That's correct.\n\nSolving the DE: linear equation. Integrating factor is e^{\u222b0.04 dt} = e^{0.04 t}. Multiply through:\n\ne^{0.04 t} dS/dt + 0.04 e^{0.04 t} S = 0.08 e^{0.04 t}\n\nLeft side is d/dt [S e^{0.04 t}]. Integrate both sides:\n\nS e^{0.04 t} = \u222b0.08 e^{0.04 t} dt + C\n\nCompute integral: 0.08 / 0.04 e^{0.04 t} + C = 2 e^{0.04 t} + C. Correct.\n\nThus, S(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04 t}\n\nInitial condition S(0)=3 gives C=1. So S(t)=2 + e^{-0.04 t}\n\nTherefore, after 100 minutes, S(100)=2 + e^{-4}\n\nHmm, so that's the exact answer. But maybe they want a decimal? Let me compute e^{-4} more accurately.\n\nWe know that e^{-4} is approximately 0.018315638...\n\nSo 2 + 0.018315638 \u2248 2.018315638 grams. So approximately 2.0183 grams. Depending on the question's requirement, maybe round to two decimal places? 2.02 grams? Or maybe three decimal places? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\" It doesn't specify, but in calculus textbooks, sometimes they prefer exact forms. However, since e^{-4} is a transcendental number, perhaps they want the exact expression? But maybe in the context of an applied problem like this, a decimal is expected. Let me see if the problem gives any clues. The initial amount is 3 grams, the concentration is 0.02 grams per liter, so maybe they expect a decimal to two decimal places? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup? Let me check once more.\n\nWait, the inflow is 4 L/min of 0.02 g/L, so 0.08 g/min. The outflow is 4 L/min of the mixture, whose concentration is S(t)/100, so 4*(S/100) = 0.04 S. So the differential equation is correct.\n\nHmm, so the solution seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 2 + e^{-4}, which is approximately 2.0183 grams. Since the problem might want an exact answer, but in the context of an exam question like AP Calculus or something, they might want the exact value. Wait, but in the problem statement, all the numbers are given as decimals except the initial 3 grams. Let me check units again.\n\nWait, the inflow concentration is 0.02 grams per liter, which is a decimal. The answer is probably expected to be a decimal, rounded to some decimal places. Since 100 minutes is a long time, and the exponential term is e^{-4}, which is about 1.8%, so the amount is approaching 2 grams. So 2.02 grams is reasonable. But let me see if the problem mentions anything about rounding. It just says \"how many grams\", so maybe to the nearest gram? But that would be 2 grams, but that seems too approximate. Alternatively, maybe two decimal places?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integrating factor? Let me check the integration again.\n\nWait, let me rederive the solution again quickly.\n\ndS/dt + 0.04 S = 0.08\n\nIntegrating factor is e^{0.04 t}\n\nMultiply through:\n\ne^{0.04 t} dS/dt + 0.04 e^{0.04 t} S = 0.08 e^{0.04 t}\n\nLeft side is d/dt [S e^{0.04 t}]\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\nS e^{0.04 t} = \u222b0.08 e^{0.04 t} dt + C\n\nCompute integral:\n\n0.08 / 0.04 e^{0.04 t} + C = 2 e^{0.04 t} + C\n\nTherefore, S(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04 t}\n\nYes, that's correct. So the solution is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to model it differently? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute\". Since the inflow and outflow rates are equal, the volume remains constant at 100 liters, so that's okay. The key is that the concentration is S(t)/100. So the setup is correct.\n\nHmm, so I think my solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is 2 + e^{-4} grams. If I have to write it as a decimal, approximately 2.0183 grams. Since the problem might want an exact answer, but in case they want a decimal, maybe two decimal places? Let me see, 2.02 grams. Alternatively, three decimal places, 2.018 grams. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated e^{-4}? Let me compute e^{-4} more precisely.\n\nWe know that e^4 = e^(2*2) = (e^2)^2. e is approximately 2.71828, so e^2 \u2248 7.38906. Then e^4 \u2248 (7.38906)^2 \u2248 54.59815. Therefore, e^{-4} \u2248 1 / 54.59815 \u2248 0.018315638...\n\nTherefore, 2 + 0.018315638 \u2248 2.018315638. So approximately 2.0183 grams. If rounded to the nearest hundredth, that's 2.02 grams. To the nearest thousandth, 2.018 grams. Since the problem didn't specify, but in many cases, two decimal places are standard. Alternatively, maybe they want an exact answer in terms of e^{-4}, but since the question is from an applied perspective, probably a decimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the exponent? Let me check the solution again.\n\nThe general solution after integrating was S(t) e^{0.04 t} = 2 e^{0.04 t} + C. Then moving things around:\n\nS(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04 t}\n\nYes, that's correct. So when t increases, the exponential term decays. So at t=100, it's e^{-4}, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in some other form? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to re-express the equation as S(t) = (initial amount) e^{-kt} + (inflow concentration * volume)(1 - e^{-kt})\n\nWait, let me think of another way to derive it. The standard solution for a linear system like this is S(t) = S_initial e^{-kt} + (rate in / k)(1 - e^{-kt})\n\nWait, let me see. Let me recall that for a mixing problem where the volume is constant, the solution is:\n\nS(t) = [S0 + (rate_in / k) (1 - e^{-kt})] ?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me recall the standard formula.\n\nThe general solution for dS/dt = -k S + r, where r is the constant input rate, is S(t) = (r/k) + (S0 - r/k) e^{-kt}\n\nYes, that's another way to write it. Let me see:\n\nIn our case, the equation is dS/dt = -0.04 S + 0.08. So here, k = 0.04, and r = 0.08. Therefore, the steady-state value is r/k = 0.08 / 0.04 = 2, which matches. Then the solution is S(t) = 2 + (S0 - 2) e^{-0.04 t}\n\nSince S0 is 3, so S(t) = 2 + (3 - 2) e^{-0.04 t} = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}, which is exactly what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 2 + e^{-4}, approximately 2.0183 grams. Since the problem might want an exact answer, but in case they want a decimal, I can write both. Wait, but the problem says \"how many grams\", so maybe they just want the exact value? Hmm, but in the problem statement, all the given numbers are decimals except the initial 3 grams. Maybe they want an exact value in terms of e^{-4}, but perhaps they want a numerical value. Since in engineering or applied math, usually, you give a numerical value. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\" It doesn't specify, but given that it's a math problem, perhaps boxed as an exact expression? But maybe they want a decimal. Since e^{-4} is about 0.0183, so 2.0183. Let me see if 2.02 is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe they want more precise?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup? Let me check once again.\n\nWait, the initial concentration is 3 grams in 100 liters, so 0.03 grams per liter. But the inflow is 0.02 grams per liter, which is less than the initial concentration. Wait, but the inflow concentration is lower than the initial concentration? Wait, but in the problem, the initial concentration is 3 grams in 100 liters, so 0.03 g/L. The incoming solution is 0.02 g/L, which is less. Therefore, over time, the concentration in the tank should decrease towards the incoming concentration. Wait, but according to the solution, the steady-state is 2 grams, which is 0.02 g/L * 100 L = 2 grams. So that's correct. Since the incoming concentration is lower, the tank's concentration should decrease from 3 grams to 2 grams. Therefore, after 100 minutes, it's approaching 2 grams, so 2.0183 grams is reasonable. So that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the time? Wait, 0.04 multiplied by 100 is 4, so e^{-4} is correct. So that's okay.\n\nHmm, so I think my answer is correct. Therefore, I can write the answer as 2 + e^{-4} grams, but if they want a numerical value, approximately 2.02 grams. Since the problem might be expecting an exact value, but given that e^{-4} is a transcendental number, perhaps they want the exact expression? Wait, but in the problem statement, all the numerical values are given as decimals except the initial 3 grams. Maybe they want an exact decimal? Hmm, but e^{-4} can't be expressed as an exact decimal. Alternatively, maybe I need to compute it more precisely?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the answer as 2 + e^{-4} and that's acceptable. Let me see if the problem is from a textbook or an exam where they might prefer the exact form. Since the user hasn't specified, but in most cases, for such problems, they might want the decimal. Let me compute e^{-4} with more precision.\n\nCalculating e^{-4}:\n\nWe can use the Taylor series expansion for e^x, where x = -4. But that might take a while. Alternatively, use a calculator approximation. Since e^4 \u2248 54.59815, so 1/54.59815 \u2248 0.018315638...\n\nTherefore, 2 + 0.018315638 \u2248 2.018315638. Rounding to, say, four decimal places: 2.0183. If we round to three decimal places, it's 2.018. To two decimal places, 2.02. Since 0.0183 is approximately 0.02 when rounded to two decimal places. Wait, 0.0183 is 0.02 when rounded to two decimal places? Wait, 0.0183 is 0.02 when rounded to two decimal places? Wait, no. 0.0183 is 0.02 when rounded to two decimal places? Let me see:\n\nThe third decimal is 8, which is more than 5, so 0.0183 rounded to two decimal places is 0.02. Wait, 0.0183 is 0.01 when rounded to two decimal places? Wait, no. Wait, 0.0183 is 0.02 when rounded to two decimal places?\n\nWait, 0.0183 is 0.01 (first decimal 0, second 1, third 8). Wait, the first decimal is 0, the second is 1, the third is 8. So when rounding to two decimal places, look at the third decimal which is 8, which is \u22655, so round up the second decimal. So 0.01 + 0.008 = 0.018, so 0.018 rounded to two decimals is 0.02? Wait, no. Wait, 0.0183 is 0.02 when rounded to two decimal places?\n\nWait, let me think again. The number is 0.0183. The first decimal place is 0, the second is 1, the third is 8. So when rounding to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal. Since it's 8 (\u22655), we add 1 to the second decimal. So 0.01 becomes 0.02? Wait, no. Wait, the number is 0.01 (tenths place 0, hundredths place 1, thousandths place 8). So adding 1 to the hundredths place: 1 + 1 = 2, so it becomes 0.02. Therefore, 0.0183 rounded to two decimal places is 0.02. Therefore, 2.0183 rounded to two decimal places is 2.02. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if they want three decimal places, it would be 2.018. But since the problem didn't specify, but in many cases, two decimal places are standard. Alternatively, maybe they want an exact fraction? But e^{-4} is irrational. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the differential equation? Let me check once again.\n\nThe rate in is 0.02 g/L * 4 L/min = 0.08 g/min. The rate out is concentration (S(t)/100 g/L) * 4 L/min = (S(t)/25) g/min? Wait, hold on, 4 L/min times S(t)/100 g/L is (4/100)*S(t) = 0.04 S(t). Wait, yes, that's correct. So the rate out is 0.04 S(t). Therefore, the differential equation is correct.\n\nHmm, so I think my answer is correct. Therefore, I can write the answer as approximately 2.02 grams. Alternatively, if they want the exact value, 2 + e^{-4}. Since the problem says \"how many grams\", and in math problems like this, sometimes they prefer the exact form. Let me see if 2 + e^{-4} can be written differently? Not really. Alternatively, maybe they want it as a decimal. Since the problem mentions 0.02 grams per liter, which is a decimal, so maybe they expect a decimal answer. Let me check with approximate value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write both? But the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Probably wants a single answer. Since in calculus problems, sometimes they accept exact forms, but in this case, since e^{-4} is not a standard expression, maybe they want the decimal. Let me see, if I compute e^{-4} \u2248 0.0183156, so 2.0183156. So, to two decimal places, 2.02. To three decimal places, 2.018. Since 100 minutes is a long time, but the exponential decay is still e^{-4} which is about 1.8%, so the answer is just over 2 grams. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another method. Let me try using separation of variables. The differential equation is dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04 S. Let me rearrange terms:\n\ndS / (0.08 - 0.04 S) = dt\n\nWait, but integrating that. Let me see:\n\nLet me write it as dS / (0.08 - 0.04 S) = dt\n\nLet me make substitution u = 0.08 - 0.04 S, then du/dS = -0.04, so du = -0.04 dS, so dS = - du / 0.04\n\nTherefore, the integral becomes \u222b (1/u) * (- du / 0.04) = \u222b dt\n\nWhich gives (-1/0.04) \u222b (1/u) du = \u222b dt\n\nThus, (-1/0.04) ln |u| = t + C\n\nSubstitute back u = 0.08 - 0.04 S:\n\n(-1/0.04) ln |0.08 - 0.04 S| = t + C\n\nMultiply both sides by -0.04:\n\nln |0.08 - 0.04 S| = -0.04 t + C'\n\nExponentiate both sides:\n\n|0.08 - 0.04 S| = e^{-0.04 t + C'} = e^{C'} e^{-0.04 t}\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n0.08 - 0.04 S = K e^{-0.04 t}\n\nWhere K is \u00b1 e^{C'}, but since the exponential is always positive, and depending on initial conditions, K can be positive or negative. Let's solve for S:\n\n0.08 - 0.04 S = K e^{-0.04 t}\n\n=> -0.04 S = K e^{-0.04 t} - 0.08\n\n=> S = (0.08 / 0.04) - (K / 0.04) e^{-0.04 t}\n\n=> S = 2 - (K / 0.04) e^{-0.04 t}\n\nNow apply initial condition S(0) = 3:\n\n3 = 2 - (K / 0.04) e^{0} => 3 = 2 - (K / 0.04)\n\n=> 1 = - (K / 0.04) => K = -0.04\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nS(t) = 2 - (-0.04 / 0.04) e^{-0.04 t} = 2 + e^{-0.04 t}\n\nSame result as before. So that confirms the solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is indeed 2 + e^{-4} \u2248 2.0183 grams. \n\nSince the problem might expect the answer in boxed form, probably as a decimal rounded to two or three decimal places. Since e^{-4} is approximately 0.0183, so 2.0183. Let me check with the exact value:\n\nIf I use more precise e^{-4}:\n\ne^4 = 54.5981500331, so 1/e^4 \u2248 0.01831563888\n\nTherefore, 2 + 0.01831563888 \u2248 2.01831563888. So, to four decimal places, 2.0183. To three, 2.018, to two, 2.02. Since in many cases two decimal places are standard, I think 2.02 is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe they want three decimal places. Let me see if 2.018 is an option? Since the problem didn't specify, but given that the initial amount is 3 grams (an integer), and the inflow concentration is given to two decimal places (0.02), perhaps two decimal places is appropriate. So 2.02 grams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects an exact answer in terms of e^{-4}, but since it's a numerical time (100 minutes), they might want a numerical answer. Let me see if 2.018 is better. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write both? But the instructions say to put the final answer in a box. Since the problem is likely expecting a numerical value, I think 2.02 grams is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe they want more precise. Let me check with the exact value:\n\n2 + e^{-4} \u2248 2.01831563888. So, if I round to the nearest hundredth (two decimal places), it's 2.02. To the nearest thousandth, 2.018. Since 0.0183 is closer to 0.018 than 0.019, so 2.018. Hmm. Since the problem is about grams, maybe two decimal places is sufficient. Alternatively, maybe they want it to three decimal places. Since in the problem, the concentration is given as 0.02 (two decimal places), so maybe two decimal places is okay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact answer, so I can write it as 2 + e^{-4}, but in the problem statement, all given numbers are decimals except the initial 3 grams. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can write both? But the user probably expects a numerical answer. Let me check with the exact value again. Since e^{-4} is about 0.0183, so 2.0183. So, 2.02 grams when rounded to two decimal places. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer as 2.02 grams. Let me see if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent? Let me check the exponent again. The exponent is -0.04 * 100 = -4, so that's correct. So e^{-4} is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with a different approach. Let me compute the integral numerically using Euler's method with a large step size to approximate. Let's see, over 100 minutes, with step size 1 minute. But that would take 100 steps, which is tedious, but maybe do a few steps to see the trend.\n\nStarting at t=0, S=3.\n\nAt t=0, dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04*3 = 0.08 - 0.12 = -0.04 g/min.\n\nSo after 1 minute, approximate S(1) \u2248 3 + (-0.04)*1 = 2.96.\n\nThen at t=1, S=2.96. Compute dS/dt = 0.08 - 0.04*2.96 = 0.08 - 0.1184 = -0.0384.\n\nSo S(2) \u2248 2.96 - 0.0384 = 2.9216.\n\nContinuing this, each step the rate of decrease is slowing down because S is decreasing, so the outflow rate is decreasing. \n\nContinuing this for 100 steps would be time-consuming, but after a long time, it should approach 2. So after 100 minutes, it's very close to 2, but slightly above. The exact value is about 2.0183, so that seems reasonable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the value at t=100 using the formula S(t)=2 + e^{-0.04*100}=2 + e^{-4}\u22482.0183. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is approximately 2.02 grams. Since the problem might want the answer in boxed form, I can write that as \\boxed{2.02}. Alternatively, if they prefer the exact value, \\boxed{2 + e^{-4}}. But given the problem's context, I think the numerical value is more likely expected. Let me see if 2.02 is correct. Since e^{-4} is approximately 0.0183, so 2 + 0.0183 is 2.0183, which is 2.02 when rounded to two decimal places. So I think that's the answer they want.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2.02}\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a tank initially containing 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution with a concentration of 0.02 grams per liter is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute, and the mixture flows out at the same rate, keeping the volume constant. We need to determine the amount of salt in the tank after 100 minutes.\n\n1. **Setting up the differential equation:**\n   - The rate of salt entering the tank: \\(0.02 \\, \\text{g/L} \\times 4 \\, \\text{L/min} = 0.08 \\, \\text{g/min}\\).\n   - The rate of salt leaving the tank: \\(\\frac{S(t)}{100} \\, \\text{g/L} \\times 4 \\, \\text{L/min} = 0.04 S(t) \\, \\text{g/min}\\).\n   - The differential equation is: \\(\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0.08 - 0.04 S(t)\\).\n\n2. **Solving the differential equation:**\n   - This is a linear first-order differential equation. Using an integrating factor \\(e^{0.04t}\\):\n     \\[\n     e^{0.04t} \\frac{dS}{dt} + 0.04 e^{0.04t} S = 0.08 e^{0.04t}\n     \\]\n   - Integrating both sides:\n     \\[\n     S(t) e^{0.04t} = 2 e^{0.04t} + C\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\(S(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     S(t) = 2 + C e^{-0.04t}\n     \\]\n   - Applying the initial condition \\(S(0) = 3\\):\n     \\[\n     3 = 2 + C \\implies C = 1\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the solution is:\n     \\[\n     S(t) = 2 + e^{-0.04t}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating at \\(t = 100\\) minutes:**\n   - Substitute \\(t = 100\\):\n     \\[\n     S(100) = 2 + e^{-0.04 \\times 100} = 2 + e^{-4}\n     \\]\n   - Approximating \\(e^{-4} \\approx 0.0183\\):\n     \\[\n     S(100) \\approx 2 + 0.0183 = 2.0183\n     \\]\n   - Rounding to two decimal places, the result is approximately \\(2.02\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{2.02}\\)."
