        "question": "Earth Hour was a campaign launched by which organization?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which organization launched Earth Hour. Let me start by recalling what Earth Hour is. From what I remember, Earth Hour is an annual event where people around the world turn off their lights for one hour to raise awareness about climate change and environmental issues. The event usually happens in late March, I think.\n\nNow, the question is asking which organization started this campaign. I'm trying to remember if it's a well-known environmental group. The big ones I can think of are Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), maybe the Sierra Club? Let me think. \n\nI've heard that WWF does a lot of work with conservation and climate change. Earth Hour involves a lot of public participation and global coordination, which sounds like something a large organization like WWF could handle. Greenpeace is also a possibility, but I'm not sure if they specifically started Earth Hour. \n\nWait, I think there was a news article a while back that mentioned WWF in relation to Earth Hour. Let me try to recall any specific details. The first Earth Hour was in Sydney, Australia, in 2007. If WWF has a presence there, that might make sense. Also, WWF often uses symbolic gestures to raise awareness, like the panda logo, so turning off lights fits that approach. \n\nAlternatively, could it be a different organization? Maybe a local Australian group that later partnered with a larger international organization? But no, I think the campaign was started by WWF from the beginning. Let me check my memory. Yes, I believe the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched Earth Hour in 2007 in Sydney as a way to engage people in the fight against climate change. \n\nI don't think it's the United Nations because their campaigns usually have different branding, like Earth Day is separate, though sometimes confused. Earth Day is in April, but Earth Hour is a different event. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the most likely answer is the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). I'm pretty confident about that, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider other possibilities. For example, the Earth Hour website might list the organizing body. If I were to look it up, I'd probably see WWF mentioned as the founder. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes campaigns are started by collaborations between multiple organizations, but in this case, I think it's primarily WWF. Yeah, I'm going to stick with WWF as the answer here."
