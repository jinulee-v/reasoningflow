        "question": "In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this genetics problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that in a population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. We're assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and we need to find the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but don't develop the cancer. Hmm, carriers, right? So those are the heterozygotes, Bb.\n\nFirst, let me recall the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (B) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (b). The homozygous recessives (bb) have the cancer, so their frequency is q\u00b2. The problem states that 1 out of 400 has this cancer, so q\u00b2 = 1/400. Therefore, q is the square root of 1/400. Let me calculate that.\n\nSquare root of 1 is 1, square root of 400 is 20. So q = 1/20 = 0.05. Then p, which is 1 - q, would be 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. So p = 0.95.\n\nNow, the carriers are the heterozygotes, which are represented by 2pq in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. So I need to compute 2 * p * q. Let's plug in the numbers: 2 * 0.95 * 0.05. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.95 multiplied by 0.05. 0.95 * 0.05 is 0.0475. Then multiply by 2: 0.0475 * 2 = 0.095. So 0.095 is the frequency of heterozygotes. To express this as a proportion, that's 9.5/100 or 9.5%. But the question asks for the expected proportion, so maybe they want it as a fraction or a decimal?\n\nWait, the answer options might not be given, but since the user hasn't provided options, I need to present the answer as a boxed number. Let me check if my calculation is correct.\n\nGiven that q\u00b2 = 1/400, so q = 1/20 = 0.05. Then p = 19/20 = 0.95. Then heterozygotes are 2 * 0.95 * 0.05 = 0.095. So 0.095 is 9.5%, which is equivalent to 19/200, because 0.095 is 95/1000, which simplifies to 19/200. Let me confirm: 19 divided by 200 is 0.095. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the answer as a fraction. Let me see. 1/400 is the frequency of bb individuals. Then carriers are 2pq. So 2 * (19/20) * (1/20) = 38/400 = 19/200. Yes, that's 19/200. So 19/200 is equal to 0.095, which is 9.5%.\n\nTherefore, the expected proportion of carriers is 19/200 or 9.5%. Since the question says \"expected proportion,\" either form is acceptable, but maybe as a fraction. Let me check if 19/200 reduces further. 19 is a prime number, so 19/200 is the simplest form.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The frequency of bb is q\u00b2 = 1/400, so q = 1/20. Then p = 1 - q = 19/20. Then heterozygotes are 2pq = 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = (38)/400 = 19/200. Yes, that's correct. So 19/200 is 0.095, which is 9.5%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 19/200 or 0.095. Depending on how the question expects the answer, but since it's a proportion, both are correct. However, in genetics problems, sometimes fractions are preferred, but decimals are also acceptable. Let me check if 19/200 is indeed equal to 0.095. 19 divided by 200: 200 goes into 19 zero times. 200 goes into 190 zero times. 200 goes into 1900 nine times (9*200=1800), remainder 100. Bring down a zero: 1000. 200 goes into 1000 five times. So 0.095. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 19/200. Either way, both are correct. But since the question says \"proportion,\" and in H-W problems, fractions are often presented as their reduced form. So 19/200 is the exact fraction. Alternatively, 0.095 is the decimal. But let me check if the problem specifies how to present the answer. The original problem says \"expected proportion,\" so either is fine, but maybe they want it as a fraction. Let me see if 19/200 can be simplified more. 19 is prime, 200 is 2^3 * 5^2, so no common factors. So 19/200 is simplest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 9.5%, but percentages can also be acceptable. However, since the initial data was given as 1 out of 400, which is a fraction, perhaps the answer is expected as a fraction. So 19/200. Let me confirm once more.\n\nIf q\u00b2 = 1/400, then q = 1/20. Then p = 19/20. Then 2pq = 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = 38/400 = 19/200. Yes, that's correct. So 19/200 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the expected proportion of carriers is 19/200, which is 0.095 or 9.5%. Since the problem didn't specify the format, but in exams, sometimes fractions are preferred unless stated otherwise. However, since the user hasn't given options, I should present it as 19/200 or 0.095. But let me check if there's another way to represent it. Wait, 19/200 is equal to 38/400, but 38/400 simplifies to 19/200. So 19/200 is the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe converting it to a percentage: 9.5%. But the question says \"proportion,\" which can be a decimal or a fraction. Since the initial data was given as a ratio (1 out of 400), perhaps the answer is expected as a fraction. So 19/200. Alternatively, 0.095. Either is correct, but maybe the answer is 19/200. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the frequency of bb is 1/400, so q\u00b2 = 1/400, so q = 1/20. Then the frequency of Bb is 2pq = 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = 38/400 = 19/200. So yes, 19/200. Therefore, I think 19/200 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in interpreting the question. The problem says \"carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer.\" So that's exactly the heterozygotes, Bb, because bb would develop the cancer. So yes, heterozygotes are carriers and don't develop the cancer. So 2pq is the right term to calculate. So yes, 2pq = 19/200. So I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 19/200, which is 0.095. So I can write either, but since the problem didn't specify, but in H-W problems, fractions are often presented as reduced fractions. So 19/200. Alternatively, 0.095. But let me check if 19/200 is indeed 0.095. 19 divided by 200: 200 x 0.09 = 18, 19 - 18 = 1, bring down a zero: 10. 200 goes into 10 zero times, add decimal: 0.09, then 200 goes into 100 0.005 times. So total 0.095. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 19/200 or 0.095. Since the user wants the answer in a box, probably as a fraction. So I'll go with 19/200. Wait, but let me check once more. If 1/400 is bb, then q\u00b2 = 1/400, q = 1/20. Then p = 19/20. Then 2pq = 2*(19/20)*(1/20) = 38/400 = 19/200. Yes, correct. So 19/200 is the right answer. So I think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe expected proportion of carriers is \\boxed{\\dfrac{19}{200}}."
