        "question": "Which of the following conditions does not show multifactorial inheritance?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which condition doesn't show multifactorial inheritance. Let me start by recalling what multifactorial inheritance means. From what I remember, multifactorial disorders are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Unlike single-gene disorders, which are caused by mutations in one specific gene, multifactorial conditions involve multiple genes along with lifestyle or environmental factors. Examples I know include heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.\n\nThe question is asking which of the following conditions does not fit into this category. But wait, the user hasn't provided the list of options. Hmm, maybe they forgot to include them? Wait, looking back at the original question: \"Which of the following conditions does not show multifactorial inheritance?\" But there are no options listed here. That's a problem. Wait, maybe this is part of a test and the options were provided elsewhere? Since I don't have the options, I need to think of common conditions and determine which ones are multifactorial versus those that are not.\n\nLet me list some common multifactorial conditions first. These include hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, certain congenital malformations like cleft lip or palate, neural tube defects, and some heart diseases. These all have both genetic predisposition and environmental influences.\n\nOn the other hand, conditions that are not multifactorial would be those caused by single-gene mutations (Mendelian disorders) like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, or chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome. Also, some conditions might be purely environmental, like trauma or infections, but those are not genetic at all.\n\nSo if the options include something like cystic fibrosis or Huntington's, those are single-gene disorders and would not be multifactorial. If the options include something like diabetes or heart disease, those are multifactorial. So the answer would be the condition that is a Mendelian single-gene disorder or a chromosomal abnormality.\n\nBut since I don't have the actual options, I can't be certain. However, based on typical exam questions, common examples used are things like cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, or maybe Down syndrome. So if one of those is in the options, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe something like a simple dominant or recessive trait, like achondroplasia (which is autosomal dominant) would be another example.\n\nWait, neural tube defects are multifactorial, cleft lip/palate too. So if the options include, say, spina bifida (a neural tube defect), that's multifactorial. So the one that's not would be something like cystic fibrosis. So the answer is cystic fibrosis, assuming that's one of the options. But again, without seeing the options, I'm speculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick one. For example, some conditions that people might think are multifactorial but actually have a strong single-gene component. But usually, multifactorial conditions are contrasted against Mendelian or chromosomal disorders.\n\nAnother angle: Multifactorial inheritance involves additive effects of multiple genes plus environment. So if a condition is caused by a single gene, even if it's influenced by environment (like phenylketonuria where diet matters), it's still a single-gene disorder. So PKU is a single-gene (autosomal recessive) disorder, even though environment (diet) plays a role in the phenotype. So maybe PKU is an option? But PKU is Mendelian, not multifactorial.\n\nSo, in summary, the condition that does not show multifactorial inheritance would be a Mendelian disorder (autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked) or a chromosomal disorder. So among typical options, that's the answer."
