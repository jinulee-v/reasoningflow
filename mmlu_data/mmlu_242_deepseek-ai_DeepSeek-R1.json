        "question": "Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which kind of fact a judge shouldn't take judicial notice of. Let me start by recalling what judicial notice means. From what I remember, judicial notice is when a court accepts a fact as true without requiring evidence because it's common knowledge or can be easily verified from a reliable source. The idea is to save time on proving obvious facts.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options isn't appropriate for judicial notice. Let me think about the categories of facts that are typically subject to judicial notice. There are two main types: facts that are generally known within the jurisdiction (like common knowledge) and facts that can be accurately and readily determined from reliable sources (like scientific data, historical events, etc.).\n\nSo, examples might include things like the date of a public holiday, historical events, geographical locations, scientific principles (like water boils at 100\u00b0C at sea level), or laws. These are facts that aren't really disputable and are easily verifiable.\n\nOn the flip side, facts that are not appropriate would be those that are not common knowledge or can't be easily verified. For instance, if a fact is subject to reasonable dispute, or requires specialized knowledge that isn't widely accepted, then judicial notice wouldn't be appropriate. Also, facts that are specific to a case and need evidence to prove, like whether a defendant was at a certain place at a certain time, those need to be proven through testimony or other evidence.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's a more precise legal standard. In the U.S., under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE 201), judicial notice applies to adjudicative facts, not legislative facts. Adjudicative facts are those relevant to the particular case, like who did what, whereas legislative facts are more general and relate to legal reasoning and policy making. But wait, FRE 201(b) says a court can take judicial notice of a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it is generally known within the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction or can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\n\nSo, inappropriate facts would be those that are disputable or not easily verifiable. For example, if a judge took judicial notice of a fact that's actually debated among experts, that would be inappropriate. Or a fact that's specific to the case and requires evidence, like the mental state of a person, which can't be just noticed because it's subjective.\n\nAnother example: a judge can't take judicial notice of the truth of hearsay statements just because they're in a public record. Or, maybe facts that are not common knowledge in the jurisdiction. For instance, if a judge in one state took judicial notice of a local custom from another state without proper sources, that might be inappropriate.\n\nWait, but the question is about which is NOT appropriate. So, possible answer types could be: facts that are subject to reasonable dispute, not generally known, or not verifiable from a reliable source. So, for example, if one of the options was \"the defendant's intent on the day of the crime,\" that's a specific fact needing evidence, so judicial notice wouldn't be appropriate. Alternatively, if the fact is a scientific theory that's not widely accepted, like maybe a new hypothesis that's not peer-reviewed or generally recognized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe statistical data from a non-authoritative source. But if the data is from a reputable source like the Census Bureau, then it's okay. But if it's from a random website, then not.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the inappropriate fact for judicial notice would be something that's either not generally known in the jurisdiction or cannot be accurately and readily determined from a reliable source. So, for example, a fact that's in dispute between the parties, or a fact that requires expert testimony to establish because it's not commonly known or easily verifiable.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be a fact that is subject to reasonable dispute or not capable of immediate and accurate verification. So, if the options included something like \"the exact speed of a car involved in an accident based on skid marks without expert testimony,\" that's something the judge can't take notice of because it requires expert analysis. Alternatively, \"the defendant's state of mind at the time of the incident\" would be inappropriate because that's a subjective fact needing evidence.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the options, I need to answer in general terms. Wait, the original question says \"Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?\" but the user hasn't listed the options. Wait, maybe this is a general question expecting a general answer. Wait, perhaps the user is using this as a study prompt, and expects me to know the standard categories.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is that adjudicative facts that are in dispute or not capable of being indisputably verified. But perhaps more specifically, under FRE 201, judicial notice cannot be taken of a fact that is subject to reasonable dispute. So, the inappropriate kind is a fact that is subject to reasonable dispute. Therefore, the answer would be a fact that is not generally known or capable of accurate and ready determination, or one that is subject to reasonable dispute.\n\nAlternatively, another angle: legislative facts vs. adjudicative facts. Courts can take judicial notice of legislative facts without following FRE 201, but adjudicative facts must meet the criteria. But the question is about which fact is not appropriate for judicial notice, so perhaps a fact that is an adjudicative fact but is disputed.\n\nBut since the question is presented as a multiple-choice without options, but the user is asking me to provide the answer, perhaps the standard answer is that facts which are subject to reasonable dispute are not appropriate. So, the answer would be something like \"a fact that is subject to reasonable dispute\" or \"a fact that is not generally known or capable of ready verification.\"\n\nBut maybe the answer is more specific. For example, in law school exams, common examples include: courts can take notice of public records, laws, scientific facts, historical events, etc. Inappropriate ones are facts like the defendant's guilt, credibility of a witness, or facts that are not verifiable.\n\nAlternatively, another example: a judge cannot take judicial notice of the content of another court's records if they are not relevant to the current case, but if they are relevant and from a reliable source, maybe they can. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that a judge cannot take judicial notice of a fact that is not beyond reasonable dispute. So, for example, if a fact is controversial or not settled, like whether a certain drug causes cancer if the scientific community is divided on it, then judicial notice would be inappropriate.\n\nAlternatively, a fact that is not common knowledge in the jurisdiction. For example, if a judge in Texas took judicial notice of a local custom in Maine without a source, that's inappropriate.\n\nBut since the question is about the kind of fact, not the location, the key point is that the fact must be either generally known or verifiable from an indisputable source. Therefore, the inappropriate kind is a fact that doesn't meet those criteria.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be that facts which are not generally known in the jurisdiction or cannot be accurately and readily verified from a reliable source are inappropriate for judicial notice. Therefore, the example would be a disputed fact or one requiring specialized knowledge not easily confirmed."
