People with an internal locus of control tend to take responsibility for their successes and failures, feel empowered to make changes, and believe they can shape their future through their behavior and attitudes.\n\nThis contrasts with an **external locus of control**, where individuals believe that external factors (e.g., luck, fate, or other people) primarily determine what happens to them."
