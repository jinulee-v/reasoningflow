Singer, a utilitarian, argues that **pleasure** and the **reduction of suffering** are intrinsic goods. These are valuable for their own sake, rather than for any further purpose they might serve.\n\nIn contrast, things like money, power, or material possessions are not intrinsic goods because their value is instrumental\u2014they are only valuable insofar as they help achieve other ends, such as happiness or well-being.\n\nSo, in the context of Singer's philosophy, **pleasure** or **the absence of suffering** would be considered intrinsic goods."
