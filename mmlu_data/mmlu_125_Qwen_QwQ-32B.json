        "question": "Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)",
        "response": "Okay, so Joe is in charge of the lights for a dance, and there are three colored lights: red, yellow, and blue. Each one blinks at different intervals: red every 2 seconds, yellow every 3 seconds, and blue every 5 seconds. The question is asking how many times during a seven-minute dance all three lights will come on at the same time. They also mention to include the very beginning and the very end of the dance. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. All three lights start blinking together at the very beginning of the dance. Then, each one blinks at their respective intervals. We need to find out how many times this\u540c\u6b65 (synchronized blinking) happens again during the seven minutes, including the start and end if they coincide. \n\nHmm, so the key here is probably to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their blinking intervals. Because the LCM of 2, 3, and 5 will give the number of seconds after which all three lights will blink together again. Then, once we have that LCM, we can figure out how many such intervals fit into the total duration of the dance, which is seven minutes. \n\nBut first, let me confirm the units. The dance duration is given in minutes, but the blinking intervals are in seconds. So I need to convert seven minutes into seconds to make the units consistent. \n\nSeven minutes is 7 * 60 = 420 seconds. Got that. \n\nNow, let me recall how to compute the LCM of multiple numbers. The LCM of two numbers can be found by dividing the product of the two numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). For three numbers, the process is similar. Alternatively, I can factor each number into primes and take the maximum exponent for each prime. Let me try that method here. \n\nBreaking down each interval into prime factors:\n\n- 2 is already a prime: 2\n- 3 is already a prime: 3\n- 5 is already a prime: 5\n\nSo the LCM would be the product of the highest powers of all primes present. Since each number here is a different prime, the LCM is just 2 * 3 * 5 = 30. \n\nTherefore, the three lights will all blink together every 30 seconds. \n\nNow, the next step is to figure out how many 30-second intervals are in 420 seconds. \n\nDividing 420 by 30 gives 14. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. If we divide 420 by 30, that gives exactly 14. But does that mean there are 14 intervals, so 15 times including the starting point? Hmm, actually, when you divide the total time by the interval, you get the number of intervals, but the number of times the event occurs is the number of intervals plus one. \n\nLet me think of a simpler example. Suppose the dance was 30 seconds long. Then, the lights would blink together at 0 seconds and 30 seconds. So that's two times, which is (30/30) +1 = 2. Similarly, if it was 60 seconds, then 60/30 = 2 intervals, so 3 times. \n\nTherefore, in 420 seconds, which is 14 intervals of 30 seconds each, the number of\u540c\u6b65 blinking times would be 14 +1 = 15. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me confirm again. The problem says \"how many times during a seven-minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time, including the very beginning and very end.\" \n\nSo, if the dance is exactly 420 seconds, then the last blink would be at 420 seconds. Let me check if 420 is a multiple of 30. Since 30*14=420, yes, so the last blink is exactly at the end. Therefore, the number of times is 14 +1 =15. \n\nBut let me think again step by step to make sure I didn't skip anything. \n\nFirst, LCM of 2,3,5 is 30. So every 30 seconds, they all blink together. Starting at 0 seconds. Then the next would be at 30, 60, 90,... up to 420. \n\nSo the times when they all blink together are 0, 30, 60, ..., 420. \n\nTo find how many terms are in that sequence. \n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 =0, common difference d=30, last term an=420. \n\nThe formula for the number of terms is ((an - a1)/d ) +1. \n\nSo ((420 -0)/30)+1 = (420/30)+1=14 +1=15. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 15. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any possible mistake here. \n\nIs the LCM really 30? Let me confirm. \n\nMultiples of 2: 2,4,6,8,10,...,30,...\n\nMultiples of 3:3,6,9,...,30,...\n\nMultiples of 5:5,10,...,30,...\n\nThe first common multiple is 30. So yes, LCM is 30. \n\nTotal time is 7 minutes = 420 seconds. \n\nNumber of\u540c\u6b65 times is 420 divided by 30, which is 14 intervals, so 15 times. \n\nHmm, seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the \"very end\" as an additional time? Wait, but if the dance ends exactly at 420 seconds, and the last\u540c\u6b65 blink is at 420, then that is included. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes in these problems, if the event happens exactly at the end, whether to count it or not. But the problem says \"include the very beginning and very end\", so since the end coincides with a blink, it should be included. \n\nTherefore, 15 is the answer. \n\nBut let me think again with another approach. Let's list out the times when all three blink together. \n\nStart at 0 seconds. Then 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 390, 420. \n\nLet me count these:\n\n1. 0\n\n2. 30\n\n3. 60\n\n4. 90\n\n5. 120\n\n6. 150\n\n7. 180\n\n8. 210\n\n9. 240\n\n10. 270\n\n11. 300\n\n12. 330\n\n13. 360\n\n14. 390\n\n15. 420\n\nYes, that's 15 times. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 15. \n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me check if the problem says \"during a seven minute dance\". So does the end count as during? The problem says \"include the very beginning and very end\", so yes, they should be included. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes in timing problems, the end is excluded if the event is instantaneous at the end, but here since they specifically say to include the very end, so it's okay. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 15. \n\nBut let me check once again with another method. \n\nSuppose we model each light's blinking times:\n\nRed blinks at 2,4,6,...420 seconds.\n\nYellow at 3,6,9,...420.\n\nBlue at 5,10,15,...,420.\n\nThe common blinking times are the common multiples of 2,3,5 up to 420. The LCM is 30, so the common multiples are multiples of 30. So the number of multiples of 30 from 0 to 420 inclusive. \n\nNumber of multiples of 30 in that range is floor(420/30) +1 =14 +1=15. \n\nYes, that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 15. \n\nWait, but let me check if 0 is considered. Since the problem says \"include the very beginning and very end\". The very beginning is 0, and the very end is 420. So if all the lights come on at the same time at 0 and 420, so those are included. \n\nTherefore, the total number is 15. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 15. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming LCM is 30? Let me check with actual timings. \n\nAt t=0: all blink.\n\nNext possible time is 30. Let's see:\n\nRed blinks every 2 seconds, so at 2,4,...30. So yes, red is at 30.\n\nYellow every 3 seconds: 3,6,...30. So yes, yellow at 30.\n\nBlue every 5 seconds: 5,10,...30. So blue at 30. \n\nSo yes, they all blink at 30. Similarly, 60, etc. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the conversion of minutes to seconds? 7 minutes is 7x60=420. Yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so I think my answer is correct. 15 times. \n\nBut let me see if there's any possible off-by-one error here. \n\nSuppose the dance was 30 seconds long. Then according to the formula, it would be 30/30 +1= 2 times (0 and 30). That's correct. \n\nIf the dance was 1 second, then 1/30 is 0.033, so floor(1/30)=0, so 0+1=1 (only the start). That's correct. \n\nIf the dance was 29 seconds, then floor(29/30)=0, so 1 time. \n\nAt 30 seconds, it's 2 times. \n\nSo formula works. \n\nTherefore, 420 seconds gives 14 +1=15. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 15. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time\". So if the dance is exactly seven minutes, which is 420 seconds, then the last blink is exactly at the end. So that is included. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 15. \n\nHmm, I think that's solid. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{15}\n</think>\n\nJoe is in charge of the lights for a dance, and the red, yellow, and blue lights blink every 2, 3, and 5 seconds respectively. We need to determine how many times all three lights will come on at the same time during a seven-minute dance, including the beginning and end.\n\nFirst, we convert the dance duration from minutes to seconds:\n\\[\n7 \\text{ minutes} = 7 \\times 60 = 420 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of the blinking intervals (2, 3, and 5 seconds). The LCM of these numbers is calculated by taking the highest power of each prime factor:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(2, 3, 5) = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 30\n\\]\n\nThis means all three lights will blink together every 30 seconds. To find how many times this occurs during the 420-second dance, we divide the total duration by the LCM and add 1 (to include the starting point):\n\\[\n\\frac{420}{30} = 14\n\\]\n\\[\n14 + 1 = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of times all the lights come on at the same time during the dance is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]"
