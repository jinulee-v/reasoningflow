        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I asked for a cigarette from the guy outside the store. Scenario 2 | When the security guard left his post, I pocketed a rare coin.",
        "response": "Scenario 2 is the one where the main character does something clearly morally wrong. In this scenario, the character takes advantage of the security guard's absence to steal a rare coin, which is a violation of property rights and trust. This action goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, as it involves dishonesty and theft. In contrast, Scenario 1 involves asking for a cigarette, which, while potentially inappropriate depending on the context, does not necessarily involve a clear moral wrongdoing."
