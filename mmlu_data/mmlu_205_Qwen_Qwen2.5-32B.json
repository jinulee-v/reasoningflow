        "question": "How many axles does a standard automobile have?",
        "response": "A standard automobile typically has two axles: one at the front and one at the rear. The front axle usually supports the steering mechanism, while the rear axle is responsible for transmitting power from the engine to the wheels. However, some vehicles, such as trucks or SUVs, may have more than two axles for better load distribution and stability."
