        "question": "Which of the following cases established the precedent that a defendant must be informed of the right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer, and protection from self-incrimination?",
        "response": "The case that established the precedent that a defendant must be informed of the right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer, and protection from self-incrimination is Miranda v. Arizona. This landmark case was decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1966. The court ruled that the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel must be made clear to suspects in police custody before any interrogation takes place. This ruling led to the creation of the Miranda warning, which is now commonly used by law enforcement agencies across the United States."
