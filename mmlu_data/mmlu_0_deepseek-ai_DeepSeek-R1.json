        "question": "Find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find all values of c in Z_3 such that the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 + c) is a field. Hmm, let me start by recalling some concepts. I know that for a quotient ring of the form F[x]/(f(x)) to be a field, the polynomial f(x) must be irreducible over the field F. So in this case, F is Z_3, and f(x) is x\u00b2 + c. Therefore, I need to determine for which c in Z_3 the polynomial x\u00b2 + c is irreducible over Z_3.\n\nFirst, let me remember what Z_3 is. It's the set {0, 1, 2} with addition and multiplication modulo 3. So c can be 0, 1, or 2. Now, a quadratic polynomial over a field is irreducible if it has no roots in that field. So, for x\u00b2 + c to be irreducible, there should be no elements a in Z_3 such that a\u00b2 + c \u2261 0 mod 3. In other words, the equation x\u00b2 \u2261 -c mod 3 should have no solutions.\n\nBut since we're working modulo 3, let's compute the squares of all elements in Z_3 to see what the possible quadratic residues are. Let's see:\n\n- 0\u00b2 = 0 mod 3\n- 1\u00b2 = 1 mod 3\n- 2\u00b2 = 4 \u2261 1 mod 3\n\nSo the squares in Z_3 are only 0 and 1. That means x\u00b2 can only be 0 or 1 in Z_3. Therefore, x\u00b2 + c \u2261 0 mod 3 would imply x\u00b2 \u2261 -c mod 3. But since x\u00b2 can only be 0 or 1, we can check for each c whether -c is 0 or 1 modulo 3.\n\nWait, but first, let's note that in Z_3, -0 \u2261 0, -1 \u2261 2, and -2 \u2261 1. So:\n\n- If c = 0, then -c = 0. So x\u00b2 \u2261 0 mod 3. The solutions are x \u2261 0 mod 3. So x\u00b2 + 0 factors as x\u00b2, which is reducible (since x is a factor). Therefore, Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2) is not a field because x\u00b2 is reducible.\n\n- If c = 1, then -c = -1 \u2261 2 mod 3. So x\u00b2 \u2261 2 mod 3. But from earlier, squares in Z_3 are only 0 and 1. Therefore, x\u00b2 \u2261 2 has no solutions. Hence, x\u00b2 + 1 is irreducible over Z_3, so the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 + 1) is a field.\n\n- If c = 2, then -c = -2 \u2261 1 mod 3. So x\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 3. The solutions to this are x \u2261 1 and x \u2261 2 mod 3, since 1\u00b2 = 1 and 2\u00b2 = 4 \u2261 1. Therefore, x\u00b2 + 2 factors as (x + 1)(x + 2) in Z_3[x]. Wait, let me check that:\n\nMultiply (x + 1)(x + 2) in Z_3[x]:\n\n= x\u00b2 + (1 + 2)x + (1)(2)\n= x\u00b2 + 3x + 2\nBut 3x \u2261 0 mod 3, so this simplifies to x\u00b2 + 2. So yes, x\u00b2 + 2 factors as (x + 1)(x + 2) in Z_3[x], hence it's reducible. Therefore, Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 + 2) is not a field.\n\nTherefore, the only c in Z_3 for which x\u00b2 + c is irreducible is c = 1. Hence, Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 + 1) is a field.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check. When c = 1, the polynomial is x\u00b2 + 1. Let me check if it factors. Suppose x\u00b2 + 1 factors into (x + a)(x + b) where a, b \u2208 Z_3. Then expanding gives x\u00b2 + (a + b)x + ab. Comparing coefficients:\n\n- a + b \u2261 0 mod 3 (since the coefficient of x is 0 in x\u00b2 + 1)\n- ab \u2261 1 mod 3\n\nFrom a + b \u2261 0 mod 3, we have b \u2261 -a mod 3. Then substituting into ab \u2261 1:\n\na*(-a) \u2261 -a\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 3\n\nSo -a\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 3 \u21d2 a\u00b2 \u2261 -1 \u2261 2 mod 3. But earlier, we saw that squares in Z_3 are only 0 and 1. Therefore, there is no a in Z_3 such that a\u00b2 \u2261 2 mod 3. Therefore, x\u00b2 + 1 does not factor into linear terms over Z_3, so it is indeed irreducible. Therefore, the quotient ring is a field.\n\nSimilarly, when c = 2, we saw that x\u00b2 + 2 factors as (x + 1)(x + 2), so it's reducible. Therefore, the quotient ring isn't a field. And when c = 0, x\u00b2 is obviously reducible. So only c = 1 works.\n\nBut wait, hold on again. Let me check if maybe when c = 2, even though it factors, maybe the quotient ring is still a field? No, because if the polynomial is reducible, then the quotient ring would have zero divisors. For example, in Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 + 2), since x\u00b2 + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2), then the images of (x + 1) and (x + 2) in the quotient ring would multiply to zero. Therefore, the quotient ring isn't a domain, hence not a field. So yes, only c = 1 gives a field.\n\nBut wait, another thought: maybe the polynomial could be irreducible even if it factors? Wait, no. Irreducible means it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials. So if it factors into linear terms, it's definitely reducible. Therefore, only irreducible polynomials give fields when taking the quotient.\n\nTherefore, conclusion: c = 1 is the only value in Z_3 for which Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 + c) is a field.\n\nBut let me check once more for c = 1. Let's list all polynomials of degree 2 over Z_3 and check their reducibility.\n\nThe monic quadratics over Z_3 are:\n\nx\u00b2 + ax + b, where a, b \u2208 Z_3.\n\nA monic quadratic is reducible if and only if it factors as (x + c)(x + d) = x\u00b2 + (c + d)x + cd. So for each monic quadratic, check if there exist c, d \u2208 Z_3 such that c + d \u2261 a and cd \u2261 b.\n\nFor our specific case, the polynomial is x\u00b2 + 1 (when c = 1). So a = 0, b = 1. So we need c + d \u2261 0 and cd \u2261 1. As before, this leads to c = -d, so substituting into cd \u2261 1 gives -c\u00b2 \u2261 1 \u21d2 c\u00b2 \u2261 -1 \u2261 2. But squares in Z_3 are 0 and 1, so no solution. Therefore, x\u00b2 +1 is irreducible.\n\nSimilarly, for c = 2, the polynomial is x\u00b2 + 2. Let's check reducibility. So x\u00b2 + 2 = x\u00b2 + 0x + 2. So a = 0, b = 2. Then c + d \u2261 0, cd \u2261 2. Then c = -d, so substituting into cd \u2261 2 gives -c\u00b2 \u2261 2 \u21d2 c\u00b2 \u2261 -2 \u2261 1 mod 3. So c\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 3. Solutions are c = 1 or c = 2. Therefore, c = 1 \u21d2 d = -1 = 2, and c = 2 \u21d2 d = -2 = 1. Then cd = 1*2 = 2 \u2261 2 mod 3. Therefore, yes, x\u00b2 + 2 factors as (x + 1)(x + 2). Therefore, reducible.\n\nTherefore, confirming again that c = 1 is the only value where x\u00b2 + c is irreducible. Therefore, the answer is c = 1.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, in Z_3, 2 is equivalent to -1. So x\u00b2 + 2 is equivalent to x\u00b2 - 1. And x\u00b2 - 1 factors as (x - 1)(x + 1) in any ring. So indeed, x\u00b2 - 1 factors, which is the same as x\u00b2 + 2 in Z_3. So that's reducible.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + 1 is x\u00b2 + 1, which doesn't factor as a difference of squares or anything. Since in Z_3, there's no element whose square is -1, which would be 2. So x\u00b2 + 1 is irreducible.\n\nTherefore, yes, only c = 1.\n\nBut wait, another angle: The quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 + c) has 3^2 = 9 elements. A finite ring with no zero divisors is a field. So if the quotient ring is a domain, then it's a field. So another way to check is whether x\u00b2 + c is irreducible, which we've done.\n\nAlternatively, if the polynomial is reducible, then the quotient ring has zero divisors and hence isn't a domain. Therefore, only when the polynomial is irreducible is the quotient ring a field.\n\nTherefore, conclusion remains c = 1.\n\nBut let me check for c = 0. Then the polynomial is x\u00b2, and the quotient ring is Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2). In this ring, x\u00b2 = 0, so x is a zero divisor. Therefore, not a domain, hence not a field. Correct.\n\nTherefore, yes, only c = 1.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. For c = 1, the polynomial is x\u00b2 + 1. Let me see if plugging in x = 0, 1, 2 gives us a root.\n\n- For x = 0: 0 + 1 = 1 \u2260 0 mod 3\n- For x = 1: 1 + 1 = 2 \u2260 0 mod 3\n- For x = 2: 4 + 1 = 5 \u2261 2 \u2260 0 mod 3\n\nSo no roots, hence irreducible. Therefore, quotient is a field.\n\nFor c = 2, x\u00b2 + 2:\n\n- x = 0: 0 + 2 = 2 \u2260 0\n- x = 1: 1 + 2 = 3 \u2261 0 mod 3. Wait, hold on! x = 1: 1\u00b2 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \u2261 0 mod 3. So x = 1 is a root. Therefore, x - 1 is a factor. Similarly, x = 2: 4 + 2 = 6 \u2261 0 mod 3. So x = 2 is also a root. Therefore, x\u00b2 + 2 factors as (x - 1)(x - 2) in Z_3[x]. Which is the same as (x + 2)(x + 1) since -1 \u2261 2 and -2 \u2261 1 in Z_3. Therefore, yes, reducible. Therefore, quotient ring isn't a field.\n\nBut wait, earlier when c = 2, I thought x\u00b2 + 2 had roots, but when c = 1, x\u00b2 +1 doesn't. So that's consistent.\n\nBut here's a confusion: when c = 2, x\u00b2 + 2 has roots x = 1 and x = 2. Therefore, reducible. When c = 1, x\u00b2 +1 has no roots, hence irreducible. When c = 0, x\u00b2 has a double root at 0, reducible. Therefore, only c =1.\n\nBut wait, hold on! Wait, when c = 2, x\u00b2 + 2 \u2261 x\u00b2 -1 mod 3, which factors as (x -1)(x +1). So that's reducible. Therefore, correct.\n\nBut here's another thought: maybe even if a polynomial has no roots, it could still be reducible? But for degree 2 polynomials over a field, if it factors, it must have a root. Because if a quadratic polynomial factors into two linear terms, then it has roots. If it factors into a product of a linear and a constant, but since it's monic, the constants would have to be 1. Wait, no. In a field, any non-constant polynomial can be factored into monic polynomials times constants. But since we're dealing with monic polynomials, if it's reducible, it must factor into monic linear terms. Therefore, a quadratic polynomial over a field is reducible if and only if it has a root in the field. Therefore, for quadratics, checking for roots is sufficient to determine reducibility.\n\nTherefore, since x\u00b2 + c is a quadratic polynomial, if it has no roots in Z_3, then it's irreducible, and hence the quotient is a field. If it has roots, it's reducible, and the quotient isn't a field.\n\nTherefore, for c = 0: x\u00b2 = 0 has root 0. Reducible.\n\nc =1: x\u00b2 +1 has no roots. Irreducible.\n\nc =2: x\u00b2 +2 has roots 1 and 2. Reducible.\n\nTherefore, only c =1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is c =1.\n\nBut let me check once more for c =1. Let's try to construct the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 +1). Since x\u00b2 +1 is irreducible, this should be a field extension of Z_3 of degree 2, hence with 9 elements. In this field, x\u00b2 = -1 = 2. So every element can be written as a + bx where a, b \u2208 Z_3. Addition is component-wise, and multiplication is done modulo x\u00b2 +1. For example, (a + bx)(c + dx) = ac + (ad + bc)x + bdx\u00b2. But x\u00b2 = 2, so this becomes ac + 2bd + (ad + bc)x. Therefore, closed under multiplication, and since it's a field, every non-zero element has an inverse.\n\nTherefore, yes, this is a field. Therefore, c =1 is correct.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I'm confident that the only c is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( c \\) is \\boxed{1}."
