        "question": "A model airplane flies slower when flying into the wind and faster with wind at its back. When launched at right angles to the wind a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is",
        "response": "Okay, so there's this question about a model airplane and how its groundspeed changes when there's a crosswind compared to flying in still air. Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that when an airplane is flying into the wind (headwind) or with the wind (tailwind), its groundspeed changes. If it's going against the wind, the groundspeed is the airplane's airspeed minus the wind speed, and if it's going with the wind, it's the airspeed plus the wind speed. But this question is about a crosswind, which is perpendicular to the direction the airplane is flying. Hmm, so how does that affect the groundspeed?\n\nLet me visualize this. If the airplane is flying at a right angle to the wind, the wind is blowing sideways relative to the airplane's direction. So, the wind isn't directly helping or hindering the airplane's forward motion, but it's pushing it sideways. But the question is about groundspeed, which is the actual speed over the ground. Wait, groundspeed is the vector combination of the airplane's airspeed and the wind speed. So, in this case, since the wind is perpendicular, we have to consider the vector addition of these two velocities.\n\nLet me recall that when two vectors are perpendicular, the magnitude of the resultant vector can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. So, if the airplane's airspeed is, say, v, and the wind speed is w, then the groundspeed would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides v and w. Therefore, the groundspeed would be sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2). But wait, that would mean the groundspeed is actually higher than the airspeed. But the question says \"compared with flying in still air.\" In still air, the groundspeed would just be equal to the airspeed, right? Because there's no wind affecting it.\n\nSo, if in crosswind, the groundspeed is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is greater than v. But that seems counterintuitive. If the wind is blowing sideways, wouldn't the groundspeed just be the same as the airspeed? Because the wind isn't pushing it forward or backward. Wait, no. Because groundspeed is the actual path over the ground. If the airplane is trying to fly perpendicular to the wind, but the wind is pushing it sideways, then relative to the ground, the airplane's path would be a combination of its own motion and the wind's motion. So, the resultant path would be diagonal, and the speed along that diagonal path would be the groundspeed.\n\nBut wait, if the airplane is maintaining its heading perpendicular to the wind, then to an observer on the ground, the airplane would be moving both in the direction it's pointing and also being carried downwind. So, the groundspeed vector would have two components: one from the airplane's airspeed and one from the wind. Therefore, the magnitude of the groundspeed would indeed be sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is higher than the airspeed. But that seems like the groundspeed is actually increased compared to still air. But the question is phrased as \"its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is...\" So, maybe the answer is that the groundspeed is the same? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing airspeed and groundspeed. The airplane's airspeed is its speed relative to the air. So, if there's a crosswind, the airplane's direction relative to the air is perpendicular, but the air itself is moving relative to the ground. So, the groundspeed is the vector sum of the airplane's velocity relative to the air and the air's velocity relative to the ground. Therefore, if the airplane is flying perpendicular to the wind, its groundspeed vector would be the combination of its own airspeed vector (perpendicular to the wind) and the wind vector. So, for example, if the wind is blowing to the east, and the airplane is flying north, then the groundspeed would be a vector pointing northeast, with the north component equal to the airplane's airspeed and the east component equal to the wind speed. The magnitude of that groundspeed vector would be sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is greater than the airspeed v. Therefore, the groundspeed is higher than the airspeed. But compared to flying in still air, where groundspeed equals airspeed, the groundspeed in crosswind is higher. Wait, but the question says \"compared with flying in still air is...\" So, if in still air, groundspeed is equal to airspeed, and in crosswind, groundspeed is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is higher. Therefore, the answer would be that the groundspeed is higher. But I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is trying to trick me. Let me think again. Suppose the airplane is flying in a crosswind, but to maintain a straight path over the ground (i.e., not being blown sideways), the pilot would have to head partially into the wind. In that case, the groundspeed would be less than the airspeed because some of the airspeed is used to counteract the wind drift. But the question says \"when launched at right angles to the wind,\" so the heading is perpendicular to the wind, not adjusting for the wind. Therefore, the airplane's path over the ground would be a diagonal, and the groundspeed would be higher. So, in that case, compared to still air, the groundspeed is higher. But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the component of the groundspeed in the original direction. Wait, no, groundspeed is the actual speed over the ground, regardless of direction. So, if the airplane is flying perpendicular to the wind, and the wind is blowing perpendicular to the airplane's heading, then the groundspeed vector's magnitude is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is greater than v. Therefore, the groundspeed is greater than in still air. Therefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is higher. But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the airplane's airspeed is 10 m/s, and the wind speed is 5 m/s. In still air, groundspeed is 10 m/s. In crosswind, groundspeed would be sqrt(10\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) = sqrt(125) \u2248 11.18 m/s. So, yes, higher. Therefore, the answer should be that the groundspeed is higher. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when people talk about crosswind, they might be considering the effective speed in the intended direction. But in this case, the question specifically says \"groundspeed,\" which is the actual speed over the ground, regardless of direction. So, even though the airplane is being blown off course, the groundspeed is the magnitude of the resultant vector, which is higher. Therefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is higher compared to flying in still air.\n\nBut wait, let me check another perspective. Suppose the airplane is flying in a crosswind, but the pilot wants to fly a straight path over the ground. In that case, the pilot would have to head into the wind at an angle, so that the wind's effect is canceled out. In that scenario, the groundspeed in the desired direction would be less than the airspeed. But the question says \"launched at right angles to the wind,\" so the heading is perpendicular, not adjusted. Therefore, the groundspeed is the vector sum, which is higher. Therefore, the answer is higher. \n\nHmm, but maybe the answer is the same? Wait, no. If there's a crosswind, and the airplane is flying perpendicular to it, then relative to the ground, it's moving both in the direction it's pointing and being pushed by the wind. So, the speed over the ground is higher. Therefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is higher. \n\nBut let me check another example. If the wind is blowing east at 3 m/s and the airplane is flying north at 4 m/s airspeed, then the groundspeed would be 5 m/s (sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2)=5). So, 5 m/s groundspeed compared to 4 m/s in still air. Therefore, higher. So, yes, the groundspeed is higher. Therefore, the answer should be that the groundspeed is higher when flying in a crosswind compared to still air. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"a cross wind its groundspeed compared with flying in still air is...\" So, the answer is that the groundspeed is greater. Therefore, the answer is higher or increased. But the options might be different, but since the user hasn't provided options, I need to state the answer. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The airplane's airspeed is the same, right? Whether in still air or in wind. So, in still air, the groundspeed equals airspeed. In crosswind, the groundspeed is the vector sum, which is higher. Therefore, the groundspeed is higher. Therefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is higher than in still air. \n\nBut let me check another source. For example, when a plane flies in a crosswind, its groundspeed is indeed the vector sum of its airspeed and the wind speed. If they are perpendicular, then the magnitude is sqrt(v\u00b2 + w\u00b2), which is greater than v. Therefore, the groundspeed is greater. So, the answer should be that the groundspeed is higher. \n\nTherefore, the answer is that the groundspeed is higher compared to flying in still air. So, the correct answer is that the groundspeed is greater when there's a crosswind."
