        "question": "A previously healthy 32-year-old woman comes to the physician 8 months after her husband was killed in a car crash. Since that time, she has had a decreased appetite and difficulty falling asleep. She states that she is often sad and cries frequently. She has been rechecking the door lock five times before leaving her house and has to count exactly five pieces of toilet paper before she uses it. She says that she has always been a perfectionist but these urges and rituals are new. Pharmacotherapy should be targeted to which of the following neurotransmitters?",
        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, we have a 32-year-old woman who's been having issues since her husband died eight months ago. Her symptoms include decreased appetite, trouble sleeping, sadness, frequent crying, and some new compulsions like checking the door lock five times and counting toilet paper pieces. She mentions she's always been a perfectionist, but these specific rituals are new. The question is asking which neurotransmitter's pharmacotherapy should target.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what diagnosis we're dealing with here. The patient is presenting with symptoms of depression: decreased appetite, insomnia, sadness, crying. Those are classic signs of major depressive disorder. But there's also the presence of new-onset obsessive-compulsive behaviors\u2014checking the lock multiple times and counting toilet paper. That makes me think of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, OCD typically has a more chronic course, and she says these are new since her husband's death.\n\nWait, but OCD can be triggered by stressful events. Also, the fact that she's a perfectionist might be a personality trait, but the actual compulsions are new. So maybe she has both depression and OCD? Or is this a case of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood? But the compulsions are more specific to OCD. Alternatively, could this be a grief reaction that's complicated and presenting with OCD symptoms?\n\nIn terms of neurotransmitters, depression is usually associated with serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. OCD is primarily linked to serotonin as well. The first-line treatment for OCD is SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), which increase serotonin levels. For depression, SSRIs are also commonly used. So if she has both, an SSRI might address both conditions. But the question is specifically asking which neurotransmitter to target. The options would likely be serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, GABA, or maybe others.\n\nGiven that OCD is strongly associated with serotonin, and her new compulsions suggest OCD, even if it's comorbid with depression, the main target here would be serotonin. The perfectionism might be a personality trait, but the rituals are new and likely part of OCD. So pharmacotherapy should target serotonin. Therefore, the answer is serotonin."
