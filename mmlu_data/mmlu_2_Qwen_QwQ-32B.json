        "question": "Statement 1 | Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group. Statement 2 | The symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements.",
        "response": "Okay, let me try to figure out these two statements about group theory. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nStarting with Statement 1: \"Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group.\" Hmm, I remember that a cyclic subgroup generated by an element 'a' is all the powers of 'a', right? Like {a^n | n is an integer}. So if you take any element in a group, even if the group itself isn't cyclic, the element should still form its own cyclic subgroup. Let me think of an example. Take the group S_3, which isn't cyclic because it's non-abelian and has order 6, which isn't prime. But if I pick an element like (1 2), the cyclic subgroup it generates is {(1), (1 2)}, which is indeed a subgroup. Similarly, the element (1 2 3) would generate a subgroup of order 3. So yeah, every element does generate a cyclic subgroup. So Statement 1 seems true.\n\nNow Statement 2: \"The symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements.\" Wait, the symmetric group S_n is the group of all permutations of n elements. The order of S_n is n factorial, right? So S_10 should have 10! elements. Let me confirm. For example, S_3 has 6 elements (3!), S_4 has 24, so S_10 would be 10\u00d79\u00d78\u00d7...\u00d71. That's way more than 10. So Statement 2 must be false. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the question? Could \"symmetric group S_10\" refer to something else? No, I think S_n is standard notation for the symmetric group on n symbols. So 10 elements would only be true if n=10, but the order is 10 factorial. Therefore Statement 2 is definitely false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse symmetric groups with something else. Like, maybe cyclic groups? But the question says symmetric group. So yeah, I think my reasoning holds. So Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false.\n\nBut hold on, maybe there's a trick in Statement 1? Like, does every element generate a cyclic subgroup, even the identity? Well, the cyclic subgroup generated by the identity is just {e}, which is trivial but still a subgroup. And for other elements, as I thought before, their powers will form a cyclic subgroup. So yeah, even the identity works. So Statement 1 is definitely true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.\n\n**Final Answer**\nStatement 1: \\boxed{True}, Statement 2: \\boxed{False}\n</think>\n\nStatement 1: \"Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group.\" \n\nTo verify this, recall that the cyclic subgroup generated by an element \\(a\\) in a group is the set \\(\\{a^n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\). For any element in a group, this set forms a subgroup. For example, in the symmetric group \\(S_3\\), the element \\((1 2)\\) generates the subgroup \\(\\{(1), (1 2)\\}\\), and the element \\((1 2 3)\\) generates a subgroup of order 3. Even the identity element generates the trivial subgroup \\(\\{e\\}\\). Therefore, every element indeed generates a cyclic subgroup. Hence, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"The symmetric group \\(S_{10}\\) has 10 elements.\"\n\nThe symmetric group \\(S_n\\) consists of all permutations of \\(n\\) elements, and its order is \\(n!\\). For \\(S_{10}\\), the order is \\(10!\\), which is \\(10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times \\cdots \\times 1\\), a much larger number than 10. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\n### Final Answer\nStatement 1: \\boxed{True}, Statement 2: \\boxed{False}"
