        "response": "Uncertainty over the limits to presidential power is caused primarily by the fact that the U.S. Constitution provides a broad framework for executive authority but leaves many specifics open to interpretation. This ambiguity has led to ongoing debates and legal challenges about the extent of presidential powers, particularly in areas such as executive orders, war powers, emergency actions, and the enforcement of laws. Additionally, the balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is dynamic and has evolved over time, often influenced by historical circumstances, political dynamics, and judicial rulings. As a result, the boundaries of presidential power are not always clearly defined, leading to uncertainty and contention."
