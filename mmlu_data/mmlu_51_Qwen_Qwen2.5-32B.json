        "response": "The increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the heat added to the gas in an isochoric process, where the volume of the gas remains constant. In this process, the heat added to the gas is entirely used to increase the internal energy of the gas, as no work is done by the gas on its surroundings."
