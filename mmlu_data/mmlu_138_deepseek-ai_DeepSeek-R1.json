        "question": "A microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the rate at which energy is being used by the microwave oven. The problem says the microwave is connected to a 120 V outlet and draws 2 amps. Hmm, energy usage over time is power, right? So they're asking for the power consumption of the microwave. \n\nPower in electrical terms... I remember there's a formula that relates power (P), voltage (V), and current (I). Let me think. Oh yeah, P = V * I. That's the basic power formula. So if the voltage is 120 volts and the current is 2 amps, then multiplying them should give the power. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up any formulas. There's also P = I\u00b2R or P = V\u00b2/R, but those are when you have resistance involved. But here, we don't have the resistance given. So probably the simplest one is P = V * I. \n\nLet me verify. Voltage is in volts, current in amps, and power in watts. Volts times amps equals watts. Yeah, that sounds right. For example, a 120 V device drawing 1 A would use 120 W. So here, 2 A would be 240 W. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any catch here. Is the microwave purely resistive? Because some devices might have reactive components, like inductive loads, which can affect the power calculation. But in most cases, for household appliances, especially something like a microwave which uses a magnetron (which I think is an inductive load), the power factor might come into play. \n\nHmm, power factor is the ratio of real power to apparent power. If the power factor is less than 1, then the real power (which is what we pay for) is less than the product of voltage and current. But the problem doesn't mention anything about power factor. Since it's a basic problem, maybe they expect us to assume that the power factor is 1, meaning it's a purely resistive load. \n\nBut wait, microwave ovens typically have a power factor less than 1 because of the inductive components. However, in introductory physics problems, unless specified, they usually ignore the power factor and just use P = V * I. So maybe I should go with that here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the rate of energy usage as the apparent power rather than real power. But energy usage typically refers to real power, which is what's actually consumed and converted into heat or work. But again, without knowing the power factor, we can't calculate the real power. \n\nGiven that the problem is probably intended for a basic level, I think they expect the answer to be simply 120 V multiplied by 2 A, which is 240 watts. \n\nLet me just recap. Power (P) equals voltage (V) multiplied by current (I). So P = 120 V * 2 A = 240 W. Therefore, the rate at which energy is being used is 240 watts. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with another formula. If I had resistance, R, then V = I * R, so R = V / I = 120 / 2 = 60 ohms. Then power can also be calculated as P = I\u00b2 * R = (2)^2 * 60 = 4 * 60 = 240 W. Same result. Alternatively, P = V\u00b2 / R = (120)^2 / 60 = 14400 / 60 = 240 W. So regardless of the formula, it's 240 W. \n\nSo even if we consider resistance, we still get the same answer. Therefore, even if there's a reactive component, since the problem doesn't mention power factor or phase angles, the answer is 240 watts. \n\nTherefore, the rate at which energy is being used by the microwave oven is 240 watts.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe rate at which energy is being used by the microwave oven is \\boxed{240} watts."
