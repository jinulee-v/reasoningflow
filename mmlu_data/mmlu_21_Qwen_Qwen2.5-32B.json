        "question": "What is the difference between a male and a female catheter?",
        "response": "Male and female catheters are designed to accommodate the anatomical differences between men and women. Male catheters are typically longer and have a curved tip, which is designed to navigate the male urethra, which is longer and has a natural curve. Female catheters are shorter and have a straight tip, which is designed to accommodate the shorter and straighter female urethra. Additionally, female catheters often have a wider diameter to make insertion easier. Both types of catheters are designed to be used for the same purpose, which is to drain urine from the bladder when a person is unable to do so on their own."
