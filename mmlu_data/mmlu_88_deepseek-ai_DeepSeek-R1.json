        "question": "As of 2019, about what percentage of Russians say it is very important to have free media in our country without government/state censorship?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find out what percentage of Russians, as of 2019, said it's very important to have free media without government or state censorship. Let me start by recalling any information I might have on this topic. I remember that Russia has strict media controls, and the government has significant influence over major media outlets. However, public opinion might vary.\n\nFirst, I should think about reputable sources that conduct surveys in Russia. Organizations like the Levada Center, which is a Russian non-governmental research organization, often conduct polls on social and political issues. They might have data on this. Also, international organizations like Pew Research Center or Freedom House might have conducted relevant surveys.\n\nI should check if there were any specific surveys around 2019. Let me think. In 2019, there were ongoing discussions about media freedom in Russia, especially with laws regarding \"fake news\" and internet sovereignty. But public opinion on the matter might not be widely reported in Western media. \n\nI recall a Pew Research report from around 2019 that covered global attitudes toward various issues, including media freedom. Let me try to remember if that included Russia. Alternatively, the Levada Center's website (if accessible) would have the most accurate data. However, accessing their reports might require specific searches, which I can't do right now. \n\nAnother angle: in 2019, the Russian government passed more restrictive internet laws, which might have influenced public opinion. But does that mean people supported more freedom or were they in favor of government control? It's possible that due to propaganda, some Russians might support government oversight, while others desire free media.\n\nWait, there was a survey mentioned in a 2019 article by Meduza, an independent Russian-language news outlet. They sometimes cite Levada Center polls. If I remember correctly, Meduza reported that around 30% of Russians considered free media very important. But I'm not sure about the exact figure. Alternatively, maybe it's higher. \n\nWait, another thought. The World Values Survey might have data on this. They conduct global surveys about values, including attitudes toward democracy and freedom. Checking their 2017-2020 wave might include Russia. However, I don't have the exact numbers. \n\nAlternatively, reports from organizations like Reporters Without Borders might cite public opinion data, but they usually focus on the state of media freedom rather than public opinion. \n\nI think the Levada Center did a survey in 2019 where they asked about the importance of media freedom. If I recall correctly, the percentage was around 30-40%. Let me try to piece this together. In 2018, there was a Levada poll where 22% said free media was very important, and 37% somewhat important. But that's 2018. Did it change in 2019? Maybe not drastically. \n\nAlternatively, another angle: in March 2019, there was a Levada Center poll that found that 47% of Russians believed the media should be under state control, while 42% supported independent media. However, this is about state control vs. independence, not exactly the same as \"very important to have free media without censorship.\" But perhaps the numbers are related. If 42% support independent media, maybe the percentage who say it's \"very important\" is lower, as some might support it but not see it as very important. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question was phrased differently. For example, a 2019 poll might ask, \"How important is it for Russia to have media free from state censorship?\" with options like very important, somewhat important, etc. If the answer was 35% very important, that could be the figure. \n\nWait, I found a reference in my memory from a previous study: in 2019, the Levada Center reported that 32% of Russians considered having free media without censorship very important. Another 45% said it was somewhat important. So the answer would be 32%. But I need to confirm this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number is higher. Let me think again. If 42% support independent media, perhaps the \"very important\" is around that. But I think the exact figure was lower. \n\nAnother possibility: the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published a report in 2020 citing that 22% of Russians prioritize free speech as a key democratic attribute. But that's a different metric. \n\nWait, perhaps the actual figure is around 22-35%. Given conflicting memories, I need to settle on the most probable number. If Levada Center's data from 2019 is around 32%, that's plausible. Alternatively, maybe 22% as in previous years. \n\nAlternatively, checking another source: Freedom House's Freedom in the World 2020 report on Russia mentions that only 16% of Russians trust the media, but that's trust, not the importance of free media. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 32%. I think I've read that before. So, putting it all together, the most probable answer is that around 32% of Russians in 2019 said it's very important to have free media without government censorship. But I need to be cautious here. If I can't recall exactly, maybe I should present a range. However, the user asks for a specific percentage. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: in 2021, a Levada poll showed that 25% considered freedom of speech very important. But that's 2021. In 2019, maybe similar. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm conflating different surveys. Let me try to structure this:\n\n1. Identify the source: Likely Levada Center.\n2. Check the year: 2019.\n3. Find the exact question: Importance of free media without state censorship.\n4. Recall the percentage: If I remember correctly, around 30-35%.\n\nAlternatively, if I can't recall exactly, perhaps state that according to the Levada Center in 2019, approximately 32% of Russians considered it very important to have free media without state censorship. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 22% as per a 2018 poll, but the user specified 2019. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, but needing to provide an answer, I'll go with 32% as the approximate figure from 2019."
