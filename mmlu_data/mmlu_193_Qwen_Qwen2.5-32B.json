        "question": "What characteristic is not a key feature of the 'open systems' model of management?",
        "response": "The 'open systems' model of management is characterized by its focus on the interdependence of various components within an organization and its environment. It emphasizes the importance of adaptability, flexibility, and responsiveness to external changes. However, one characteristic that is not a key feature of the 'open systems' model of management is the emphasis on strict hierarchical structures and rigid organizational boundaries. The 'open systems' model encourages a more fluid and dynamic approach to management, where the boundaries between different parts of the organization and its environment are more permeable, allowing for greater exchange of information, resources, and ideas. This approach is in contrast to more traditional management models that emphasize a more rigid and hierarchical structure, with clear boundaries between different parts of the organization."
