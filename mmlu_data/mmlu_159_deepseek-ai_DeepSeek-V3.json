        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck.\"\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Cambridge University Press.\nAlfred Crosby, historian, Ecological Imperialism, 2004\nThe \"quantum jump\" mentioned in the passage most directly contributed to which of the following developments in the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.?",
        "response": "The \"quantum jump\" mentioned in the passage refers to a significant increase in productivity and technological advancement that allowed Western Europe to achieve global hegemony. This leap was made possible by exploiting ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets from other continents, facilitated by European colonization and imperialism.\n\nIn the period 1450\u20131750 C.E., this \"quantum jump\" most directly contributed to the **rise of European colonial empires**. During this time, European powers such as Spain, Portugal, Britain, France, and the Netherlands established vast overseas colonies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. These colonies provided raw materials, labor (including enslaved people), and new markets, which fueled Europe's economic growth, technological innovation, and military dominance. This period also saw the **Columbian Exchange**, which transformed global agriculture, diets, and ecosystems, further consolidating European power. \n\nThus, the \"quantum jump\" enabled the expansion of European colonial empires and the establishment of a global economic system centered on European dominance."
