        "question": "Judge took judicial notice of some facts at the beginning of the trial. Which of the following is not an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice?",
        "response": "Judicial notice is a legal doctrine that allows a court to accept the truth of a particular fact without requiring formal evidence to prove it. There are certain types of facts that are generally considered appropriate for judicial notice, such as facts that are widely known, indisputable, or capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. However, there are also some types of facts that are not appropriate for judicial notice. One example of an inappropriate type of fact for judicial notice is a fact that is subject to reasonable dispute or controversy. Such facts require the presentation of evidence and the opportunity for cross-examination in order to establish their truth. Another example of an inappropriate type of fact for judicial notice is a fact that is not within the common knowledge of the court or the parties. Such facts require the presentation of expert testimony or other specialized evidence in order to establish their truth. Finally, a fact that is not relevant to the issues in the case is also not appropriate for judicial notice. Such facts are not necessary to the resolution of the case and therefore do not require the court's attention."
