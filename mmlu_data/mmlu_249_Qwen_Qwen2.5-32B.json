        "question": "A 22-year-old male marathon runner presents to the office with the complaint of right-sided rib pain when he runs long distances. Physical examination reveals normal heart and lung findings and an exhalation dysfunction at ribs\u00a04-5 on the right. Which of the following muscles or muscle groups will be most useful in correcting this dysfunction utilizing a direct method?",
        "response": "The most useful muscle or muscle group to correct this dysfunction utilizing a direct method would be the internal intercostal muscles. These muscles are responsible for the exhalation process and are located between the ribs. Strengthening these muscles can help improve the exhalation dysfunction at ribs 4-5 on the right side."
