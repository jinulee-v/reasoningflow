        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following provides the best context for Nkrumah's writings?",
        "response": "Kwame Nkrumah's writings in *Neo-Colonialism* (1965) are best understood in the context of the **post-colonial struggle for economic and political independence in Africa and other developing nations during the mid-20th century**. Specifically, Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana and a prominent Pan-Africanist, was addressing the challenges faced by newly independent states in maintaining sovereignty and self-determination in a world dominated by former colonial powers and Cold War superpowers.\n\n### Key Contextual Factors:\n1. **Decolonization**: In the decades following World War II, many African and Asian nations gained independence from European colonial powers. However, these countries often found themselves economically dependent on their former colonizers or other developed nations, leading to concerns about *neo-colonialism*\u2014a form of indirect control through economic, political, and cultural influence.\n\n2. **Cold War Dynamics**: The Cold War rivalry between the United States (capitalist bloc) and the Soviet Union (socialist bloc) created a global environment where newly independent nations were often pressured to align with one side. Nkrumah advocated for *non-alignment*, a policy of neutrality and cooperation with all states, to avoid becoming entangled in this ideological struggle and to preserve national sovereignty.\n\n3. **Economic Exploitation**: Nkrumah criticized the economic practices of developed nations, which he believed exploited less developed countries by extracting resources and profits without fostering sustainable development. He emphasized the need for foreign investment to align with national development plans rather than serving the interests of foreign capitalists.\n\n4. **Pan-Africanism**: Nkrumah was a leading figure in the Pan-African movement, which sought unity and solidarity among African nations to resist external domination and promote collective self-reliance. His writings reflect this broader vision of African independence and cooperation.\n\nIn summary, Nkrumah's writings are rooted in the struggle of post-colonial states to achieve true independence and resist neo-colonial exploitation, while navigating the complexities of the Cold War and advocating for economic self-determination."
