        "question": "Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)",
        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the blinking intervals of the three lights. The LCM of 2, 3, and 5 is 30. This means that all three lights will blink simultaneously every 30 seconds. Since the dance lasts for seven minutes, or 420 seconds, we can divide 420 by 30 to find the number of times all three lights will blink simultaneously. 420 divided by 30 is 14, so all three lights will blink simultaneously 14 times during the dance, including the very beginning and very end of the dance."
