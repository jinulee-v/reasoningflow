        "question": "Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved? I. Conservation of linear momentum II. Zero net external force III. Zero net external torque",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given conditions ensure that angular momentum is conserved. The options are I, II, and III, which are Conservation of linear momentum, Zero net external force, and Zero net external torque. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about angular momentum and its conservation.\n\nFirst, angular momentum is a measure of the amount of rotation an object has, taking into account its mass, shape, and rotational speed. The conservation of angular momentum states that if there's no external torque acting on a system, the total angular momentum of that system remains constant. That sounds like condition III might be the one. But let me think through each option carefully.\n\nStarting with condition I: Conservation of linear momentum. I know that linear momentum is conserved when there's no external force acting on a system. But does the conservation of linear momentum directly imply the conservation of angular momentum? Maybe not necessarily. Because linear momentum deals with translational motion, while angular momentum is about rotational motion. They are related but distinct concepts. So even if linear momentum is conserved, angular momentum might not be, unless there's also something about torque. So maybe I can't rely on just condition I.\n\nCondition II: Zero net external force. If there's no net external force, then according to Newton's second law, the linear momentum of the system is conserved. That's condition I. But again, how does that relate to angular momentum? Well, torque is the rotational analog of force. Torque is the rate of change of angular momentum. So if there's no external torque, angular momentum is conserved. But a zero net external force would mean linear momentum is conserved, but does that ensure angular momentum is conserved? Let me think. Suppose there's no external force, but there could still be external torques if the forces are applied at a distance from the axis of rotation. Wait, but if there's no external force at all, then there can't be any external torque either, right? Because torque is force times the lever arm. If there's no force, then torque would also be zero. Hmm, so maybe if there's zero net external force, then both linear momentum and angular momentum are conserved? But that might not be entirely accurate. Let me check.\n\nSuppose you have a system where all external forces cancel out (so net force is zero), but the individual forces might create a torque. For example, imagine two forces acting on a rod, equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, but not along the same line. The net force is zero, so linear momentum is conserved, but the torque from these forces would cause rotation, so angular momentum would change unless the net torque is also zero. Wait, but in that case, even though the net force is zero, the net torque isn't zero. Therefore, angular momentum isn't conserved. So condition II (zero net external force) alone isn't sufficient to ensure angular momentum conservation. Because torque can still exist even with zero net force. Therefore, condition II isn't enough.\n\nCondition III: Zero net external torque. This is the standard condition for conservation of angular momentum. If there's no external torque, angular momentum remains constant. So that's definitely a valid condition. So III is correct.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the conditions will ensure angular momentum is conserved. So III is definitely one. What about the others?\n\nWait, but maybe if both I and II are true? Let me see. If linear momentum is conserved (I) and there's zero net external force (II), but as I saw earlier, even with II, angular momentum might not be conserved. So maybe only III is sufficient. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if linear momentum is conserved, does that somehow imply that angular momentum is conserved? Probably not. Because linear momentum conservation is about the total momentum vector, while angular momentum depends on the position vectors relative to the axis. So they are separate. So even if linear momentum is conserved, angular momentum can change if there's a torque. So I think only III is the correct condition here.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact wording of the question again: \"Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved?\" So it's possible that more than one condition can ensure it, but maybe only III is correct. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if there's zero net external force (II), then the torque is also zero? Wait, torque is the cross product of the position vector and the force. If the net force is zero, does that mean the net torque is also zero? Not necessarily. For example, imagine two forces acting on a rigid body, equal in magnitude and opposite, but applied at different points. The net force is zero, so linear momentum is conserved, but the torque from each force would add up because their lever arms are different. So the net torque would not be zero. Therefore, even with II, angular momentum can change. Therefore, II is insufficient.\n\nTherefore, only III is the correct condition. So the answer should be III only. But let me check if there's any other angle here.\n\nWait, the question says \"ensure that angular momentum is conserved\". So if III is true (zero net external torque), then angular momentum is conserved. That's the standard conservation law. So III is correct. The other conditions don't necessarily ensure it. So the answer is III.\n\nBut let me think again about condition I. If linear momentum is conserved, does that mean angular momentum is conserved? Suppose in a system where linear momentum is conserved, but there are internal torques. Wait, but internal torques don't affect the total angular momentum because they cancel out (Newton's third law in rotational form). So if there's no external torque, angular momentum is conserved. But if linear momentum is conserved, that just tells us about the forces, but not necessarily the torques. So even if linear momentum is conserved, if there's an external torque, angular momentum can change. Therefore, I is not sufficient.\n\nTherefore, only III is the correct answer. So the answer is option III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{III}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which conditions ensure the conservation of angular momentum, we analyze each given option:\n\n1. **Conservation of linear momentum (I):** Linear momentum conservation occurs when there is no net external force. However, angular momentum depends on rotational motion and torque. Even if linear momentum is conserved, angular momentum can still change if there is an external torque. Therefore, conservation of linear momentum alone does not ensure angular momentum conservation.\n\n2. **Zero net external force (II):** A zero net external force ensures linear momentum conservation. However, torque (the rotational analog of force) can still exist even if the net force is zero. For example, two equal and opposite forces applied at different points create a torque without a net force. Thus, angular momentum might not be conserved even with zero net external force.\n\n3. **Zero net external torque (III):** Angular momentum is conserved if there is no external torque. This is the fundamental condition for conservation of angular momentum. Internal torques cancel out due to Newton's third law, so only external torques affect the total angular momentum. Therefore, zero net external torque ensures angular momentum conservation.\n\nAfter evaluating all conditions, only condition III guarantees the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n\\boxed{III}"
