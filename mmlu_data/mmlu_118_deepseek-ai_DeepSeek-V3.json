Cabinet departments are executive agencies that assist the president in carrying out federal laws and policies.\n\n2. **There are currently 15 cabinet departments in the U.S. government.**  \n   - This is **true**. As of 2023, there are 15 cabinet-level departments, such as the Department of Defense, Department of Education, and Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n3. **Cabinet departments are headed by secretaries who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.**  \n   - This is **true**. Each cabinet department is led by a secretary, who is a member of the president's cabinet.\n\n4. **Cabinet departments are responsible for creating laws.**  \n   - This is **false**. Cabinet departments enforce and administer laws, but they do not create them. Laws are created by the legislative branch (Congress).\n\nThus, the **false statement** is:  \n**\"Cabinet departments are responsible for creating laws.\"**"
