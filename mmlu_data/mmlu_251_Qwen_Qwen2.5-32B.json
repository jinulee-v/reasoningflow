        "response": "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. It is a measure of central tendency that represents the most common value in a set of data. Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be used with both numerical and categorical data. In some cases, a dataset may have more than one mode, or no mode at all if all values appear with the same frequency."
