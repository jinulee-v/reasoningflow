        "response": "The most proactive approach to addressing negative or misleading information posted online about your organization is to monitor the internet for mentions of your organization, and respond to negative or misleading information promptly and professionally. This can include responding to comments on social media, writing blog posts or articles to clarify the facts, and reaching out to the original poster to request that they correct the information. It is also important to have a clear and consistent message that you can use to respond to negative or misleading information, and to be prepared to provide evidence to support your claims. Additionally, it can be helpful to have a team of people who are responsible for monitoring and responding to online mentions of your organization, so that you can ensure that all negative or misleading information is addressed in a timely and effective manner."
