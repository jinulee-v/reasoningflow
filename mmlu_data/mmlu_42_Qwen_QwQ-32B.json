        "question": "Let A be a real 2x2 matrix. Which of the following statements must be true?\r\nI. All of the entries of A^2 are nonnegative.\r\nII. The determinant of A^2 is nonnegative.\r\nIII. If A has two distinct eigenvalues, then A^2 has two distinct eigenvalues.",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this question here about a real 2x2 matrix A, and I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true. Let me go through each one step by step. \n\nStarting with statement I: \"All of the entries of A\u00b2 are nonnegative.\" Hmm, I need to think if this is necessarily true for any real 2x2 matrix. Let me consider some examples. \n\nFirst, take a simple matrix where all entries are positive. Let's say A is the identity matrix [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. Then A\u00b2 is also the identity matrix, so all entries are 1 and 0, which are nonnegative. That works. \n\nBut what if A has some negative entries? Let me try a matrix with a negative entry. Suppose A is [[1, -1], [-1, 1]]. Then A squared would be [[1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1), 1*(-1) + (-1)*1], [(-1)*1 + 1*(-1), (-1)*(-1) + 1*1]]. Wait, let me compute that properly. \n\nFirst entry (1,1): (1)(1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nEntry (1,2): (1)(-1) + (-1)(1) = -1 -1 = -2. \n\nEntry (2,1): (-1)(1) + (1)(-1) = -1 -1 = -2. \n\nEntry (2,2): (-1)(-1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nSo A squared here is [[2, -2], [-2, 2]]. Oh, so the off-diagonal entries are negative. That means statement I is not necessarily true because here A\u00b2 has negative entries. So I can already see that statement I is false. \n\nAlright, moving on to statement II: \"The determinant of A\u00b2 is nonnegative.\" Hmm, determinant of A squared. Let me recall that determinant of A squared is (determinant of A) squared. Since determinant of A is a real number, squaring it would make it nonnegative. \n\nWait, that seems right. Because det(A\u00b2) = det(A)^2. Since squaring any real number gives a nonnegative result, this determinant must be nonnegative. So statement II must be true. Let me verify with an example. \n\nTake the previous matrix A = [[1, -1], [-1, 1]]. The determinant of A is (1)(1) - (-1)(-1) = 1 - 1 = 0. Then determinant of A squared is 0 squared, which is 0, which is nonnegative. \n\nAnother example: Let A be [[2, 0], [0, 3]]. Then determinant of A is 6, so determinant of A squared is 36, which is positive. \n\nWhat if determinant of A is negative? Let's say A is [[-1, 0], [0, -1]]. Then determinant of A is (-1)(-1) = 1, so determinant squared is still 1. Wait, actually determinant of A here is 1, so determinant squared is 1. Wait, but if A had determinant -2, then determinant squared would be 4. Wait, but determinant of a real matrix can be negative, but when you square it, it becomes positive. \n\nWait, actually, determinant of A can be any real number, positive or negative, but determinant squared is always non-negative. So yes, statement II must be true. \n\nOkay, so II is true. \n\nNow statement III: \"If A has two distinct eigenvalues, then A\u00b2 has two distinct eigenvalues.\" Hmm. Let me think. \n\nSuppose A has two distinct eigenvalues, say \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082. Then the eigenvalues of A\u00b2 would be \u03bb\u2081\u00b2 and \u03bb\u2082\u00b2. The question is, can \u03bb\u2081\u00b2 and \u03bb\u2082\u00b2 be equal even if \u03bb\u2081 and \u03bb\u2082 are distinct? \n\nYes, if \u03bb\u2082 = -\u03bb\u2081. For example, suppose \u03bb\u2081 = 1 and \u03bb\u2082 = -1. Then their squares are both 1, so A\u00b2 would have a repeated eigenvalue of 1. \n\nTherefore, in this case, even though A has two distinct eigenvalues, A\u00b2 would have only one distinct eigenvalue (with multiplicity 2). Therefore, statement III is not necessarily true. \n\nLet me test with a concrete example. Let me take a matrix with eigenvalues 1 and -1. Let's pick a diagonal matrix A = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. Then A squared is [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which has eigenvalue 1 with multiplicity 2. So indeed, A\u00b2 has only one distinct eigenvalue. \n\nTherefore, statement III is false. \n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nI: False (we found a counterexample where A\u00b2 has negative entries)\n\nII: True (since determinant of A squared is (det A)^2 which is non-negative)\n\nIII: False (since eigenvalues can become equal when squared)\n\nTherefore, the answer should be only statement II must be true.\n\nWait, but let me check another example for III to be thorough. Suppose A has eigenvalues 2 and 3. Then A\u00b2 would have eigenvalues 4 and 9, which are distinct. So in that case, it's okay. But if eigenvalues are like 1 and -1, then their squares coincide. So since the question is about \"must be true\", since there exists a case where it's not true, then III is not necessarily true. \n\nAnother angle: suppose A has eigenvalues that are complex? Wait, but the question says A is a real matrix. So eigenvalues could be complex conjugates. But if they are complex and distinct, then their squares would also be complex conjugates? Let me see. Suppose eigenvalues are a+bi and a\u2212bi. Then their squares would be (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 2abi) and (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - 2abi). So those are still distinct unless b=0. So if the original eigenvalues are non-real and distinct, then their squares are also distinct. \n\nTherefore, the only case when eigenvalues of A\u00b2 could coincide is when the original eigenvalues are negatives of each other. Since the problem states \"two distinct eigenvalues\", which could be real or complex. But if they are real and distinct, then their squares could coincide if they are negatives. If they are complex, then their squares are distinct. \n\nTherefore, in the real case, if A has two distinct real eigenvalues, then it's possible that their squares are equal (like 1 and -1). If the eigenvalues are complex, then their squares are distinct. But since the problem says \"two distinct eigenvalues\", which could be complex, but the question is about A being a real matrix. \n\nHowever, the problem says \"must be true\". Since there exists a real matrix with two distinct real eigenvalues (like 1 and -1) whose squares are equal, then the statement III is not necessarily true. \n\nTherefore, only II must be true. \n\nSo the answer is II only. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{II}\n</think>\n\nTo determine which statements about a real 2x2 matrix \\( A \\) must be true, we analyze each statement as follows:\n\n**Statement I: All of the entries of \\( A^2 \\) are nonnegative.**\n\nConsider the matrix \\( A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). Calculating \\( A^2 \\):\n\\[\nA^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -2 \\\\ -2 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe off-diagonal entries of \\( A^2 \\) are negative, so Statement I is false.\n\n**Statement II: The determinant of \\( A^2 \\) is nonnegative.**\n\nThe determinant of \\( A^2 \\) is \\( (\\det A)^2 \\). Since the square of any real number is nonnegative, \\( \\det(A^2) \\) is always nonnegative. Thus, Statement II is true.\n\n**Statement III: If \\( A \\) has two distinct eigenvalues, then \\( A^2 \\) has two distinct eigenvalues.**\n\nConsider a matrix \\( A \\) with eigenvalues \\( 1 \\) and \\( -1 \\), such as \\( A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\). The eigenvalues of \\( A^2 \\) are \\( 1^2 = 1 \\) and \\( (-1)^2 = 1 \\), which are not distinct. Hence, Statement III is false.\n\nThus, the only statement that must be true is Statement II.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{II}\n\\]"
