        "question": "How many attempts should you make to cannulate a patient before passing the job on to a senior colleague, according to the medical knowledge of 2020?",
        "response": "According to the medical knowledge of 2020, there is no specific number of attempts that a junior doctor should make before passing the job on to a senior colleague. However, it is generally recommended that a junior doctor should not attempt cannulation more than three times on the same patient before seeking help from a senior colleague. This is to avoid causing unnecessary discomfort or harm to the patient, and to ensure that the cannulation is performed safely and effectively."
