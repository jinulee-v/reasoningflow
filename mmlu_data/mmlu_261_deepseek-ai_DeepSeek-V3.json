        "question": "Which of the following is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers?",
        "response": "The best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers is a **human rights and humanitarian perspective**. This approach focuses on the ethical, legal, and moral implications of using children in armed conflicts, emphasizing their vulnerability, the violation of their rights, and the long-term psychological and physical impacts on their lives. It also considers international laws and conventions, such as the **United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)** and the **Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict**, which aim to protect children from exploitation in war.\n\nAdditionally, a **socio-political and economic lens** can be valuable to understand the root causes of child soldier recruitment, such as poverty, lack of education, and systemic inequality. Combining these perspectives provides a comprehensive understanding of the issue and informs strategies for prevention, rehabilitation, and reintegration of former child soldiers."
