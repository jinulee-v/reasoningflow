        "response": "Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. A positive correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases, while a negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. Correlation does not imply causation, meaning that just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one causes the other."
