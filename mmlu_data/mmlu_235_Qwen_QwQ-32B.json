        "question": "Box a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization had the following transactions during the year: Proceeds from sale of investments $80000 Purchase of property plant and equipment $10000 Proceeds from long-term debt $100000 Loss on sale of investment $5000 What amount should be reported as net cash provided by financing activities in Box's statement of cash flows?",
        "response": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about determining the net cash provided by financing activities for Box, a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization. They've given me some transactions: proceeds from the sale of investments, purchase of property plant and equipment, proceeds from long-term debt, and a loss on sale of investment. Hmm, I need to recall what each of these items relates to in the cash flow statement.\n\nFirst, I remember that the cash flow statement is divided into three sections: operating, investing, and financing activities. The question is specifically about financing activities. Let me think about what falls under financing activities. From what I learned, financing activities typically involve transactions related to the organization's owners or creditors. That includes things like issuing or repaying debt, issuing or buying back stock, paying dividends, and other similar items.\n\nLooking at the transactions provided:\n\n1. Proceeds from sale of investments: $80,000. Wait, the sale of investments... isn't that an investing activity? Because investing activities involve the purchase and sale of long-term assets and investments. So proceeds from selling investments would be in investing, not financing. So that's probably not part of financing activities.\n\n2. Purchase of property, plant, and equipment: $10,000. Again, purchasing PPE is an investing activity because it's a long-term asset. So that's investing, not financing.\n\n3. Proceeds from long-term debt: $100,000. Okay, this sounds like financing. When a company or organization borrows money through long-term debt, the proceeds from issuing that debt are a financing cash inflow. So this should be included in financing activities.\n\n4. Loss on sale of investment: $5,000. Hmm, losses on sales... I think that's a non-cash item. Wait, but when you sell an investment, the cash received is the proceeds, and the loss is the difference between the proceeds and the book value. But in the cash flow statement, the actual cash received is the proceeds, so the loss itself isn't a cash flow. The loss would affect the investing activities section's net cash, but since we're only asked about financing, maybe this loss isn't part of financing. So probably not included here.\n\nSo, the question is asking for the net cash provided by financing activities. From the items listed, only the proceeds from long-term debt of $100,000 is a financing activity. The other items are either investing activities or non-cash adjustments. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, could there be any other financing activities mentioned here? The problem lists four transactions, and only the proceeds from long-term debt are financing. The others are investing. The loss on sale is part of the investing activity's calculation but doesn't affect financing. So, the net cash from financing should just be the $100,000. \n\nBut let me think again. Sometimes people get confused between investing and financing. For example, if they had issued stock, that's financing. Proceeds from loans (debt) are financing. The sale of investments is investing. Purchasing PPE is investing outflow. The loss on sale is non-cash, so it's added back somewhere else, but in the cash flow, the actual cash received is the proceeds, so the loss doesn't directly impact the cash received. \n\nTherefore, the only financing activity here is the $100,000 from long-term debt. So the net cash provided by financing activities should be $100,000. \n\nWait, but the question says \"net cash provided by financing activities\". Since there's only an inflow here from the debt, and no outflows mentioned in financing (like repayment of debt or dividends), then yes, it's just $100,000. \n\nI think that's it. Let me confirm once more. The key is to categorize each item correctly. Proceeds from long-term debt is financing. The rest are investing. So the answer is $100,000.\n</think>\n\nThe net cash provided by financing activities on Box's statement of cash flows is calculated by considering only the transactions related to financing activities. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- **Proceeds from long-term debt**: $100,000 (this is a financing activity as it involves borrowing).  \n- **Other transactions**:  \n  - Proceeds from sale of investments ($80,000) and purchase of property, plant, and equipment ($10,000) are **investing activities**.  \n  - The loss on sale of investments ($5,000) is a non-cash item and does not affect cash flow directly.  \n\nSince no financing cash outflows (e.g., debt repayments) are mentioned, the **net cash provided by financing activities** is simply the proceeds from long-term debt.  \n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{100000}$"
