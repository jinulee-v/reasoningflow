        "question": "Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?\n\n(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis\n\n(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used\n\n(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used\n\n(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which of these statements about p-values and test rejection is true. The given p-value is 0.08. Let me recall what a p-value means. The p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Right? So, if the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (alpha), we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we don't reject it.\n\nNow, let's go through each statement one by one.\n\nStatement (i): \"If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis.\" Hmm. The size of the test is the same as the significance level, alpha. So, if alpha is 8% (0.08), then since the p-value is exactly equal to alpha, we would be at the boundary. In some textbooks, they say you reject the null if the p-value is less than alpha, and do not reject if it's greater. But if it's equal, it's kind of a tie. So, depending on the convention, sometimes you might reject, sometimes not. But I think the standard approach is that if p-value \u2264 alpha, reject. So, if p-value equals alpha, you still reject. Wait, but maybe some sources say strictly less than. Hmm. Let me check. I think generally, the decision rule is to reject H0 when p-value \u2264 alpha. So, if the p-value is exactly equal to alpha, you do reject. Therefore, statement (i) says we would be indifferent, but according to the standard rule, we would actually reject. So, maybe statement (i) is not true? Because if alpha is 8%, p-value is 8%, so we should reject. Therefore, being indifferent is not correct. So, statement (i) is false.\n\nStatement (ii): \"The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used.\" Okay, alpha is 10% (0.10). The p-value is 0.08. Since 0.08 \u2264 0.10, we reject the null. So, this statement is true. So, (ii) is correct.\n\nStatement (iii): \"The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used.\" Alpha is 0.01. The p-value is 0.08, which is greater than 0.01. Therefore, we do not reject the null. So, this statement is true. So, (iii) is correct.\n\nStatement (iv): \"The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\" Alpha is 0.05. The p-value is 0.08, which is greater than 0.05. Therefore, we do not reject the null. So, statement (iv) is false.\n\nWait, but hold on. The question says \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" implying only one is correct. But according to my analysis, both (ii) and (iii) are correct. Let me check again.\n\nStatement (i): If alpha is 8%, p-value is 8%, so reject. So, statement (i) says \"indifferent,\" which is incorrect. So, (i) is false.\n\nStatement (ii): Alpha 10%, p-value 8%: reject. Correct.\n\nStatement (iii): Alpha 1%, p-value 8%: do not reject. Correct.\n\nStatement (iv): Alpha 5%, p-value 8%: do not reject. So, (iv) is false.\n\nBut the problem says \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" So, maybe there's a mistake here? Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the options are (i) through (iv). The user is asking which one is true. So, maybe multiple can be true? But the way the question is phrased, \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" suggests only one is correct. But according to my analysis, both (ii) and (iii) are correct. Hmm. Let me verify.\n\nWait, maybe statement (i) is actually correct? If the size of the test is 8%, then the p-value equals the significance level. In some statistical frameworks, the critical value is such that if the test statistic is exactly at the critical value, you are on the boundary. So, in that case, you might say that you are indifferent. But in practice, the decision rule is usually to reject when p-value \u2264 alpha. So, if p-value equals alpha, you still reject. Therefore, statement (i) is incorrect because it says \"we would be indifferent,\" but actually, you would reject. So, (i) is false.\n\nTherefore, statements (ii) and (iii) are both correct. But the problem might be designed in a way where only one is supposed to be correct. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the term \"size of the test\" refers to the pre-specified alpha level. So, (i) says if the size is 8%, we are indifferent. But in reality, if alpha is 8%, and p-value is 8%, you would reject. So, (i) is false.\n\n(ii) 10% alpha: 0.08 < 0.10, so reject. Correct.\n\n(iii) 1% alpha: 0.08 > 0.01, do not reject. Correct.\n\n(iv) 5% alpha: 0.08 > 0.05, do not reject. So, (iv) is false.\n\nSo, both (ii) and (iii) are correct. But the problem says \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" Maybe there's a mistake in the question? Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the definitions again. The size of a test is the probability of Type I error, which is the same as the significance level alpha. So, if the p-value is less than or equal to alpha, reject. So, (ii) and (iii) are both correct. But maybe the original question expects only one correct answer. Wait, let me check the original question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?\n\n(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis\n\n(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used\n\n(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used\n\n(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\"\n\nSo, according to standard hypothesis testing procedure:\n\n- If p-value \u2264 alpha: reject H0\n\n- If p-value > alpha: do not reject H0\n\nTherefore:\n\n(i) If alpha = 8% (0.08), p-value = 0.08. Since 0.08 \u2264 0.08, reject H0. So, statement (i) says \"indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting,\" which is incorrect. So, (i) is false.\n\n(ii) alpha = 10% (0.10). p-value = 0.08 \u2264 0.10: reject H0. So, (ii) is true.\n\n(iii) alpha = 1% (0.01). p-value = 0.08 > 0.01: do not reject H0. So, (iii) is true.\n\n(iv) alpha = 5% (0.05). p-value = 0.08 > 0.05: do not reject H0. So, (iv) is false.\n\nTherefore, both (ii) and (iii) are correct. But the question says \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" Maybe it's a multiple-select question, but the options are given as (i) to (iv), each separate. Wait, the user hasn't specified whether multiple can be correct. But in the original problem, if it's from a multiple-choice question, sometimes only one is correct. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nWait, let me check statement (i) again. The term \"indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting.\" Maybe in some textbooks, when p-value equals alpha, it's considered a marginal case, and some people might argue about indifference. But according to the strict Neyman-Pearson approach, you pre-specify alpha, and if p-value \u2264 alpha, you reject. There's no indifference; it's a decision. So, indifference is not part of the standard hypothesis testing framework. Therefore, statement (i) is incorrect because you should reject at alpha = 8%.\n\nTherefore, statements (ii) and (iii) are both correct. But the problem is presented as a single choice. Wait, maybe the original question is from a source where multiple can be correct, but the user here is presenting it as a single answer? Wait, the user wrote \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" So, expecting one answer. But according to the analysis, two answers are correct. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nStatement (ii): 10% size. p-value 0.08 < 0.10: reject. Correct.\n\nStatement (iii): 1% size. p-value 0.08 > 0.01: do not reject. Correct.\n\nSo, both (ii) and (iii) are correct. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the question. Wait, maybe \"size of the test\" is different from significance level? Wait, no. In statistics, the size of a test is the same as the significance level, which is the probability of Type I error. So, size = alpha. So, if the question uses \"size\" correctly, then (ii) and (iii) are both correct.\n\nBut maybe the original question had a typo or expects only one answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is both (ii) and (iii), but the user here expects us to box both? Wait, the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" Typically, \\boxed{} is used for a single answer. So, maybe the question is erroneous, or perhaps I misread something.\n\nWait, let me check statement (iv) again. \"The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\" p-value 0.08 > 0.05, so do not reject. So, (iv) is false. So, only (ii) and (iii) are correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" Maybe in the original source, the options are (i)-(iv), and the correct answers are both (ii) and (iii), but presented as separate options. If the user is following a format where only one is correct, maybe there's an error. Alternatively, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, perhaps statement (i) is considered true in some contexts. If the test statistic is exactly at the critical value, then technically, the probability of rejecting is at the boundary. But in practice, when you compute p-values, you reject if p \u2264 alpha. So, if p = alpha, you still reject. So, indifference is not standard. Therefore, (i) is false.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a different interpretation, (ii) and (iii) are both correct. But given the way the question is phrased, expecting a single answer, maybe the intended answer is both (ii) and (iii). But how to represent that? If the options are (i) to (iv), and both (ii) and (iii) are correct, but the question says \"Which one\", then there's a problem with the question. Alternatively, maybe the original question had different p-values or different alphas.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. p-value is 0.08.\n\nStatement (ii): 10% size (0.10). 0.08 \u2264 0.10: reject. Correct.\n\nStatement (iii): 1% size (0.01). 0.08 > 0.01: do not reject. Correct.\n\nSo, both are correct. Therefore, unless the question allows multiple correct answers, but the user here says \"Which one\", maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii), and the user expects multiple boxed answers. But the instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", which is usually for one answer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the term \"size of the test\". Wait, size is the same as significance level, right? Yes, size is the probability of Type I error, which is the same as alpha. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"size\" refers to something else, like sample size? No, that doesn't make sense. Size of the test is a standard term for the significance level.\n\nTherefore, unless the question is erroneous, both (ii) and (iii) are correct. But given the options, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii). However, since the user asks to put the final answer within \\boxed{}, and typically multiple choice questions have a single answer, perhaps the intended answer is (ii) and (iii). But how to represent that? Maybe the options are actually (i) through (iv), and the correct ones are (ii) and (iii). But if the original question is designed to have only one correct answer, perhaps there's a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check once more.\n\nWait, let me think. If a test has size alpha, that means the probability of rejecting when the null is true is alpha. So, if the p-value is exactly equal to alpha, then the probability of getting a result as extreme as the observed one is exactly alpha. So, in that case, you are at the boundary. In some textbooks, they might phrase it as \"we would be indifferent,\" but in practice, you follow the rule: reject if p \u2264 alpha. So, indifference is not part of the standard decision rule. Therefore, (i) is incorrect.\n\nSo, unless there's a specific textbook that defines indifference at p = alpha, which I haven't encountered, (i) is false.\n\nTherefore, (ii) and (iii) are correct. But the problem says \"Which one...\", so maybe the user made a mistake in transcribing the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii), but since the user expects a single boxed answer, perhaps there's an error. Alternatively, maybe I need to select all that apply. But given the initial problem statement, I think the correct answers are (ii) and (iii). However, since the user might expect a single answer, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe statement (i) is true. If the size is 8%, then the critical value corresponds to the p-value. So, if the test statistic is exactly at the critical value, then the p-value is equal to the size. In that case, some sources might say that you can't reject or fail to reject, hence indifferent. But in practice, you have to make a decision: either reject or not. The standard approach is to reject when p \u2264 alpha. So, if p = alpha, reject. Therefore, statement (i) is false.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a different convention, (ii) and (iii) are correct. Since the problem might have multiple correct answers, but presented as separate options, perhaps the answer is both (ii) and (iii). But since the user instruction says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", maybe the answer is both (ii) and (iii), written as \\boxed{ii} and \\boxed{iii}, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is (ii) and (iii), but the system expects multiple choices. However, given the way the question is presented here, I think the user might expect multiple correct answers. But since the original question says \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" maybe there's a mistake in the original question, or perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii), and the user expects us to write both. But given the standard multiple-choice format where only one is correct, perhaps the intended answer is (ii) and (iii). But since I can't ask the user, I need to proceed with the information given.\n\nGiven that, I think both (ii) and (iii) are correct. However, if forced to choose only one, perhaps the intended answer is (ii) and (iii). But since the user hasn't specified multiple answers, maybe there's an error. Alternatively, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me check statement (iv) again. \"The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.\" p-value is 0.08 > 0.05, so do not reject. So, (iv) is false. So, only (ii) and (iii) are correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"Which one of the following statements is true?\" So, maybe the original question had different numbers? For example, if the p-value was 0.08, then:\n\n(i) 8%: reject, so (i) is false.\n\n(ii) 10%: reject, true.\n\n(iii) 1%: do not reject, true.\n\n(iv) 5%: do not reject, false.\n\nTherefore, two statements are true. But the question is presented as \"Which one...\", which is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is both (ii) and (iii). But since the user hasn't indicated multiple answers, maybe there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii). But given the standard format, I think the answer should be both (ii) and (iii). However, since the user might expect a single answer, I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii), and the user expects \\boxed{ii} and \\boxed{iii}, but that's unconventional. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii), written as \\boxed{ii} and \\boxed{iii}. But I need to follow the user's instruction. The user says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". So, likely expecting one boxed answer. But according to the analysis, two answers are correct. Therefore, there's inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii), and the user expects multiple boxed answers. But standard practice is one box. Therefore, perhaps the question is erroneous. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check statement (i) again. If the size is 8%, then the rejection region is defined such that the probability of Type I error is 8%. If the p-value is exactly 8%, then the test statistic is exactly at the critical value. In some textbooks, they mention that the critical value is included in the rejection region. Therefore, you would reject H0. Therefore, statement (i) is false. So, only (ii) and (iii) are correct.\n\nTherefore, given that, but the question says \"Which one...\", maybe the answer is both (ii) and (iii). But since the user hasn't specified multiple answers, perhaps the answer is (ii) and (iii). However, given the standard multiple-choice format, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii), but presented as separate options. But since they are separate options, both can be correct. Therefore, the correct answers are (ii) and (iii). So, if the user allows multiple selections, then both are correct. But since the user instruction is to put the final answer within a single box, maybe the answer is (ii) and (iii). But how to represent that? Maybe \\boxed{ii} and \\boxed{iii}, but that's not standard. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo, and only one is correct. But based on the given information, both (ii) and (iii) are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original question had different p-values. For example, if the p-value was 0.08, then:\n\n- At 10%: reject\n\n- At 1%: do not reject\n\nSo, both (ii) and (iii) are correct. Therefore, unless the question is designed to have multiple correct answers, which is possible, then both (ii) and (iii) are correct. However, given the phrasing \"Which one of the following statements is true?\", it's conflicting. But since the user hasn't indicated multiple answers, perhaps there's a mistake in the question. However, based on the information given, I must conclude that both (ii) and (iii) are correct. Therefore, the answer is both (ii) and (iii). But since the user expects a single boxed answer, maybe there's an error. Alternatively, the intended answer is (ii) and (iii). But I need to proceed with the information given.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but following strict hypothesis testing rules, both (ii) and (iii) are correct. Therefore, the answer is both (ii) and (iii). However, since the user might expect a single answer, perhaps the intended answer is (ii) and (iii). But given the standard multiple-choice format, this is confusing. Therefore, I think the correct answer is both (ii) and (iii). So, I will state that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{ii} and \\boxed{iii}\n\nBut since the platform might not accept multiple boxed answers, perhaps the correct answers are (ii) and (iii). However, given the original question's phrasing, it's possible that only one was intended. But based on the analysis, both are correct. Therefore, the answer is both (ii) and (iii).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{ii} and \\boxed{iii}"
