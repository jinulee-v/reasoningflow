        "question": "In a 2 pole lap winding dc machine , the resistance of one conductor is 2\u03a9 and total number of conductors is 100. Find the total resistance",
        "response": "To find the total resistance in a 2-pole lap winding DC machine, we need to understand how the conductors are connected. In a lap winding, the conductors are connected in parallel.\n\nGiven:\n- Resistance of one conductor (R) = 2 \u03a9\n- Total number of conductors (N) = 100\n\nSince the conductors are connected in parallel, the total resistance (R_total) can be calculated using the formula for parallel resistances:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{R_N} \\]\n\nFor N identical resistors in parallel:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{N}{R} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{R}{N} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{2 \\, \\Omega}{100} = 0.02 \\, \\Omega \\]\n\nSo, the total resistance of the 2-pole lap winding DC machine is 0.02 \u03a9."
