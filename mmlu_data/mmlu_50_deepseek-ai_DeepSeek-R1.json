        "question": "A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the angular magnification of a refracting telescope. Let me start by recalling what I know about telescopes. A refracting telescope uses two converging lenses: the objective lens and the eyepiece lens. The objective is the larger lens that gathers light from the object, and the eyepiece is the smaller lens that you look through. The angular magnification of the telescope depends on the focal lengths of these two lenses.\n\nThe problem says the telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eyepiece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. They want the angular magnification. Hmm, angular magnification... I think the formula for angular magnification (M) of a telescope is the focal length of the objective (f_o) divided by the focal length of the eyepiece (f_e). So M = -f_o / f_e. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted, but since they're asking for angular magnification, maybe they just want the absolute value? Or maybe in astronomical telescopes, the inversion doesn't matter because it's just about the angular size. Anyway, the formula is based on the ratio of the focal lengths.\n\nBut wait, the separation between the lenses is given as 100 cm. In a telescope, the distance between the objective and the eyepiece should be the sum of their focal lengths, right? Because the objective forms an image at its focal point, and the eyepiece is placed so that its focal point coincides with that image. So in a normal telescope setup, the separation (distance between the lenses) is f_o + f_e. So if the separation is 100 cm, and the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm, then the focal length of the objective must be 100 cm - 20 cm = 80 cm. Is that correct?\n\nLet me verify. If the objective focal length is f_o and the eyepiece is f_e, then the tube length is f_o + f_e. So yes, if the separation is 100 cm and f_e is 20 cm, then f_o = 100 cm - 20 cm = 80 cm. Therefore, the angular magnification M is f_o / f_e = 80 cm / 20 cm = 4. So the magnification is 4 times. But wait, angular magnification is usually given as a negative number to indicate inversion, but maybe here they just want the magnitude. The problem says \"angular magnification\", and typically in astronomical telescopes, the magnification is given as a positive number even though the image is inverted because celestial objects don't have a right-side-up. So maybe 4 is the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Angular magnification for telescopes is indeed the ratio of the focal lengths. The formula is M = -f_o / f_e. So if f_o is 80 cm and f_e is 20 cm, then M = -80 / 20 = -4. But again, depending on the convention, sometimes the magnification is given as absolute value. The problem doesn't specify, but since it's a simple ratio, maybe they expect 4. Let me check the question again.\n\n\"The angular magnification of the telescope is...\" and the options aren't given, but since it's a numerical answer, probably expects a positive number. So 4. But let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, another way to think about angular magnification: it's the angle subtended by the image divided by the angle subtended by the object. In the case of a telescope, the object is very far away, so the angle subtended by the object is approximately the angle of the rays entering the objective lens. The telescope then forms an image at infinity, so the angle subtended by the image is the angle of the rays leaving the eyepiece. The ratio of these angles is the angular magnification. For a telescope focused at infinity, the angular magnification is indeed f_o / f_e. So yes, 80 / 20 = 4. So the answer should be 4. But let me check if the separation is indeed f_o + f_e.\n\nIn a refracting telescope, when adjusted for relaxed viewing (i.e., the image is at infinity), the distance between the lenses is indeed the sum of their focal lengths. So if the separation is 100 cm, and the eyepiece is 20 cm, then the objective must be 80 cm. Therefore, M = 80 / 20 = 4. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the separation is just the focal length of the objective, that would be wrong. But no, the standard formula is that the separation is f_o + f_e. So yes, 100 cm separation implies f_o + f_e = 100 cm. Given f_e = 20 cm, f_o = 80 cm. Therefore, magnification is 4. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular magnification of the telescope is \\boxed{4}."
