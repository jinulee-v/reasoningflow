        "question": "Statement 1 | If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. Statement 2 | If H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true or not. Let me start with Statement 1: \"If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|.\" Hmm, factor group, which is also called a quotient group, right? So, aH is a coset in the factor group G/H. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element. But here, we're talking about the order of a coset aH in the factor group G/H. \n\nSo, |aH| would be the smallest positive integer n such that (aH)^n = H, since H is the identity element in G/H. But (aH)^n is equal to a^n H, right? Because when you multiply cosets, you multiply their representatives and then take the coset. So, a^n H = H implies that a^n is in H. Therefore, the order of aH in G/H is the smallest n such that a^n \u2208 H. \n\nOn the other hand, |a| is the order of the element a in G, which is the smallest positive integer m such that a^m = e. So, the statement claims that this n divides m. Is that necessarily true? Let me think. \n\nIf a^n is in H, then (a^n)^k = a^{nk} = e for some k such that nk is a multiple of |a|. Wait, but actually, if a^n \u2208 H, then the order of aH in G/H is n, and since a^m = e \u2208 H (because H is a subgroup and must contain the identity), then m must be a multiple of n. Because if a^m = e \u2208 H, then n divides m. That's the standard result: the order of an element in the quotient group divides the order of the element in the original group. So, actually, |aH| divides |a|. Therefore, Statement 1 is true. Wait, but let me check with an example to be sure.\n\nTake G = Z (integers under addition), H = 2Z. Then G/H is the group Z/2Z, which has two elements: 0 + 2Z and 1 + 2Z. Let's take a = 1 in Z. The order of a in G is infinite because you can never add 1 to itself enough times to get 0 unless you do it zero times. But in the factor group G/H, the order of a + H is 2 because 1 + 1 = 2, which is in H, so 2*(1 + H) = H. So, |aH| = 2, and |a| is infinite. But 2 divides infinite? That doesn't make sense. Wait, so in this case, the statement would be problematic because |a| is infinite, and |aH| is finite. So, how does the divisibility work here? \n\nDivisibility in the context of group theory orders usually applies when both orders are finite. If |a| is infinite, then |aH| can be finite or infinite. If |aH| is finite, then it can't divide an infinite order. So, maybe the statement is only true when |a| is finite? But the problem statement doesn't specify. So, perhaps Statement 1 is not necessarily true in general. Wait, but in the case where |a| is finite, then |aH| divides |a|. Let me verify that.\n\nSuppose G is a finite group, and H is a normal subgroup. Take a \u2208 G, and let |a| = m. Then, in G/H, the order of aH is the smallest n such that a^n \u2208 H. Since a^m = e \u2208 H, then n divides m. That's a theorem in group theory: the order of an element in the quotient group divides the order of the element in the original group. So, if |a| is finite, then |aH| divides |a|. But if |a| is infinite, then |aH| can be finite or infinite. For example, in the previous example with G = Z and H = 2Z, a =1 has infinite order, but aH has order 2. So, in that case, the statement would be false because 2 doesn't divide infinity. But maybe in the problem's context, they are considering finite groups? The problem doesn't specify. Hmm. \n\nSince the problem doesn't specify that G is finite, Statement 1 is not necessarily true. Therefore, Statement 1 is false in general. Wait, but maybe I need to check another example. Let's take G = S_3, the symmetric group on 3 elements, and H = A_3, the alternating group. Then G/H has order 2. Take a transposition, say (1 2), which has order 2 in G. Then, in G/H, the coset (1 2)H has order 2 because ((1 2)H)^2 = (1 2)^2 H = eH = H. So, |aH| = 2, and |a| = 2, so 2 divides 2. That works. Another example: take G = Z_4 (integers mod 4), H = {0, 2}. Then G/H has two elements: H and 1 + H. The order of 1 in G is 4. The order of 1 + H in G/H is 2, since 1 + 1 = 2 \u2208 H. So, 2 divides 4. That works. If |a| is finite, then |aH| divides |a|. But if |a| is infinite, then |aH| can be finite, which doesn't divide. So, unless the group is finite, Statement 1 is false. Since the problem didn't specify finiteness, Statement 1 is false. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, moving on to Statement 2: \"If H and K are subgroups of G, then HK is a subgroup of G.\" HK is the set {hk | h \u2208 H, k \u2208 K}. I remember that for HK to be a subgroup, one of the subgroups needs to be normal, or some other condition. The standard result is that HK is a subgroup if and only if HK = KH. So, if H and K are arbitrary subgroups, HK might not be a subgroup. Let me think of a counterexample.\n\nTake G = S_3, H = {e, (1 2)}, K = {e, (1 3)}. Then HK = {e*e, e*(1 3), (1 2)*e, (1 2)*(1 3)} = {e, (1 3), (1 2), (1 2 3)}. Is HK a subgroup? Let's check closure. For example, (1 2) * (1 3) = (1 3 2), which is not in HK. So, HK is not closed under multiplication, hence not a subgroup. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nAlternatively, another example: Take G = D_4 (dihedral group of order 8), H = {e, r^2, s, sr^2}, K = {e, r}. Then HK would be {e, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3}. But D_4 has order 8, and HK has 8 elements, but HK is the entire group. Wait, but D_4 is closed, so HK is a subgroup. Hmm, maybe that's not a good example. Wait, but in S_3, HK had 4 elements, which doesn't divide 6, so it can't be a subgroup. So, yes, HK is not necessarily a subgroup unless certain conditions are met. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, conclusion: Statement 1 is false (because when |a| is infinite, |aH| can be finite, which doesn't divide), and Statement 2 is false (because HK isn't necessarily a subgroup unless HK=KH). Therefore, both statements are false.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, in Statement 1, maybe the problem assumes that G is a finite group? If G is finite, then |a| is finite, and |aH| divides |a|. But the problem didn't specify. In mathematics, unless specified, statements are considered in general. So, since there exists a case where Statement 1 is false (when |a| is infinite), then Statement 1 is false. Similarly, Statement 2 is false because there are counterexamples. Therefore, both statements are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nStatement 1 is \\boxed{False} and Statement 2 is \\boxed{False}."
