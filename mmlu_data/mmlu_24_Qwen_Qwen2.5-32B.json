It is a central metabolic pathway that occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and is a crucial step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The process of glycolysis can occur both aerobically (in the presence of oxygen) and anaerobically (in the absence of oxygen)."
