        "question": "How many attempts should you make to cannulate a patient before passing the job on to a senior colleague, according to the medical knowledge of 2020?",
        "response": "In medical practice, the number of attempts to cannulate a patient before seeking assistance from a senior colleague can vary depending on the clinical setting, the patient's condition, and the practitioner's experience. However, general guidelines suggest:\n\n1. **Two Attempts Rule**: Many institutions and guidelines recommend that if a healthcare professional is unsuccessful after two attempts, they should seek assistance from a more experienced colleague. This is to minimize patient discomfort, reduce the risk of complications (e.g., hematoma, infection), and ensure timely care.\n\n2. **Patient Factors**: If the patient has difficult venous access (e.g., due to obesity, dehydration, or chronic illness), it may be prudent to seek help sooner, even after one unsuccessful attempt.\n\n3. **Clinical Urgency**: In urgent or critical situations, if the first attempt is unsuccessful, immediate assistance should be sought to avoid delays in treatment.\n\n4. **Local Protocols**: Always follow your institution's specific protocols or guidelines, as they may have their own recommendations based on best practices and available resources.\n\nThe key is to balance persistence with the patient's well-being and the need for timely intervention. If in doubt, it is always better to seek help early rather than risk harm to the patient."
