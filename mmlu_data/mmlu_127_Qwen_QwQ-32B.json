        "question": "The variable $x$ varies directly as the square of $y$, and $y$ varies directly as the cube of $z$. If $x$ equals $-16$ when $z$ equals 2, what is the value of $x$ when $z$ equals $\\frac{1}{2}$?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where x varies directly as the square of y, and y varies directly as the cube of z. When z is 2, x is -16. Then I have to find x when z is 1/2. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I remember that \"varies directly\" means there's a proportionality involved. So if x varies directly as the square of y, that should be written as x = k * y\u00b2, where k is some constant. Similarly, y varies directly as the cube of z, so that would be y = m * z\u00b3, with m being another constant. \n\nMaybe I can combine these two equations to express x in terms of z? Let me try substituting the second equation into the first. If y is m*z\u00b3, then plugging that into x's equation gives x = k*(m*z\u00b3)\u00b2. That simplifies to x = k*m*z\u2076. So x is proportional to z to the sixth power, with the constant being k*m. \n\nBut I need to find the value of x when z is 1/2. To do that, I probably need to first find the constants k and m using the given information. Wait, but maybe I can combine the constants into one? Let me think. Since both relationships are direct variations, maybe I can write x in terms of z with a single constant?\n\nLet me try again. Since x = k*y\u00b2 and y = m*z\u00b3, substituting gives x = k*(m*z\u00b3)\u00b2 = k*m\u00b2*z\u2076. Wait, no, hold on. If y = m*z\u00b3, then y\u00b2 is (m*z\u00b3)\u00b2 = m\u00b2*z\u2076, so x = k*m\u00b2*z\u2076. Hmm, but that introduces two constants, k and m. Maybe I can combine them into a single constant? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express x directly in terms of z by combining the two variations. Since x varies directly with y\u00b2 and y varies directly with z\u00b3, then x varies directly with (z\u00b3)\u00b2, which is z\u2076. Therefore, x = C*z\u2076 where C is a constant. That might be a simpler way to think about it. So combining the two direct variations gives x proportional to z\u2076. \n\nYes, that seems better. So if I can write x = C*z\u2076, then I can use the given values to find C. When z is 2, x is -16. Let me plug that in. \n\nSo, -16 = C*(2)^6. 2^6 is 64, so -16 = 64C. Then solving for C, divide both sides by 64: C = -16/64, which simplifies to -1/4. \n\nTherefore, the equation is x = (-1/4)*z\u2076. Now, the question is asking for x when z is 1/2. Let me substitute z = 1/2 into that equation. \n\nFirst, compute (1/2)^6. That's (1^6)/(2^6) = 1/64. Then multiply by -1/4: x = (-1/4)*(1/64) = -1/(4*64) = -1/256. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with the variations: x \u221d y\u00b2 and y \u221d z\u00b3. So combining gives x \u221d (z\u00b3)\u00b2 = z\u2076. Therefore, x = C z\u2076. Then using x = -16 when z = 2: \n\nC = x / z\u2076 = (-16)/(2^6) = -16/64 = -1/4. \n\nThen for z = 1/2, x = (-1/4)*(1/2)^6. \n\nCalculating (1/2)^6: 1/64. \n\nMultiply by -1/4: -1/256. \n\nHmm, so that's the answer? Let me see. But maybe I should do it step by step with the two constants instead of combining them, just to verify. \n\nOriginal equations: \n\nx = k*y\u00b2 \n\ny = m*z\u00b3 \n\nSo when z = 2, y = m*(2)^3 = 8m. \n\nThen x = k*(8m)^2 = k*64m\u00b2. \n\nBut x is given as -16, so 64k m\u00b2 = -16. \n\nHmm, but now I have two constants, k and m. I need another equation to solve for both, but maybe since they are both constants of proportionality, perhaps they can be combined? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that y varies directly as z\u00b3, so the constant m is y/(z\u00b3). But without another value, maybe this approach requires more information. \n\nAlternatively, since both are direct variations, perhaps the combination is the right way. Since the problem didn't give me a separate value for y, maybe combining them into a single constant is the correct approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the relation between x and z through y. Let me see. \n\nSuppose I write x = k y\u00b2 and y = m z\u00b3. Then, substituting into x gives x = k (m z\u00b3)^2 = k m\u00b2 z^6. So x is proportional to z^6 with proportionality constant k m\u00b2. \n\nBut since we only have one data point (x=-16 when z=2), we can only find the combined constant. Let me call the combined constant C = k m\u00b2, so x = C z^6. Then, as before, C = x / z^6 = -16 / 64 = -1/4. \n\nTherefore, when z = 1/2, x = (-1/4)*(1/2)^6 = (-1/4)*(1/64) = -1/256. \n\nSo that seems consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a chain of variations. Since x varies directly as y\u00b2 and y varies directly as z\u00b3, then the relationship between x and z is through multiplying the variations. \n\nSo, the variation for x is (variation of y)^2, which is (z\u00b3)^2 = z^6. \n\nTherefore, x varies as z^6, so the constant is found as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use ratios. Since x is proportional to z^6, the ratio of x-values should be the ratio of z^6. \n\nSo, if x1 / x2 = (z1^6)/(z2^6). \n\nBut here, we can set up the ratio with the same constant C. \n\nSo x1 / x2 = (z1^6)/(z2^6). \n\nBut we know x1 is -16 when z1 is 2, and we want x2 when z2 is 1/2. \n\nSo plugging in: \n\n-16 / x2 = (2^6) / [(1/2)^6] \n\nCompute 2^6 = 64 \n\n(1/2)^6 = 1/64 \n\nTherefore, denominator is 1/64, so the ratio is 64 / (1/64) = 64 * 64/1 = 4096 \n\nTherefore, -16 / x2 = 4096 \n\nSolving for x2: x2 = -16 / 4096 = -1 / 256 \n\nSame answer. \n\nOkay, so that's a good check. \n\nTherefore, the value of x when z is 1/2 is -1/256. \n\nWait, but let me just confirm once again. \n\nFirst approach: x = C z^6, found C = -1/4. Then plug in z = 1/2: \n\n(1/2)^6 is 1/64. Multiply by -1/4 gives -1/256. \n\nSecond approach using ratios: same result. \n\nTherefore, seems correct. \n\nI think that's the answer. Maybe I was overcomplicating by thinking of two constants, but combining them into one works because we only have one data point. Since both variations are direct, their combination is also a direct variation with the exponents multiplied. \n\nAlternatively, if I had to use the two constants, let's see if that's possible. \n\nSuppose x = k y\u00b2 and y = m z\u00b3. \n\nWe have when z = 2, x = -16. \n\nFirst, find y when z = 2: y = m*(2)^3 = 8m. \n\nThen plug into x equation: -16 = k*(8m)^2 = k*64m\u00b2. \n\nSo 64 k m\u00b2 = -16. \n\nBut we have two variables here, k and m. So unless we have another equation, we can't solve for both. Therefore, this approach requires another equation, which we don't have. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to combine the variations into a single constant, which gives us the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the constants step by step. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps since y varies directly as z\u00b3, we can write y = m z\u00b3, so m is a constant. Then x varies directly as y\u00b2, so x = k y\u00b2. Therefore, substituting y gives x = k (m z\u00b3)^2 = k m\u00b2 z^6. So x is equal to (k m\u00b2) z^6. Let me call C = k m\u00b2, so x = C z^6. Then, since we can find C from the given data, that's exactly what I did before. \n\nTherefore, even if I think of it in terms of two constants, they just get multiplied into a single constant, so it's the same as combining them. \n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed -1/256. \n\nHmm, okay, so I think that's correct. Let me just recap all steps once more. \n\n1. Understand the relationships: x \u221d y\u00b2 and y \u221d z\u00b3. \n\n2. Combine the relationships: x \u221d (z\u00b3)\u00b2 = z\u2076, so x \u221d z\u2076. \n\n3. Write as equation: x = C z\u2076. \n\n4. Use given values (z=2, x=-16) to find C: \n\nC = x / z\u2076 = (-16)/(2^6) = -16/64 = -1/4. \n\n5. Now, write the equation as x = (-1/4) z\u2076. \n\n6. Find x when z = 1/2: \n\nx = (-1/4)*(1/2)^6 = (-1/4)*(1/64) = -1/256. \n\nAll steps check out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with exponents. Let me see. \n\nIf z is halved, from 2 to 1/2, that's a factor of 1/4 in z? Wait, no, 2 to 1/2 is multiplying by 1/4. Wait, actually, 2 to 1/2 is dividing by 4, so scaling factor is 1/4. \n\nBut since x depends on z\u2076, the scaling factor for x would be (1/4)^6, but also multiplied by the original x. Wait, let me think. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider the ratio of the new x to the old x: \n\n(x2 / x1) = (z2 / z1)^6 \n\nSo x2 = x1 * (z2 / z1)^6 \n\nPlugging in x1 = -16, z1 = 2, z2 = 1/2: \n\nx2 = -16 * ( (1/2)/2 )^6 \n\nSimplify inside the parentheses: (1/4) \n\nSo x2 = -16 * (1/4)^6 \n\nWait, (1/4)^6 is 1/4096 \n\nTherefore, x2 = -16 / 4096 = -1/256 \n\nSame result. \n\nTherefore, that's another way to see it. \n\nSo, all methods lead to -1/256, so I think that's the correct answer. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So I think that's the value of x when z is 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) when \\( z \\) equals \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{256}}\\).\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( x \\) varies directly as the square of \\( y \\), and \\( y \\) varies directly as the cube of \\( z \\), we can combine these relationships. \n\nFirst, we express the variations mathematically:\n- \\( x = k y^2 \\) (where \\( k \\) is a constant)\n- \\( y = m z^3 \\) (where \\( m \\) is another constant)\n\nSubstituting \\( y = m z^3 \\) into \\( x = k y^2 \\), we get:\n\\[\nx = k (m z^3)^2 = k m^2 z^6\n\\]\nThis simplifies to \\( x = C z^6 \\) where \\( C = k m^2 \\) is a combined constant.\n\nGiven \\( x = -16 \\) when \\( z = 2 \\), we can find \\( C \\):\n\\[\n-16 = C \\cdot 2^6 \\implies -16 = C \\cdot 64 \\implies C = \\frac{-16}{64} = -\\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation relating \\( x \\) and \\( z \\) is:\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{1}{4} z^6\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\) when \\( z = \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^6 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} = -\\frac{1}{256}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( x \\) when \\( z \\) equals \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{256}}\\)."
