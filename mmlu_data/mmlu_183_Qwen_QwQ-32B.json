        "question": "Arguing that what is true of the parts must be true of the whole is the fallacy of...",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what the fallacy is called when someone assumes that what's true for the parts must be true for the whole. Let me start by recalling what I know about logical fallacies. There are several types, like ad hominem, straw man, slippery slope, etc. But this one is specifically about parts and wholes.\n\nHmm, I think there's a term for this. Maybe composition or division? Wait, I remember something about the fallacy of composition. Let me think. The fallacy of composition is when you assume that what is true of a part is true of the whole. For example, if each part of a machine is light, then the whole machine must be light. But that's not necessarily true because the whole machine might have many parts adding up to a heavy total. \n\nWait, but is there another one? The fallacy of division is the reverse, right? That's when you assume that what's true of the whole must be true of the parts. So if the machine is heavy, each part must be heavy. That's the division fallacy. So the question here is about parts to whole, so composition. \n\nLet me check if I'm mixing them up. Yes, composition is part to whole, division is whole to part. So the answer should be the fallacy of composition. But I want to be sure. Let me think of examples. \n\nAnother example: \"Every player on the team is the best in their position, so the team is the best overall.\" That's composition because each part (player) is considered the best, so the whole (team) must be the best. But maybe the team doesn't work well together, so that's a fallacy. \n\nAlternatively, \"Water is made of hydrogen and oxygen, which are gases, so water must be a gas.\" That's also composition. The parts are gases, but the whole (water) is a liquid. So that's a clear case of the fallacy. \n\nTherefore, the fallacy in question here is the fallacy of composition. I think that's right. Let me see if there's another term. Maybe \"fallacy of the whole and the parts,\" but I think composition is the standard name. Yeah, I'm pretty confident now. The answer is the fallacy of composition.\n</think>\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that what is true of the parts must be true of the whole is known as the **fallacy of composition**. \n\n### Explanation:\n- **Definition**: This fallacy occurs when one incorrectly infers that a property or characteristic of individual parts (or components) necessarily applies to the entire system or whole they constitute. \n- **Example**: \n  - *\"Every member of the soccer team is fast, so the team as a whole must be the fastest team in the league.\"* \n  - Here, individual speed does not guarantee collective speed, as teamwork, strategy, or coordination might be lacking.\n- **Contrast**: The reverse\u2014assuming a property of the whole applies to its parts\u2014is called the **fallacy of division** (e.g., *\"The symphony sounds beautiful, so every individual instrument must sound beautiful alone\"*).\n\nThis reasoning error ignores how emergent properties, interactions, or systemic dynamics can produce different outcomes in the whole compared to its individual parts. \n\n**Answer**: The fallacy of composition."
