        "question": "In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?",
        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equations. The frequency of the recessive allele (b) can be calculated from the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (bb), which is given as 1/400. The frequency of the recessive allele (b) is the square root of the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype (bb), which is sqrt(1/400) = 1/20. The frequency of the dominant allele (B) is 1 - the frequency of the recessive allele (b), which is 1 - 1/20 = 19/20. The frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Bb) is 2 * the frequency of the dominant allele (B) * the frequency of the recessive allele (b), which is 2 * 19/20 * 1/20 = 19/200. Therefore, the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer is 19/200, which is approximately 0.095 or 9.5%."
