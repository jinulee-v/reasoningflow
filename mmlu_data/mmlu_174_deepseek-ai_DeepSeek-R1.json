    },
    "raw_text": {
        "question": "How the consent to be bound of a State may be expressed?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how a state can express its consent to be bound by an international treaty. Let me start by recalling what I know about international law. From what I remember, states become parties to treaties through various methods, and each method involves some form of consent. \n\nFirst, there's signing a treaty. But wait, isn't signing sometimes not enough? I think some treaties require ratification even after signing. So maybe signature alone can express consent if the treaty specifies that. But in other cases, the signature is just a preliminary step, and ratification is needed. So signature can be a way, but only if the treaty allows it.\n\nThen there's ratification. Ratification is when the state confirms the signature and agrees to be bound. But ratification is usually done by the state's domestic procedures, like getting approval from the parliament or some other body. So ratification is another method.\n\nAccession comes to mind. Accession is when a state that didn't sign the treaty originally later agrees to join it. So that's like joining a treaty after it's already been made, right? So accession is another way to express consent.\n\nWhat about acceptance or approval? I think these terms are sometimes used similarly to ratification, especially in states where the executive can approve a treaty without legislative involvement. So maybe acceptance and approval are alternative terms for expressing consent, depending on the state's internal processes.\n\nThen there's exchange of instruments. For example, in bilateral treaties, states might exchange documents that serve as their mutual consent. So exchanging letters or notes could be a method.\n\nAlso, some treaties might allow states to express consent through a specific procedure outlined in the treaty itself. For example, a treaty might say that consent is given by depositing an instrument with a depositary, like the UN Secretary-General.\n\nI should also consider the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), which probably codifies these methods. Let me check... Yes, the VCLT Articles 11 to 16 cover the ways states express consent. Article 11 says consent can be expressed by signature, exchange of instruments, ratification, acceptance, approval, or accession, or any other agreed means.\n\nSo putting this all together, the main methods are signature (when the treaty allows it), ratification, accession, acceptance, approval, exchange of instruments, and any other means agreed upon by the states involved. Each method has its own context and requirements. For example, ratification typically follows a signature and involves domestic procedures, while accession is for joining a treaty without prior signature.\n\nI should also mention that some treaties enter into force only after a certain number of ratifications or accessions. So the expression of consent is a crucial step in making the treaty effective. Also, reservations might be made when a state consents, but that's a different topic.\n\nWait, are there any other methods? Maybe provisional application? But provisional application is when a state applies the treaty provisionally before formal ratification, but I think that's more about application rather than expressing consent to be bound. So maybe not. Or maybe notifications? If a treaty requires a notification to express consent, that could be another method, but perhaps that's covered under the other categories.\n\nSo to summarize, the ways a state can express consent to be bound are: signature, ratification, accession, acceptance, approval, exchange of instruments, and any other agreed method. Each of these has specific contexts and procedures as per the treaty and the state's domestic laws."
