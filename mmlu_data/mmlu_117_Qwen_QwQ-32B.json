        "question": "Which of the following cases established the precedent that a defendant must be informed of the right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer, and protection from self-incrimination?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which case established the precedent that a defendant must be informed of their right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer, and protection from self-incrimination. Hmm, I remember that these rights are part of the Miranda warnings, right? Like when cops say \"You have the right to remain silent...\" before arresting someone. So maybe the case is called Miranda vs. Arizona? Let me think.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the case that set this precedent. The Miranda warning comes from a Supreme Court case. The defendant in that case must have been named Miranda. So the case would be Miranda v. Arizona. But I should make sure I'm not mixing it up with another case. Let me recall. The Supreme Court decided this in the 1960s, I believe. The ruling was that the police must inform suspects of their rights upon arrest to ensure they know they don't have to talk and can have a lawyer present. That's part of the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. \n\nBut was there another case involved? Maybe Escobedo v. Illinois? I think that was an earlier case that dealt with the right to counsel during interrogations. The Miranda case might have built on that. Let me check the details. In Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court consolidated several cases where suspects were interrogated without being informed of their rights. The Court ruled that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel required that suspects be explicitly informed of these rights before interrogation. So that's the key case. \n\nI think the answer is Miranda v. Arizona. But just to be thorough, let me think of other possibilities. There's also Mapp v. Ohio, but that was about the exclusionary rule regarding illegal searches. Gideon v. Wainwright was about the right to an attorney in criminal cases, but that's more about trials, not during interrogation. So yeah, Miranda is the one for the warnings before interrogation. So the answer should be Miranda v. Arizona.\n</think>\n\nThe case that established the precedent requiring defendants to be informed of their right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer, and protection from self-incrimination is **Miranda v. Arizona (1966)**. \n\n### Key Details:\n- **Case Name**: *Miranda v. Arizona*, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n- **Ruling**: The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel require law enforcement to inform suspects of these rights **before** custodial interrogation. This ensures individuals understand they can refuse to answer questions and have an attorney present.\n- **Context**: The decision consolidated four cases, including that of Ernesto Miranda, whose confession was deemed inadmissible because he was not informed of his rights. The Court's ruling led to the creation of the **Miranda warnings** (e.g., \"You have the right to remain silent...\").\n- **Distinguishing Other Cases**:\n  - *Escobedo v. Illinois* (1964): Preceded *Miranda* and established the right to counsel during interrogations but was narrower in scope.\n  - *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963): Guaranteed state criminal defendants the right to counsel at trial but did not address interrogation specifics.\n  - *Mapp v. Ohio* (1961): Addressed the exclusionary rule for illegal searches, unrelated to Miranda rights.\n\nThus, **Miranda v. Arizona** is the landmark case that established the requirement for police to issue the now-famous warnings."
