        "question": "Krete is an unmarried taxpayer with income exclusively from wages. By December 31, year 1, Krete's employer has withheld $16,000 in federal income taxes and Krete has made no estimated tax payments. On April 15, year 2, Krete timely filed for an extension request to file her individual tax return, and paid $300 of additional taxes. Krete's year 1 tax liability was $16,500 when she timely filed her return on April 30, year 2, and paid the remaining tax liability balance. What amount would be subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes?",
        "response": "To determine the amount subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total Tax Liability**: Krete's total tax liability for year 1 is $16,500.\n\n2. **Total Payments Made**:\n   - **Withholding by Employer**: $16,000\n   - **Additional Payment on April 15, Year 2**: $300\n   - **Remaining Payment on April 30, Year 2**: $200 (since $16,500 - $16,000 - $300 = $200)\n\n   Total payments made by April 30, Year 2: $16,000 + $300 + $200 = $16,500\n\n3. **Underpayment Calculation**:\n   - The underpayment is the difference between the total tax liability and the amount paid by the due date of the first estimated tax payment (April 15, Year 2).\n   - Amount paid by April 15, Year 2: $16,000 (withholding) + $300 (additional payment) = $16,300\n   - Underpayment: $16,500 (total liability) - $16,300 (amount paid by April 15) = $200\n\n4. **Penalty for Underpayment**:\n   - The penalty applies to the underpaid amount of $200.\n\nTherefore, the amount subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes is **$200**."
