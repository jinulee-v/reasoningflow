        "question": "How many attempts should you make to cannulate a patient before passing the job on to a senior colleague, according to the medical knowledge of 2020?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many attempts a healthcare professional should make to cannulate a patient before asking a senior colleague for help, based on 2020 medical knowledge. Let me start by recalling what I know about cannulation. Cannulation is the process of inserting a cannula into a vein, usually for administering IV fluids or medications. It's a common procedure but can be tricky depending on the patient's veins.\n\nFirst, I remember that different institutions might have their own guidelines, but there are general best practices. From what I've heard, the number of attempts can depend on factors like the patient's condition, vein accessibility, and the practitioner's skill level. But the question is about a standard number before passing it on. \n\nI think the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has guidelines on this. Maybe two attempts? Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. If a junior tries twice and fails, they should get help. That seems familiar. But why two? Maybe because multiple failed attempts can cause patient distress, pain, or complications like hematomas. Also, after a couple of tries, it's better to have someone more experienced step in to avoid further issues.\n\nI should check if there are specific guidelines from organizations like the Infusion Nurses Society (INS) or the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). The INS Standards of Practice might mention this. For example, the 2016 INS standards (which would still be relevant in 2020) recommend limiting the number of attempts to prevent patient injury and preserve veins. They might suggest no more than two attempts per clinician, then seeking assistance.\n\nAlso, considering patient safety, after two unsuccessful attempts, the risk of complications increases. So, the practitioner should call a senior. But wait, some sources say three attempts? Or maybe it's two attempts per clinician, not total. For instance, if one person tries twice, then another clinician (maybe a senior) can try, but if they also fail, then they need to consider alternative access methods.\n\nAnother angle: local hospital policies. But since the question is about 2020 medical knowledge generally, I should focus on widely accepted guidelines. The World Health Organization (WHO) might have something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, textbooks or medical journals from around 2020.\n\nWait, I recall a study or guideline that says two attempts maximum before seeking help. This is to minimize patient discomfort and potential damage. Also, the practitioner's confidence and the patient's situation matter. For example, in emergencies, maybe you have less time, but generally, sticking to two attempts is standard.\n\nBut I should verify. Let me think of possible sources. The NHS guidelines for IV access might state that after two unsuccessful attempts by one clinician, a more experienced colleague should take over. Similarly, the RCN's standards for infusion therapy mention limiting attempts to two before escalating. \n\nIn summary, the general consensus as of 2020 seems to be that a healthcare professional should attempt cannulation no more than two times before seeking assistance from a senior colleague. This helps prevent complications and reduces patient anxiety. However, this can vary based on the clinical scenario, patient factors, and institutional policies. But the standard answer is likely two attempts."
