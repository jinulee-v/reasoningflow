        "question": "Glucose is transported into the muscle cell:",
        "response": "Glucose is transported into the muscle cell by the GLUT4 transporter, which is activated by insulin. Once inside the cell, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. This reaction is irreversible and commits glucose to one of two fates: glycolysis or glycogen synthesis. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate, which can then be used for energy production in the mitochondria. Glycogen synthesis is the storage of glucose as glycogen, which can be broken down later when energy is needed. The regulation of glucose transport and metabolism in muscle cells is complex and involves multiple signaling pathways and enzymes."
