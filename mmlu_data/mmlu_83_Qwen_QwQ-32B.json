        "question": " Construct a complete truth table for the following pairs of propositions. Then, using the truth tables, determine whether the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory. If neither, determine whether they are consistent or inconsistent. Justify your answers.\nE \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) and ~E \u00b7 F",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to construct a truth table for the two propositions E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) and ~E \u00b7 F, and then determine if they are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent. Hmm, let me start by recalling what each of these terms means. \n\nFirst, logical equivalence means that the two propositions have the same truth value in every possible scenario. Contradictory would mean they have opposite truth values in every scenario. If they are neither, then they might be consistent (there's at least one scenario where both are true) or inconsistent (they can never both be true at the same time). \n\nAlright, let's start by writing out the truth table. Since both propositions involve the propositions E and F, there are two variables here, so the truth table will have 2^2 = 4 rows. The columns will be for E, F, then each of the two propositions, and maybe some intermediate steps to break them down.\n\nLet me list the rows first. The possible truth values for E and F are:\n\n1. E = T, F = T\n2. E = T, F = F\n3. E = F, F = T\n4. E = F, F = F\n\nNow, let's tackle the first proposition: E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E). The main connective here is the conditional (\u2283), so I need to compute the antecedent (E) and the consequent (F \u00b7 E) first.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nFor each row, compute F \u00b7 E first, then see if E implies that result.\n\nSimilarly, the second proposition is ~E \u00b7 F. That's a conjunction of the negation of E and F. So for each row, compute ~E and then combine it with F using conjunction.\n\nLet me start constructing the table step by step.\n\nFirst, list all the rows for E and F:\n\nRow 1: E=T, F=T\n\nRow 2: E=T, F=F\n\nRow 3: E=F, F=T\n\nRow 4: E=F, F=F\n\nNow, let's compute each part.\n\nStarting with the first proposition: E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E)\n\nFirst, compute F \u00b7 E for each row:\n\nRow 1: F=T, E=T \u2192 T \u00b7 T = T\n\nRow 2: F=F, E=T \u2192 F \u00b7 T = F\n\nRow 3: F=T, E=F \u2192 T \u00b7 F = F\n\nRow 4: F=F, E=F \u2192 F \u00b7 F = F\n\nNow, the antecedent is E, so for each row, we have E and the consequent (F \u00b7 E). The conditional E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) is true unless E is true and the consequent is false.\n\nSo let's compute that:\n\nRow 1: E=T, consequent=T \u2192 T \u2283 T = T\n\nRow 2: E=T, consequent=F \u2192 T \u2283 F = F\n\nRow 3: E=F, consequent=F \u2192 F \u2283 F = T (since if antecedent is false, the conditional is true)\n\nRow 4: E=F, consequent=F \u2192 F \u2283 F = T\n\nSo the column for E \u2283 (F \u00b7 E) is T, F, T, T.\n\nNow the second proposition: ~E \u00b7 F\n\nCompute ~E first:\n\nRow 1: ~E = F\n\nRow 2: ~E = F\n\nRow 3: ~E = T\n\nRow 4: ~E = T\n\nThen, ~E \u00b7 F is the conjunction of those with F:\n\nRow 1: F \u00b7 T = F\n\nRow 2: F \u00b7 F = F\n\nRow 3: T \u00b7 T = T\n\nRow 4: T \u00b7 F = F\n\nSo the column for ~E \u00b7 F is F, F, T, F.\n\nNow let me tabulate all this:\n\nE | F | F\u00b7E | E\u2283(F\u00b7E) | ~E | ~E\u00b7F\n---|---|-----|---------|----|-----\nT | T |  T  |    T    | F  |   F\nT | F |  F  |    F    | F  |   F\nF | T |  F  |    T    | T  |   T\nF | F |  F  |    T    | T  |   F\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the second proposition ~E \u00b7 F:\n\nRow 3: ~E is T (since E is F), and F is T, so T \u00b7 T = T. That's correct.\n\nRow 4: ~E is T, F is F, so T \u00b7 F = F. Correct.\n\nOkay, so now the columns for the two propositions are:\n\nE\u2283(F\u00b7E): T, F, T, T\n\n~E\u00b7F: F, F, T, F\n\nNow, to check for logical equivalence, we need to see if these two columns are identical. Let's compare:\n\nFirst row: T vs F \u2192 Not the same.\n\nSecond row: F vs F \u2192 Same here.\n\nThird row: T vs T \u2192 Same.\n\nFourth row: T vs F \u2192 Not the same.\n\nSo they are not the same in all rows, so they are not logically equivalent.\n\nNext, check if they are contradictory. Contradictory means that in every row, one is true and the other is false. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: E\u2283(F\u00b7E)=T, ~E\u00b7F=F \u2192 Opposite, so that's good.\n\nRow 2: Both F \u2192 Not opposite. Since both are false, they are not contradictory here.\n\nTherefore, since in row 2 both are false, they are not contradictory. Contradictory requires that they always have opposite truth values, which isn't the case here.\n\nNow, check consistency. Consistency means that there is at least one row where both are true. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\nE\u2283(F\u00b7E) and ~E\u00b7F:\n\nRow 1: T and F \u2192 Not both true.\n\nRow 2: F and F \u2192 Both false.\n\nRow 3: T and T \u2192 Both true! So yes, in row 3, both are true. Therefore, they are consistent.\n\nInconsistency would mean that there is no row where both are true, but since there is such a row (row 3), they are not inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the two propositions are consistent but neither logically equivalent nor contradictory.\n\nWait, let me just confirm once more. In row 3, when E is false and F is true, E\u2283(F\u00b7E) is T because the antecedent is false, and ~E\u00b7F is T because ~E is T and F is T. So yes, both are true here. So they can be true together, so consistent. Since they can also be false together (row 2), they are not contradictory. Since they aren't the same in all rows, not equivalent. So conclusion is consistent.\n\nHmm, but let me check if there's any other rows where they might both be true. Only row 3. But that's enough for consistency. So yes, consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that they are consistent.\n\nWait, but let me also check if there's any other possibilities. Let me recheck the truth table again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst proposition E\u2283(F\u00b7E):\n\nRow 1: E=T, F=T: F\u00b7E=T, so T\u2283T=T. Correct.\n\nRow 2: E=T, F=F: F\u00b7E=F, so T\u2283F=F. Correct.\n\nRow 3: E=F, F=T: F\u00b7E=F, so F\u2283F=T. Correct.\n\nRow 4: E=F, F=F: F\u00b7E=F, so F\u2283F=T. Correct.\n\nSecond proposition ~E\u00b7F:\n\nRow 1: ~E=F, F=T \u2192 F\u00b7T=F. Correct.\n\nRow 2: ~E=F, F=F \u2192 F\u00b7F=F. Correct.\n\nRow 3: ~E=T, F=T \u2192 T\u00b7T=T. Correct.\n\nRow 4: ~E=T, F=F \u2192 T\u00b7F=F. Correct.\n\nSo the truth table is correct. Therefore, the conclusion holds.\n\nTherefore, the two propositions are consistent because there exists at least one row (row 3) where both are true, and they are neither equivalent nor contradictory.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe statements are consistent. \\boxed{Consistent}\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the propositions \\( E \\supset (F \\cdot E) \\) and \\( \\neg E \\cdot F \\) are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent, we construct their truth tables and analyze the results.\n\nFirst, we list all possible truth values for \\( E \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cc|c|c|c|c}\nE & F & F \\cdot E & E \\supset (F \\cdot E) & \\neg E & \\neg E \\cdot F \\\\\n\\hline\nT & T & T & T & F & F \\\\\nT & F & F & F & F & F \\\\\nF & T & F & T & T & T \\\\\nF & F & F & T & T & F \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n1. **Compute \\( F \\cdot E \\):**\n   - Row 1: \\( T \\cdot T = T \\)\n   - Row 2: \\( F \\cdot T = F \\)\n   - Row 3: \\( T \\cdot F = F \\)\n   - Row 4: \\( F \\cdot F = F \\)\n\n2. **Compute \\( E \\supset (F \\cdot E) \\):**\n   - Row 1: \\( T \\supset T = T \\)\n   - Row 2: \\( T \\supset F = F \\)\n   - Row 3: \\( F \\supset F = T \\)\n   - Row 4: \\( F \\supset F = T \\)\n\n3. **Compute \\( \\neg E \\):**\n   - Row 1: \\( \\neg T = F \\)\n   - Row 2: \\( \\neg T = F \\)\n   - Row 3: \\( \\neg F = T \\)\n   - Row 4: \\( \\neg F = T \\)\n\n4. **Compute \\( \\neg E \\cdot F \\):**\n   - Row 1: \\( F \\cdot T = F \\)\n   - Row 2: \\( F \\cdot F = F \\)\n   - Row 3: \\( T \\cdot T = T \\)\n   - Row 4: \\( T \\cdot F = F \\)\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Logical Equivalence:** The columns for \\( E \\supset (F \\cdot E) \\) and \\( \\neg E \\cdot F \\) are not identical (e.g., Row 1 and Row 4 differ), so they are not logically equivalent.\n- **Contradictory:** They do not have opposite truth values in every row (e.g., Row 2 both are false), so they are not contradictory.\n- **Consistency/Inconsistency:** There exists at least one row (Row 3) where both propositions are true, so they are consistent.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe statements are consistent. \\boxed{Consistent}"
