        "question": "Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?",
        "response": "To find the greatest negative number in the set B, we need to find the ordered pairs (m, n) that satisfy the equation 7m + 12n = 22 and then calculate the sum m + n for each pair. We can start by finding the values of m and n that satisfy the equation. One way to do this is to use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 7 and 12, and then use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients of the linear combination that equals the gcd. In this case, the gcd of 7 and 12 is 1, and the coefficients are -1 and 1, respectively. Therefore, we can write the equation as 7(-1) + 12(1) = 1, and then multiply both sides by 22 to get 7(-22) + 12(22) = 22. This gives us one solution (m, n) = (-22, 22). We can then find other solutions by adding or subtracting multiples of 12 to m and subtracting or adding multiples of 7 to n, respectively. For example, we can add 12 to m and subtract 7 from n to get another solution (m, n) = (-10, 15). We can continue this process to find all the solutions, and then calculate the sum m + n for each pair. The greatest negative number in the set B will be the maximum of these sums.
