        "question": "Joe was in charge of lights for a dance. The red light blinks every two seconds, the yellow light every three seconds, and the blue light every five seconds. If we include the very beginning and very end of the dance, how many times during a seven minute dance will all the lights come on at the same time? (Assume that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very beginning of the dance.)",
        "response": "Okay, so Joe is handling the lights for a dance, and there are three different colored lights: red, yellow, and blue. Each blinks at different intervals\u2014red every 2 seconds, yellow every 3 seconds, and blue every 5 seconds. The question is asking how many times during a seven-minute dance all the lights will come on at the same time. They mention including the very beginning and very end of the dance, and they note that all three lights blink simultaneously at the very start. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out when all three lights blink together. Since they blink at different intervals, this is a problem about finding common multiples of those intervals. Specifically, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, and 5 seconds. Once we have that LCM, we can determine how many times within seven minutes this common multiple occurs, including both the start and the end times.\n\nLet me recall, the LCM of several numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers. So, for 2, 3, and 5, since these are all prime numbers, the LCM would just be their product. Let me check that. 2 times 3 is 6, and 6 times 5 is 30. So, LCM(2, 3, 5) = 30 seconds. That means every 30 seconds, all three lights will blink together. Is that right? Let me verify. If red blinks every 2 seconds, then at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 30 seconds. Yellow every 3 seconds: 0, 3, 6, 9, ..., 30 seconds. Blue every 5 seconds: 0, 5, 10, 15, ..., 30 seconds. So, 30 seconds is indeed the first time after 0 that they all blink together. So, every 30 seconds, they all blink together.\n\nNow, the dance lasts seven minutes. Let me convert that into seconds to make the units match. Since one minute is 60 seconds, seven minutes is 7 * 60 = 420 seconds. So, the dance lasts 420 seconds. We need to find how many times all three lights blink together from 0 seconds up to and including 420 seconds.\n\nSince the LCM is 30 seconds, the times when all three blink together are at 0, 30, 60, 90, ..., up to 420 seconds. This is an arithmetic sequence starting at 0, with a common difference of 30 seconds. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number. Here, a_1 = 0, d = 30, and we need to find n such that a_n = 420.\n\nPlugging into the formula: 420 = 0 + (n - 1)*30. Solving for n: (n - 1)*30 = 420 => n - 1 = 420 / 30 = 14 => n = 15. So, there are 15 times when all three lights blink together. Wait, but let me check this again. If the first time is at 0 seconds, then the next at 30, then 60, ..., up to 420. Let's count them:\n\n0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360, 390, 420. That's 15 instances. So, starting at 0, adding 30 each time, and ending at 420. So, 15 times total. Therefore, the answer should be 15.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let's verify with another method. The total duration is 420 seconds. The LCM is 30 seconds, so the number of intervals is 420 / 30 = 14. But since we include both the start and the end, it's 14 + 1 = 15. Yes, that matches. So, 14 intervals of 30 seconds each, which gives 14*30 = 420 seconds, and adding 1 to include the starting point, gives 15 total blinks. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I list them out:\n\n1. 0 seconds (start)\n2. 30 seconds\n3. 60 seconds\n4. 90 seconds\n5. 120 seconds\n6. 150 seconds\n7. 180 seconds\n8. 210 seconds\n9. 240 seconds\n10. 270 seconds\n11. 300 seconds\n12. 330 seconds\n13. 360 seconds\n14. 390 seconds\n15. 420 seconds (end)\n\nYep, that's 15 times. So, the answer is 15. Therefore, during a seven-minute dance, all the lights come on at the same time 15 times, including the beginning and the end.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 420 seconds is indeed a multiple of 30. 30*14 = 420, so yes, 420 is the 14th multiple after 0. So, starting at 0, the multiples are 0, 30, 60, ..., 420. So, 0 is the first, 30 the second, ..., 420 is the 15th. So, 15 in total.\n\nAlternatively, if we model the problem as events occurring at LCM intervals, the number of events is floor(total time / LCM) + 1. But here, total time is exactly divisible by LCM, so it's (420 / 30) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15. So, that formula works here. If the total time wasn't a multiple of LCM, we would take the floor division and add 1 for the initial event.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 15. Let me just check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, could there be an overlap where another common multiple is found? But since LCM is 30, and 30 is the smallest common multiple, all other common multiples are multiples of 30. So, up to 420, which is 14*30, so all multiples are accounted for. Therefore, 15 times in total. So, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of times all the lights come on at the same time during the dance is \\boxed{15}."
