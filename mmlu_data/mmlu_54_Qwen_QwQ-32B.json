        "question": "The muon decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this question about muon decay and why it can't decay into just an electron and a single neutrino. The question mentions that the muon's characteristic lifetime is about 1e-6 seconds, and normally it decays into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. But why can't it just decay into an electron and one neutrino? The answer has to do with a conservation law. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in particle physics, certain conservation laws must be obeyed in any interaction or decay. The main ones are conservation of charge, lepton number, energy, momentum, angular momentum (spin), and maybe others like baryon number, but in this case, since we're dealing with leptons, lepton numbers might be key here.\n\nLet me start by recalling the standard muon decay process. A muon (\u03bc\u207b) decays into an electron (e\u207b), a muon neutrino (\u03bd_\u03bc), and an electron antineutrino (\u03bd\u0304_e). The reaction is: \u03bc\u207b \u2192 e\u207b + \u03bd_\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304_e. \n\nNow, the question is why can't it decay into just an electron and a single neutrino? Let's consider the possible options. If it were to decay into an electron and one neutrino, the reaction would be \u03bc\u207b \u2192 e\u207b + \u03bd. But which neutrino? Since neutrinos come in flavors corresponding to their charged leptons, maybe \u03bd_\u03bc or \u03bd_e? Let me check the conservation laws for each possibility.\n\nFirst, let's check charge conservation. The muon has charge -1. The electron also has charge -1. A neutrino is neutral, so if the decay were \u03bc\u207b \u2192 e\u207b + \u03bd, the total charge would be -1 (electron) + 0 (neutrino) = -1, which matches the initial charge of the muon. So charge is conserved here. Hmm, so charge isn't the issue.\n\nNext, lepton number conservation. Each lepton flavor has its own lepton number. For muons, the muon lepton number (L_\u03bc) is +1 for the muon, -1 for the antimuon, etc. Similarly, electron lepton number (L_e) is +1 for electrons, -1 for positrons, etc. Neutrinos carry lepton number as well: \u03bd_\u03bc has L_\u03bc = +1, \u03bd_e has L_e = +1, and their antineutrinos have -1.\n\nIn the standard decay, the muon (L_\u03bc = +1, L_e = 0) decays into an electron (L_e = +1), a muon neutrino (L_\u03bc = +1), and an electron antineutrino (L_e = -1). Let's check the lepton numbers:\n\n- L_\u03bc: Initial is +1 (muon). Final: \u03bd_\u03bc has +1, others have 0. So total L_\u03bc is +1. That's conserved.\n\n- L_e: Initial is 0. Final: electron has +1, electron antineutrino has -1. Total L_e is 0. So that's conserved.\n\nNow, if the decay were \u03bc\u207b \u2192 e\u207b + \u03bd, let's see what happens. Let's suppose the neutrino is a muon neutrino (\u03bd_\u03bc). Then:\n\n- L_\u03bc: Initial +1. Final: \u03bd_\u03bc gives +1, electron has 0. Total L_\u03bc = +1. That's okay.\n\n- L_e: Initial 0. Final: electron has +1, neutrino has 0. Total L_e = +1. That's not conserved. So that's a problem. The electron lepton number would increase by 1, which isn't allowed.\n\nAlternatively, if the neutrino is an electron neutrino (\u03bd_e):\n\n- L_\u03bc: Initial +1. Final: neutrino has 0, so total L_\u03bc = 0. Not conserved. So that's bad.\n\nIf the neutrino is an electron antineutrino (\u03bd\u0304_e):\n\n- L_\u03bc: Still 0 in final, so L_\u03bc not conserved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a tau neutrino? But that's even worse because it would involve a different lepton flavor which isn't present here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the neutrino is an antineutrino of some sort? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the neutrino has to be an antineutrino? Let me see. Let's try with \u03bd\u0304_\u03bc (muon antineutrino):\n\nThen:\n\n- L_\u03bc: Initial +1. Final: \u03bd\u0304_\u03bc has -1, so total L_\u03bc = -1. Not conserved.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, if the neutrino is an electron antineutrino (\u03bd\u0304_e):\n\n- L_e: electron has +1, \u03bd\u0304_e has -1. So L_e total is 0. That's okay.\n\n- L_\u03bc: Initial +1. Final: neutrino has 0, so L_\u03bc is 0. Not conserved.\n\nSo in any case, if we have only one neutrino, either the muon lepton number or the electron lepton number isn't conserved. Therefore, to conserve both lepton numbers, you need two neutrinos: one to carry away the muon lepton number and another to handle the electron lepton number.\n\nWait, in the standard decay, the muon neutrino carries +1 L_\u03bc, and the electron antineutrino carries -1 L_e. The electron has +1 L_e. So overall, L_e is 0 (from +1 and -1), and L_\u03bc is +1 (from the neutrino). So that works.\n\nTherefore, if you only have one neutrino, you can't conserve both lepton numbers. For example, if you have a muon neutrino and an electron, then L_e would be +1, which isn't balanced. If you have an electron antineutrino, then L_\u03bc is lost. So you need both a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino to conserve both lepton numbers.\n\nTherefore, the law of conservation of lepton number (specifically, conservation of muon lepton number and electron lepton number) forbids the decay into just an electron and a single neutrino. That must be the answer.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the law of conservation of...\", so maybe it's referring to a specific conservation law. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, could it be conservation of angular momentum or spin? The muon has spin 1/2, the electron also spin 1/2, and neutrinos are spin 1/2 as well. The total spin before and after must be conserved. But in the decay, the three particles can have their spins adding up appropriately. However, maybe with only two particles, the spins can't add up correctly? Let me think.\n\nThe muon is a lepton with spin 1/2. The decay products must also have total spin 1/2. If you have two fermions (electron and neutrino), each with spin 1/2, their total spin can be 0 or 1. But the initial state is 1/2, so you need the final state to have spin 1/2. To get spin 1/2 from two spin 1/2 particles, you can have either triplet (total spin 1) or singlet (total spin 0). Neither of which equals 1/2. Therefore, you need an odd number of fermions to get a half-integer total spin. Wait, three fermions can have total spin 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2, but actually, the spins can combine in different ways. Hmm, maybe this is a consideration?\n\nWait, actually, the total angular momentum must be conserved. The muon has spin 1/2. The decay products must have a total angular momentum of 1/2. If you have two particles, their total angular momentum can be 0 or 1 (if they are both spin 1/2). So you can't get 1/2. Therefore, you need an odd number of particles with half-integer spin to get a half-integer total. Since three particles can have spins adding to 1/2 (for example, two with spin 1/2 adding to 1, then adding the third 1/2 to get 1/2 or 3/2, but maybe there's a way). Wait, actually, three spin 1/2 particles can have total spin 3/2, 1/2, etc. So maybe that's possible. Hmm, perhaps this is a more complicated consideration. But I think the lepton number conservation is the primary reason here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's conservation of energy? But in the rest frame of the muon, the total energy must be equal to the muon's rest mass energy. The electron and neutrino would have to carry away that energy. But neutrinos are relativistic, so maybe possible? Not sure. But energy conservation is generally a given as long as the particles' energies add up, but maybe momentum?\n\nWait, momentum conservation. In the rest frame of the muon, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. If you have two particles, their momenta must be equal and opposite. But neutrinos are neutral and have very small mass (maybe considered massless?), so their momentum is E/c. The electron has a significant mass. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the muon is at rest. Then the electron and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the electron's momentum as p and the neutrino's as -p. The energy of the electron would be sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy would be pc (assuming massless). The total energy must equal the muon's rest energy, m_mu c\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 ) + pc = m_mu c\u00b2\n\nThis equation might have a solution. Let me see numerically. Let me plug in some numbers. The muon mass is about 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2, electron is 0.511 MeV/c\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote variables without c for simplicity (using natural units where c=1):\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m_e\u00b2) + p = m_mu\n\nLet me let x = p. Then:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + m_e\u00b2) + x = m_mu\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + m_e\u00b2) = m_mu - x\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + m_e\u00b2 = m_mu\u00b2 - 2 m_mu x + x\u00b2\n\nCancel x\u00b2:\n\nm_e\u00b2 = m_mu\u00b2 - 2 m_mu x\n\nThen:\n\n2 m_mu x = m_mu\u00b2 - m_e\u00b2\n\nx = (m_mu\u00b2 - m_e\u00b2)/(2 m_mu)\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\nm_mu \u2248 105.7 MeV, m_e \u2248 0.511 MeV\n\nSo,\n\nx \u2248 ( (105.7)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / (2 * 105.7 )\n\n\u2248 (11172.49 - 0.261) / 211.4\n\n\u2248 11172.229 / 211.4 \u2248 ~52.85 MeV/c\n\nSo the momentum would be about 52.85 MeV/c. Then the energy of the electron would be sqrt( (52.85)^2 + (0.511)^2 ) \u2248 sqrt(2793 + 0.26) \u2248 ~52.85 MeV (since the electron mass is negligible here). Wait, but then the total energy would be 52.85 (electron) + 52.85 (neutrino) \u2248 105.7 MeV, which matches the muon's rest mass. So actually, this is possible? So momentum conservation doesn't forbid it?\n\nHmm, so maybe momentum is okay. Then why can't it decay into two particles? The problem must be lepton numbers. Because when I considered the lepton numbers earlier, it seems that you can't conserve both muon and electron lepton numbers with only two particles. Let me confirm again.\n\nIn the decay \u03bc\u207b \u2192 e\u207b + \u03bd, let's suppose the neutrino is a muon neutrino (\u03bd_\u03bc). Then:\n\n- L_\u03bc: Initial +1. Final: \u03bd_\u03bc has +1, so total L_\u03bc is +1. That's okay.\n\n- L_e: Initial 0. Final: e\u207b has +1, neutrino has 0. So total L_e is +1. Not conserved. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, if the neutrino is an electron antineutrino (\u03bd\u0304_e):\n\n- L_e: e\u207b has +1, \u03bd\u0304_e has -1. Total L_e = 0. Good.\n\n- L_\u03bc: Initial +1. Final: neutrino has 0. So L_\u03bc becomes 0. Not conserved. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, if the neutrino is a tau neutrino? But that's irrelevant here since there's no tau lepton involved. So that would introduce a new lepton flavor which isn't present, making it worse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the neutrino is an antineutrino of muon? Then \u03bd\u0304_\u03bc:\n\n- L_\u03bc: Initial +1. Final: \u03bd\u0304_\u03bc has -1. Total L_\u03bc = 0. Not conserved.\n\nHmm. So in all cases, either L_\u03bc or L_e isn't conserved. Therefore, you need two neutrinos to carry away the lepton numbers appropriately. The muon neutrino takes care of the muon lepton number, and the electron antineutrino cancels the electron's lepton number. So that's why three particles are needed.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be conservation of lepton number. But the question says \"the law of conservation of...\", so maybe they are referring to a specific one. Wait, but lepton number is a combination of different flavors. Since each lepton flavor has its own conservation, you can't just have total lepton number; you have to conserve each individually. So the decay must conserve both muon lepton number and electron lepton number. Since the muon has L_\u03bc = +1 and L_e = 0, the decay products must also have L_\u03bc = +1 and L_e = 0. \n\nIn the case of two particles, you can't get both. For example, if you have an electron (L_e +1) and a muon neutrino (L_\u03bc +1), then L_e becomes +1, which is not conserved. Alternatively, an electron and an electron antineutrino would give L_e = 0, but then L_\u03bc is 0. So you need both a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino to get L_\u03bc = +1 and L_e = 0. Hence, three particles are necessary.\n\nTherefore, the law in question is the conservation of lepton number, specifically the individual conservation of muon and electron lepton numbers. Since the problem mentions \"the law of conservation of...\", maybe they are referring to lepton number conservation. Alternatively, sometimes people refer to \"lepton family number\" conservation, but in the Standard Model, lepton flavor is not absolutely conserved (due to neutrino oscillations), but in the decay process, the interaction is via the weak force, which conserves lepton flavor. Wait, actually in the Standard Model, the charged current interactions conserve lepton flavor. The muon decay is a charged current interaction where the muon turns into an electron, but that would violate muon number and electron number unless there's a corresponding neutrino to balance it. \n\nWait, actually, in the Standard Model, the charged current interactions do conserve lepton flavor. The muon decay is a charged current process where the muon emits a W\u207b boson, which then decays into an electron and an antineutrino. The muon neutrino comes from the other side of the interaction? Hmm, maybe I need to think about the Feynman diagram.\n\nThe Feynman diagram for muon decay has the muon emitting a W\u207b boson, which then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino. Meanwhile, the muon neutrino is emitted from the muon's side? Wait, actually, no. Let me recall: the muon (\u03bc\u207b) interacts via the weak force, so the muon turns into a muon neutrino (\u03bd_\u03bc) by emitting a W\u207b boson. The W\u207b then decays into an electron (e\u207b) and an electron antineutrino (\u03bd\u0304_e). So in the diagram, the W\u207b is the intermediate boson. Therefore, the vertices must conserve lepton flavor. At the vertex where the muon becomes the neutrino and the W\u207b, the muon lepton number is conserved because the muon (L_\u03bc=+1) turns into a muon neutrino (L_\u03bc=+1) and the W\u207b (which has no lepton number). Then the W\u207b decays into an electron (L_e=+1) and an electron antineutrino (L_e=-1), so that vertex conserves electron lepton number (0 on the left, +1 -1 = 0 on the right). \n\nTherefore, each vertex conserves lepton flavor. Hence, the overall process must conserve both muon and electron lepton numbers. Therefore, if you tried to have only two particles, you can't have both lepton numbers conserved. Hence, the decay must produce three particles to conserve both lepton numbers. \n\nTherefore, the answer is conservation of lepton number (specifically, conservation of muon and electron lepton numbers). The question might be expecting the answer \"lepton number\" or \"lepton family number\". Since the question says \"the law of conservation of...\", maybe it's just \"lepton number\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are referring to conservation of charge? But charge is conserved in both cases. Wait, in the two-particle decay, charge is conserved as we saw earlier. So that's not it.\n\nAnother possibility is conservation of energy and momentum, but as I calculated earlier, that seems possible. So probably lepton number is the key here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be conservation of lepton number. The muon has a muon lepton number of +1 and an electron lepton number of 0. To conserve these, the decay products must also have a total muon lepton number of +1 and electron lepton number of 0. With three particles, this is possible (\u03bd_\u03bc gives +1 muon, e\u207b gives +1 electron, \u03bd\u0304_e gives -1 electron), balancing out. With two particles, you can't balance both numbers. Hence, the decay into two particles is forbidden by lepton number conservation.\n</think>\n\nThe muon decay into an electron and a single neutrino is forbidden by the **conservation of lepton number**. Specifically, the decay must conserve both muon lepton number (\\(L_\\mu\\)) and electron lepton number (\\(L_e\\)).\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Muon Decay Process**:\n   - The standard decay is \\(\\mu^- \\to e^- + \\nu_\\mu + \\overline{\\nu}_e\\).\n   - **Lepton Numbers**:\n     - Initial: \\(L_\\mu = +1\\) (muon), \\(L_e = 0\\).\n     - Final:\n       - \\(L_\\mu = +1\\) (from \\(\\nu_\\mu\\)),\n       - \\(L_e = +1\\) (from \\(e^-\\)) \\(-1\\) (from \\(\\overline{\\nu}_e\\)) = \\(0\\).\n   - Both \\(L_\\mu\\) and \\(L_e\\) are conserved.\n\n2. **Two-Particle Decay (\\(\\mu^- \\to e^- + \\nu\\))**:\n   - Suppose the neutrino is a **muon neutrino (\\(\\nu_\\mu\\))**:\n     - \\(L_\\mu = +1\\) (conserved), but \\(L_e = +1\\) (from \\(e^-\\)), violating \\(L_e\\) conservation.\n   - Suppose the neutrino is an **electron antineutrino (\\(\\overline{\\nu}_e\\))**:\n     - \\(L_e = 0\\) (from \\(e^- + \\overline{\\nu}_e\\)), but \\(L_\\mu = 0\\) (no \\(\\nu_\\mu\\)), violating \\(L_\\mu\\) conservation.\n   - Any other neutrino (e.g., \\(\\nu_e\\) or \\(\\overline{\\nu}_\\mu\\)) would similarly fail to conserve both lepton numbers.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - To conserve **both** \\(L_\\mu\\) and \\(L_e\\), the decay requires **three particles**: the electron (\\(e^-\\)), a muon neutrino (\\(\\nu_\\mu\\)), and an electron antineutrino (\\(\\overline{\\nu}_e\\)).

A two-particle decay cannot satisfy both conservation laws simultaneously.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe muon decay into an electron and a single neutrino is forbidden by the **conservation of lepton number**. Specifically, the decay must conserve both muon (\\(L_\\mu\\)) and electron (\\(L_e\\)) lepton numbers, which requires three particles in the final state. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{lepton number}}",
