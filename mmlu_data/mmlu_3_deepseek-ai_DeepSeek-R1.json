        "question": "Statement 1| Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. Statement 2 | Every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true or not. Let me start with Statement 1: \"Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one.\" Hmm, okay. Let me recall some basic set theory and functions. \n\nFirst, a function is onto, or surjective, if every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain. Since the domain and codomain are the same finite set here, we're talking about a surjective function from a finite set to itself. The statement claims that such a function must also be injective, meaning one-to-one. \n\nI remember that for finite sets, injective, surjective, and bijective functions are related in a specific way. If the domain and codomain are finite and have the same number of elements, then a function is injective if and only if it is surjective. So, if the function is onto, it must also be one-to-one, and vice versa. \n\nWait, let me verify that. Suppose we have a finite set S with n elements. If a function f: S \u2192 S is surjective, then since all n elements are covered, and the domain has n elements, each element must be hit exactly once. Otherwise, if some element were hit more than once, then another element would have to be missed, right? Because there's only n elements to map from. So, if you have a surjective function on a finite set, you can't have two different elements in the domain mapping to the same element in the codomain, because then you'd run out of elements to cover the rest. \n\nLet me think of a concrete example. Suppose S = {1, 2, 3}. If I define a function f: S \u2192 S that is surjective but not injective. Let's try f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 2. Wait, is this surjective? The image is {1, 2}, but the codomain is {1, 2, 3}. So, no, that's not surjective. To be surjective, every element in the codomain must be mapped to. So maybe f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1. Again, image is {1, 2}, not surjective. \n\nWait, maybe if I try f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 3. That's bijective. If I try to make a surjective function that's not injective, maybe map two elements to the same target. But then, as in the previous examples, the image becomes smaller. So, perhaps in a finite set, if the function is surjective, you can't have two elements mapping to the same element because you need to cover all elements. So, injective and surjective are equivalent for functions from a finite set to itself. \n\nTherefore, Statement 1 should be true. \n\nNow moving on to Statement 2: \"Every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian.\" Let me recall group theory. An abelian group is a group where the operation is commutative. A subgroup is a subset of the group that is itself a group under the same operation. \n\nSo, if the larger group is abelian, then any subgroup must also be abelian because the operation's commutativity is inherited. Let me think. Suppose G is an abelian group, and H is a subgroup of G. Take any two elements a, b in H. Since H is a subset of G, a and b are also in G. Because G is abelian, ab = ba. But since the operation in H is the same as in G, then in H, ab = ba as well. Therefore, H is abelian. \n\nTherefore, Statement 2 should also be true. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's any possible way a subgroup of an abelian group could fail to be abelian. But since the operation is commutative in the entire group, any subset would have elements that commute. Unless the operation isn't associative or something, but subgroups inherit associativity from the larger group. So, yeah, subgroups of abelian groups are abelian. \n\nSo both statements seem to be true. Wait, but let me check again for Statement 1. Maybe I made a mistake there. Suppose we have a function from a finite set to itself that is surjective but not injective. Wait, but in finite sets, the pigeonhole principle says that if you have a function from a set with n elements to another set with n elements, if it's surjective, it must be injective. Because if you map each of the n elements, and you have n elements to map to, you can't have two elements mapping to the same thing without missing some element. \n\nYes, exactly. So in finite sets, injective, surjective, and bijective are equivalent. So Statement 1 is true. \n\nTherefore, both statements are true. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I confused something. \n\nWait, Statement 1 says \"Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one.\" So onto implies one-to-one. Yes, in finite sets, that's correct. For example, if you have a function f: {1,2,3} \u2192 {1,2,3} that's surjective, then it must be injective. If it's not injective, then two elements map to the same element, so the third element can't cover the remaining two elements. Wait, no, if two elements map to the same element, then the images would be at most two elements, so the function wouldn't be surjective. Therefore, surjective implies injective. \n\nSimilarly, injective implies surjective. So yes, Statement 1 is correct. \n\nAnd Statement 2, subgroups of abelian groups are abelian. Since the operation is commutative in the whole group, it remains commutative in any subset closed under the operation. Therefore, Statement 2 is correct. \n\nSo both statements are true. But wait, maybe I need to check if there's a case where a subgroup could be non-abelian. But in an abelian group, every element commutes with every other element. So in any subgroup, elements still commute. Therefore, the subgroup must be abelian. \n\nTherefore, both statements are true. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBoth statements are true, so the answer is \\boxed{A}."
