        "question": "In order to become securitized, a threat must be presented in which of these ways?",
        "response": "For a threat to become securitized, it must be presented in a specific way that elevates it to a level of existential urgency, requiring extraordinary measures to address it. This process is often referred to as **securitization** in international relations and security studies. The key elements of securitization include:\n\n1. **Speech Act**: A securitizing actor (e.g., a government, leader, or organization) must frame the threat as an existential danger to a referent object (e.g., the state, society, or a group). This is typically done through rhetoric or discourse that emphasizes the severity and immediacy of the threat.\n\n2. **Existential Threat**: The threat must be portrayed as posing an existential risk to the survival or identity of the referent object. This means it is not just a routine or manageable issue but something that could fundamentally undermine the entity in question.\n\n3. **Extraordinary Measures**: The securitizing actor must argue that normal political procedures are insufficient to address the threat and that extraordinary measures (e.g., emergency laws, military action, or significant resource allocation) are necessary.\n\n4. **Audience Acceptance**: The audience (e.g., the public, policymakers, or international community) must accept the framing of the threat as existential and agree to the need for extraordinary measures. Without this acceptance, the securitization process fails.\n\nIn summary, a threat becomes securitized when it is presented as an existential danger through a speech act, and the audience agrees that extraordinary measures are required to address it."
