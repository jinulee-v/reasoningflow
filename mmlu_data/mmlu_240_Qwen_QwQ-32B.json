        "question": "A state legislature has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor to curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer perfonning his duties. A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, \"Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. \" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The strongest constitutional argument for the student is that",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the strongest constitutional argument the student can make against the state statute that makes it a misdemeanor to curse or use obscene language towards a police officer performing their duties. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the student is protesting the war on campus, which is protected speech under the First Amendment. He also sewed the American flag to his jeans as a form of protest, which might be symbolic speech. The police officer tells him to remove the flag or get arrested. The student then curses at the officer, calling him a \"bastard\" and referring to the flag as a \"rag,\" leading to his arrest under the statute.\n\nThe question is about the strongest constitutional argument here. The key points are the student's speech (both the verbal outburst and the symbolic speech with the flag) and the state's statute restricting that speech when directed at police officers.\n\nFirst, I should consider the First Amendment protections. The Supreme Court has ruled that speech cannot be restricted based on its content unless it falls into a specific exception, like fighting words, obscenity, incitement, etc. The statute here is targeting speech directed at police officers, which might be content-based. Content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, meaning the state must show a compelling government interest and that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nThe student's verbal outburst (\"you bastard\") could be considered \"fighting words,\" which are not protected under the First Amendment. The classic case here is Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, where the Court held that fighting words are those that \"inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\" However, the definition of fighting words has been narrowed over time. For example, in Cohen v. California, the Court protected the wearing of a jacket with \"Fuck the Draft\" as symbolic speech, indicating that offensive language alone might not always qualify as fighting words.\n\nAnother angle is the overbreadth of the statute. If the statute is too broad and prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech, it might be struck down. The statute here prohibits \"curse or revile or use obscene or opprobrious language toward or in reference to a police officer.\" The terms \"revile\" and \"opprobrious\" might be vague and could encompass a lot of protected speech. Overbreadth doctrine allows courts to invalidate laws that inhibit constitutionally protected expression.\n\nAdditionally, the statute might be viewpoint-based. The student's speech was directed at the police officer in the context of a protest, which is a matter of public concern. The state can't target speech based on its viewpoint. If the statute is specifically targeting speech critical of police officers, that could be a problem.\n\nThe symbolic speech aspect (the flag sewn to jeans) might also be relevant. In Texas v. Johnson, the Court held that burning the flag as symbolic speech is protected. The student's use of the flag here is similar, so the officer's demand to remove it might be an overreach, but the immediate issue is the arrest for the verbal outburst.\n\nHowever, the key here is the arrest for using offensive language towards the officer. The student's argument would likely focus on the statute being an unconstitutional content-based restriction on speech. Even if the words used are considered fighting words, the Supreme Court has been inconsistent on this. In cases like Snyder v. Phelps, the Court protected offensive protests near funerals, suggesting that offensive speech is still protected unless it's fighting words.\n\nAlternatively, the statute might be seen as a content-based restriction that isn't narrowly tailored. The state's interest in protecting police officers from offensive speech might not be compelling enough, especially since officers are expected to handle such speech as part of their duties. In City of Houston v. Hill, the Court struck down a statute that prohibited interfering with a police officer by \"opprobrious words,\" finding it too broad and violating the First Amendment because it allowed officers to arrest based on their subjective reactions.\n\nSo, putting this together, the strongest argument is probably that the statute is an unconstitutional content-based restriction on speech, violating the First Amendment. The student's speech, even if offensive, is protected unless it falls into an exception like fighting words. The statute's broad terms (revile, opprobrious) might not meet the narrow tailoring required, and the state's interest in protecting officers from such speech isn't compelling enough, especially since officers are in a public role. Additionally, the statute could be overbroad, restricting more speech than necessary. The case of Hill is particularly relevant here, where the Court invalidated a similar statute because it allowed arrests based on speech directed at police without sufficient justification.\n</think>\n\nThe strongest constitutional argument the student can assert is that the state statute violates the First Amendment by imposing an unconstitutional content-based restriction on speech. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the argument:\n\n### 1. **Content-Based Restriction Subject to Strict Scrutiny**\n   - The statute explicitly targets speech based on its content (directed at police officers and containing \"curse[s],\" \"revile,\" or \"opprobrious language\"). Content-based restrictions are generally subject to **strict scrutiny**, requiring the state to demonstrate a **compelling governmental interest** and that the law is **narrowly tailored** to achieve that interest.\n   - The state\u2019s asserted interest in protecting police officers from offensive language is likely insufficient to meet this standard. Police officers, by virtue of their public role, are expected to endure criticism and harsh language as part of their duties. Courts have held that officers cannot claim special protection from speech that would otherwise be constitutionally protected (e.g., *City of Houston v. Hill*, 482 U.S. 451 (1987)).\n\n### 2. **Overbreadth and Vagueness**\n   - The statute\u2019s terms\u2014such as \"revile\" and \"opprobrious\"\u2014are **overbroad** and **vague**, encompassing a substantial amount of protected speech. Overbreadth doctrine allows courts to invalidate laws that prohibit more speech than necessary, even if some applications might be constitutional. For example, criticizing police policies or using strong rhetoric in protests could fall under these terms, chilling protected expression.\n   - The statute\u2019s broad language also fails the **narrow tailoring** requirement. It does not distinguish between speech that poses a genuine threat to public safety (e.g., incitement to imminent violence) and mere offensive language, which is protected unless it qualifies as \"fighting words.\"\n\n### 3. **Fighting Words Exception Narrowly Construed**\n   - While the student\u2019s use of \"bastard\" might seem like \"fighting words,\" the Supreme Court has narrowed this exception significantly. In *Cohen v. California* (1971), the Court protected offensive speech (\"Fuck the Draft\") as symbolic expression, emphasizing that mere vulgarity or offensiveness does not automatically render speech unprotected. Similarly, in *Snyder v. Phelps* (2011), the Court upheld the right to protest with offensive speech near a funeral, stressing that public discourse must tolerate \"even hurtful speech on public issues.\"\n   - The student\u2019s outburst was part of a broader protest against the war and government policies, implicating matters of **public concern**. Such speech is entitled to heightened protection, and the statute\u2019s prohibition on \"opprobrious language\" toward police officers risks suppressing core political speech.\n\n### 4. **Viewpoint Discrimination**\n   - The statute could be interpreted as **viewpoint-based**, as it selectively targets speech critical of police officers. The First Amendment prohibits laws that restrict speech based on the speaker\u2019s viewpoint, particularly on matters of public importance. The student\u2019s protest against the war and the government\u2019s actions (symbolized by the flag) is a classic example of protected political speech.\n\n### 5. **Relevance of *City of Houston v. Hill* (1987)**\n   - In *Hill*, the Court struck down a statute prohibiting \"intentionally prevent[ing], delay[ing], or obstruct[ing] a police officer\" by using \"opprobrious words or language.\" The Court held that the law impermissibly criminalized speech directed at police officers without requiring proof that the speech posed a threat to public safety or interfered with police duties. The statute here is analogous, as it criminalizes offensive language toward officers without demonstrating a nexus to harm or obstruction.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe student\u2019s strongest argument is that the statute is an **unconstitutional content-based restriction** on speech, violating the First Amendment. It fails strict scrutiny because the state\u2019s interest in shielding officers from offensive language is not compelling, and the law is neither narrowly tailored nor sufficiently precise. Additionally, the statute\u2019s overbreadth and potential for viewpoint discrimination further undermine its constitutionality. The student\u2019s protest speech, even when harsh or critical, is protected unless it falls into a narrowly defined exception like incitement or true threats, which it does not here."
