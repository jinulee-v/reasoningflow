        "question": "Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. Let me write that down step by step to make sure I get all the layers right. The expression is \u221a(\u00b3\u221a(\u221a(1/729))). Hmm, that's a lot of roots nested inside each other. Let me break it down starting from the inside.\n\nFirst, the innermost part is \u221a(1/729). The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 729... wait, what's the square root of 729? Let me think. 27 times 27 is 729, right? Because 25 squared is 625, 30 squared is 900, so 27 squared is 729. So \u221a729 is 27. Therefore, \u221a(1/729) is \u221a1 divided by \u221a729, which is 1/27. Okay, so the innermost square root simplifies to 1/27.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have the cube root of that result. So \u00b3\u221a(1/27). The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 27 is 3, because 3^3 is 27. So \u00b3\u221a(1/27) is 1/3. Alright, so now we've simplified the cube root part to 1/3.\n\nNext, the outermost layer is the square root of that result. So \u221a(1/3). The square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 3 is irrational, so \u221a(1/3) is equal to 1/\u221a3. But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. Right now, we have 1 over the square root of 3, which is not rational. To rationalize the denominator, we need to eliminate the square root in the denominator.\n\nThe standard way to rationalize 1/\u221a3 is to multiply the numerator and the denominator by \u221a3. That way, the denominator becomes \u221a3 * \u221a3 = 3, and the numerator becomes 1 * \u221a3 = \u221a3. So, 1/\u221a3 is equivalent to \u221a3/3. Therefore, \u221a(1/3) simplifies to \u221a3/3, which has a rational denominator.\n\nLet me recap all the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with the innermost radical: \u221a(1/729) = 1/27.\n2. Take the cube root of 1/27: \u00b3\u221a(1/27) = 1/3.\n3. Take the square root of 1/3: \u221a(1/3) = 1/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3 after rationalizing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the original expression simplifies to \u221a3 over 3. Let me check if each step makes sense.\n\nFirst, confirming \u221a729 is 27. Yes, 27*27 is 729. Then, cube root of 1/27 is indeed 1/3 because (1/3)^3 = 1/27. Then square root of 1/3 is 1/\u221a3, which rationalizes to \u221a3/3. That all checks out.\n\nWait, but let me verify another way by expressing all the roots as exponents. Maybe that could be a quicker method or confirm my result.\n\nThe original expression is \u221a(\u00b3\u221a(\u221a(1/729))). Let's rewrite each root as a fractional exponent:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n\u221a(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2)\n\nThen, the cube root of that is [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3) = (1/729)^(1/6)\n\nThen, the square root of that is [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/6 * 1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12)\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to (1/729)^(1/12). Now, let's see if we can express 729 as a power of a number to simplify this exponent.\n\n729 is a familiar number. Let me recall: 9^3 = 729, because 9*9=81, 81*9=729. Also, 3^6 = 729, since 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729. So 729 is 3^6. Therefore, 1/729 is 3^(-6).\n\nSo substituting back, (1/729)^(1/12) = (3^(-6))^(1/12) = 3^(-6 * 1/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/3^(1/2) = 1/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3 after rationalizing. So that confirms the previous result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the simplified form is \u221a3/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \u221a3 over 3. Let me just check once more to ensure I didn't make any exponent rules mistakes.\n\nOriginal expression as exponents: (( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) )^(1/2) = (1/729)^(1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2) = (1/729)^(1/12). Then, since 729 is 3^6, so (3^6)^(1/12) = 3^(6/12) = 3^(1/2) = \u221a3. Wait, hold on, wait a second. Wait, if (1/729)^(1/12) is equal to 3^(-6 * 1/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/\u221a3. But if I consider 729 as 3^6, then (3^6)^(1/12) is 3^(6/12) = 3^(1/2) = \u221a3. But here, 1/729 is 3^(-6), so (3^(-6))^(1/12) is 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/\u221a3. So that's correct. So \u221a3/3 is the same as 1/\u221a3, but rationalized. So both ways, exponent approach and step-by-step root simplification, lead to the same answer. Therefore, confident that \u221a3/3 is the correct simplified form with a rational denominator.\n\nJust to recap in another way: Let's express all the operations step by step using exponents.\n\n1. Innermost: \u221a(1/729) = (1/729)^(1/2) = 1^(1/2)/729^(1/2) = 1/27.\n2. Next layer: \u00b3\u221a(1/27) = (1/27)^(1/3) = 1^(1/3)/27^(1/3) = 1/3.\n3. Outermost: \u221a(1/3) = (1/3)^(1/2) = 1^(1/2)/3^(1/2) = 1/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3.\n\nYep, same result. So regardless of the method, the answer is \u221a3 divided by 3. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. Let me check if there's any alternative representation or if I made a mistake in assuming 729 is 3^6. Let's verify 3^6:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729. Yes, that's correct. So 3^6 is indeed 729. Therefore, 1/729 is 3^(-6), so exponentiating that to 1/12 gives 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3. All steps check out.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The expression is a bunch of roots applied successively. Sometimes, when dealing with multiple roots, it's helpful to combine them into a single exponent. Since the nth root of something is the same as raising that something to the power of 1/n. So, the square root is exponent 1/2, cube root is exponent 1/3, etc. So starting from the inside:\n\nFirst operation: square root, exponent 1/2.\n\nThen, cube root, exponent 1/3.\n\nThen, square root, exponent 1/2.\n\nSo the total exponent is 1/2 * 1/3 * 1/2. Let me compute that:\n\n1/2 * 1/3 = 1/6, then 1/6 * 1/2 = 1/12. So the total exponent is 1/12. Therefore, the entire expression is (1/729)^(1/12). As established earlier, that's 3^(-1/2) which is 1/\u221a3, rationalized to \u221a3/3.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach\u2014breaking it down step by step or using exponents\u2014the result is the same. So I feel confident that the simplified form with a rational denominator is \u221a3 over 3.\n\nJust to make sure there isn't a simpler form or if perhaps 729 can be expressed as another base. For example, 729 is also 9^3, since 9*9=81, 81*9=729. So 9^3 is 729. Then, 1/729 is 9^(-3). Then, (9^(-3))^(1/12) = 9^(-3/12) = 9^(-1/4) = (3^2)^(-1/4) = 3^(-2/4) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/\u221a3 = \u221a3/3. Same result. So even if we express 729 as 9^3, we still end up with the same answer. Therefore, no matter how we break it down, the answer remains consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think I've thoroughly checked and confirmed that the simplified expression with a rational denominator is \u221a3/3. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and all alternative methods lead to the same conclusion. So I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}"
