        "question": "Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest negative number in the set B, which is defined as all the sums m + n where (m, n) are integer solutions to the equation 7m + 12n = 22. Hmm, let me start by recalling how to solve linear Diophantine equations. \n\nFirst, the equation is 7m + 12n = 22. Since 7 and 12 are coefficients, I should check if 22 is a multiple of their greatest common divisor (gcd). The gcd of 7 and 12 is 1 because 7 is prime and doesn't divide 12. Since 1 divides 22, there are integer solutions. \n\nNow, to find all solutions, I need one particular solution and then describe the general solution. Let me try to find particular solutions by trial or using the extended Euclidean algorithm. Let me try the extended Euclidean algorithm first.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm for 12 and 7:\n\n12 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 5. So, 12 = 1*7 + 5.\n\n7 divided by 5 is 1 with a remainder of 2. So, 7 = 1*5 + 2.\n\n5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So, 5 = 2*2 + 1.\n\n2 divided by 1 is 2 with a remainder of 0. So, gcd is 1.\n\nNow, working backwards for the extended part:\n\n1 = 5 - 2*2\n\nBut 2 = 7 - 1*5 from the second equation.\n\nSo substitute: 1 = 5 - 2*(7 - 1*5) = 5 - 2*7 + 2*5 = 3*5 - 2*7\n\nBut 5 = 12 - 1*7 from the first equation.\n\nSubstitute again: 1 = 3*(12 - 1*7) - 2*7 = 3*12 - 3*7 - 2*7 = 3*12 -5*7\n\nTherefore, 1 = 3*12 -5*7. Multiply both sides by 22 to get 22 = (3*22)*12 + (-5*22)*7. Wait, that would give 22 = 66*12 - 110*7. Hmm, so a particular solution is m = -110, n = 66. But that seems like a big number. Maybe there's a smaller particular solution?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a particular solution by trial. Let me see.\n\nWe need 7m +12n =22. Let me try to find integers m and n.\n\nLet me solve for m in terms of n: 7m =22 -12n => m=(22 -12n)/7. So, to have m integer, 22 -12n must be divisible by 7. Let me see for which n this is true.\n\n22 mod7 is 1, since 3*7=21, so 22-21=1. So 22 -12n \u22611 - (12n mod7). 12 mod7 is 5, so 12n mod7 is 5n mod7. Therefore, 1 -5n \u22610 mod7. So 5n \u22611 mod7. Let me solve 5n \u22611 mod7. Multiplying both sides by the inverse of 5 mod7. The inverse of 5 mod7 is 3 because 5*3=15\u22611 mod7. So n\u22613*1=3 mod7. Therefore, n=7k +3 for some integer k. \n\nTherefore, the solutions for n are n=7k +3. Then plugging back into m=(22 -12n)/7:\n\nm=(22 -12*(7k +3))/7 = (22 -84k -36)/7 = (-14 -84k)/7 = -2 -12k.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is m= -2 -12k and n=3 +7k for integer k. \n\nSo all solutions are given by (m,n)= (-2 -12k, 3 +7k). \n\nTherefore, the set A is all pairs of integers of that form. Now, set B is the set of m + n for each such pair. Let me compute m + n:\n\nm + n = (-2 -12k) + (3 +7k) = ( -2 +3 ) + (-12k +7k ) = 1 -5k.\n\nTherefore, B is the set {1 -5k | k \u2208 \u2124}. \n\nWe need the greatest negative number in B. That is, the maximum k such that 1 -5k <0. Let me solve 1 -5k <0 => -5k < -1 => 5k >1 => k>1/5. Since k must be an integer, k\u22651. \n\nTherefore, the elements of B that are negative correspond to k\u22651, and we need the maximum among them. Since k can be 1,2,3,..., the \"greatest\" (i.e., closest to zero) negative number would be when k is as small as possible, which is k=1. Wait, but hold on. Wait, if k=1, then 1 -5(1)= -4. If k=2, it's 1 -10= -9, which is more negative. Wait, so actually the \"greatest\" negative number is the one closest to zero, so the least negative, which would be when k is the smallest integer making 1 -5k negative. Since k must be at least 1, then k=1 gives -4, which is the largest (i.e., the least negative) among them. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. The question says \"the greatest negative number\", so the maximum value in B that is still negative. Since B is 1 -5k, so when is 1 -5k negative? When k \u22651. The maximum value among those is when k is as small as possible, so k=1 gives -4, which is the largest (closest to zero) negative number. \n\nBut hold on, let me check if there are any solutions with k=0. If k=0, then m +n =1 -0=1, which is positive, so not negative. So the first negative is at k=1, which is -4, then k=2 gives -9, etc. So the answer should be -4? But let me check with actual m and n values. \n\nLet me compute for k=1: m = -2 -12(1)= -14, n=3 +7(1)=10. Then m +n = -14 +10= -4. \n\nFor k=0: m=-2, n=3, so m +n=1. \n\nk=2: m= -2 -24= -26, n=3 +14=17, so m +n= -26 +17= -9. \n\nk=-1: m= -2 +12=10, n=3 -7= -4, so m +n=10 + (-4)=6. \n\nSo indeed, when k=1, we get -4, which is the first negative. So the greatest negative number is -4. \n\nWait, but hold on, is there a solution with a higher k that gives a less negative number? Wait, no. Because as k increases beyond 1, the value becomes more negative. If k decreases below 1, like k=0 gives positive. So the maximum negative is indeed -4. \n\nBut let me check if there are other solutions outside of the general solution? Wait, the general solution should cover all solutions. Since the coefficients are 7 and 12, the steps are 12 and 7 in the coefficients, so the general solution is correctly given by varying k over all integers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of k? Let me see. Suppose I take k=1, gives m=-14, n=10. Let me check 7*(-14) +12*10 = -98 +120=22. Correct. \n\nSimilarly, k=2: 7*(-26) +12*17= -182 +204=22. Correct. \n\nk=-1: 7*(10) +12*(-4)=70 -48=22. Correct. \n\nSo all those are valid. \n\nTherefore, the set B is indeed all numbers of the form 1 -5k. So to find the greatest negative number in B, which is the maximum of all elements in B less than zero. Since B is an arithmetic sequence with difference -5, starting at k=0: 1, -4, -9, -14,... and for k negative: when k=-1, it's 1 -5*(-1)=6; k=-2, 1+10=11, etc. So the negative elements are when k\u22651, and the first term is -4, then each next term is 5 less. So the maximum among them is -4. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be -4. Wait, but the question says \"the greatest negative number\". So that's the maximum of the negatives, which is -4. \n\nBut let me just confirm once again. Suppose someone might think of another solution where m +n is between -4 and 0, like -3, -2, etc. But according to the general solution, B only contains numbers of the form 1 -5k. So 1 -5k must be negative, so 1 -5k <0 => k>1/5. Since k must be integer, k\u22651. Then 1 -5k can be -4, -9, -14,... So there are no elements of B between -4 and 0. Hence, -4 is indeed the greatest negative number in B. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is \\boxed{-4}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-4}\n</think>\n\nTo find the greatest negative number in the set \\( B = \\{m + n : (m, n) \\in A\\} \\) where \\( A \\) is the set of all ordered pairs of integers \\((m, n)\\) such that \\( 7m + 12n = 22 \\), we start by solving the linear Diophantine equation.\n\nFirst, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find a particular solution. We find that:\n\n\\[\n1 = 3 \\cdot 12 - 5 \\cdot 7\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 22, we get:\n\n\\[\n22 = 66 \\cdot 12 - 110 \\cdot 7\n\\]\n\nThus, a particular solution is \\( m = -110 \\) and \\( n = 66 \\). However, we can find a more general solution by noting that the homogeneous solutions are given by:\n\n\\[\nm = -2 - 12k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = 3 + 7k \\quad \\text{for some integer } k\n\\]\n\nWe then compute \\( m + n \\) for these solutions:\n\n\\[\nm + n = (-2 - 12k) + (3 + 7k) = 1 - 5k\n\\]\n\nWe need the greatest negative number in the set \\( B \\), which corresponds to the maximum value of \\( 1 - 5k \\) that is negative. Solving \\( 1 - 5k < 0 \\) gives \\( k \\geq 1 \\). The smallest integer \\( k \\) is 1, leading to:\n\n\\[\n1 - 5 \\cdot 1 = -4\n\\]\n\nChecking other values of \\( k \\) confirms that larger \\( k \\) values result in more negative numbers. Therefore, the greatest negative number in \\( B \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-4}\n\\]"
