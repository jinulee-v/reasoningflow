        "question": "_______ is the direct attempt to formally or informally manage ethical issues or problems, through specific policies, practices and programmes.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question: \"_______ is the direct attempt to formally or informally manage ethical issues or problems, through specific policies, practices and programmes.\" Hmm, let's start by breaking down the question. The blank is asking for a term that refers to managing ethical issues through policies, practices, and programs, either formally or informally. \n\nFirst, I should think about different areas related to ethics in organizations or society. The key words here are \"manage ethical issues,\" \"formally or informally,\" and \"specific policies, practices, and programs.\" So it's about structured approaches to handle ethics.\n\nMaybe it's something like \"ethics management\"? But I'm not sure if that's a standard term. Let me think of related concepts. There's \"corporate social responsibility\" (CSR), but that's broader, encompassing social and environmental responsibilities too. \"Ethics programs\" is another possibility. Organizations often have ethics programs that include policies and training. \n\nWait, the question mentions \"direct attempt,\" so it's more about the process or the system put in place. Another term could be \"compliance programs,\" but compliance is more about following laws and regulations, which is part of ethics but maybe not the whole picture. \n\nThere's also \"business ethics management\" or \"organizational ethics management.\" Alternatively, \"ethical governance\" might be a term, but governance is more about the structure and decision-making. \n\nI think \"ethics management\" is a possible answer, but maybe the more precise term is \"corporate ethics program\" or \"organizational ethics program.\" However, the question uses the phrase \"direct attempt to manage ethical issues,\" so perhaps the term is more general. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethics management systems\" could be another term. Let me check if there's a standard term used in business ethics literature. \n\nWait, another angle: the question says \"formally or informally.\" So it's not just formal systems. Maybe \"ethics management\" can be both formal and informal. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethics initiatives\" might be too vague. \n\nWait, the term \"ethics management\" is used in some contexts. Let me think of the components: policies, practices, programs. That sounds like an ethics management system. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is a term I've heard before. But maybe the answer is simpler. Let me think of the term \"ethics management\" itself. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate social responsibility\" includes ethics, but again, it's broader. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"the direct attempt to manage ethical issues,\" so maybe the answer is \"ethics management\" or \"ethical management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"business ethics management\" is a term used in some textbooks. \n\nAlternatively, \"organizational ethics management\" could be the term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"ethics programs\" is the answer. The question mentions \"specific policies, practices and programmes,\" so \"ethics programs\" might be the direct answer. \n\nWait, but the blank is a single term. Let me see. The question is asking for the term that refers to the process of managing ethical issues through those means. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is a possible answer, but perhaps the more standard term is \"ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"compliance and ethics programs\" (CEPs) is a term used in organizations, but that's more specific. \n\nHmm. Let me think of the components again. The question says \"direct attempt to manage ethical issues through specific policies, practices and programmes.\" So the answer is likely \"ethics management\" or \"corporate ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"corporate governance\" but that's broader. \n\nWait, another thought: \"Ethics management\" is the process of managing ethics within an organization, which includes policies, training, codes of conduct, etc. That seems to fit. \n\nAlternatively, \"organizational ethics management\" is a term used in some academic contexts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"ethics management systems.\" \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term is \"corporate social responsibility,\" but that's more about social and environmental responsibility. \n\nAlternatively, \"business ethics management\" is a term used in some business ethics courses. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"ethics programs.\" The question mentions \"programmes\" so maybe \"ethics programs\" is the answer. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the term that is the direct attempt, so maybe the answer is \"ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics program\" is a specific term. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"corporate ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the term is \"corporate governance,\" but that's more about the structure and accountability. \n\nAlternatively, \"compliance programs\" focus on legal compliance, but the question is about ethics. \n\nHmm. Let me think of the definition again. The key is managing ethical issues through policies, practices, and programs, both formal and informal. \n\nAnother angle: In business ethics, organizations often have an \"ethics and compliance program\" which includes policies, training, reporting mechanisms, etc. But the question mentions \"ethical issues or problems,\" so maybe \"ethics management\" is the broader term. \n\nAlternatively, the term might be \"corporate ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"corporate social responsibility,\" but that's broader. \n\nWait, maybe the answer is \"corporate ethics management\" or \"organizational ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, the term \"ethics management\" is the direct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"business ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term is \"corporate governance,\" but that's more about the structure. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics program\" is a possible answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"ethics management systems.\" \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"corporate ethics initiatives.\" \n\nHmm. Let me check some sources. \n\nWait, in some definitions, \"ethics management\" is defined as the process of managing ethics within an organization through policies, training, etc. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is a term used in some contexts. \n\nAlternatively, the term \"ethics management\" is the most straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"corporate social responsibility,\" but that's broader. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics program\" is a specific term. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"corporate ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"corporate governance,\" but that's more about the structure. \n\nAlternatively, \"compliance and ethics programs\" (CEPs) is a term used in organizations. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethics programs\" is the answer. \n\nWait, the question says \"specific policies, practices and programmes,\" so \"ethics programs\" would be part of that. But the blank is the term for the entire process. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is \"ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is more precise. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"corporate social responsibility,\" but that's broader. \n\nAlternatively, \"business ethics management\" is a term used in some textbooks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"corporate ethics initiatives.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is the term. \n\nAlternatively, \"organizational ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"ethics management systems.\" \n\nHmm. Since I can't look it up, I have to go with my best guess. The question is from a business ethics context. The term that refers to managing ethical issues through policies, practices, and programs is often called an \"ethics program\" or \"corporate ethics program.\" However, the question uses the phrase \"direct attempt to manage,\" which might be referring to the broader concept of ethics management. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethics management\" is the process, while \"ethics program\" is the specific implementation. Since the question mentions \"specific policies, practices and programmes,\" maybe the answer is \"ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is more precise. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \"corporate governance,\" but that's not exactly it. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate social responsibility\" includes ethics but also other aspects. \n\nHmm. Another thought: The term \"ethics management\" is used in the field. For example, in the book \"Ethics Management in the 21st Century\" by Norman E. Bowie, so that's a possible term. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is a term used in some academic papers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"corporate ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"business ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"organizational ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"ethics management systems.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics initiatives.\" \n\nHmm. Since the question is asking for the term that is the direct attempt to manage ethical issues through policies, practices, and programs, I think the most likely answer is \"ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is more specific. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics program\" is a possible answer. \n\nWait, the question says \"direct attempt to formally or informally manage ethical issues or problems, through specific policies, practices and programmes.\" The key here is that it's the management of ethics through these means. \n\nAnother angle: The term \"ethics management\" is the process, while \"ethics programs\" are the specific implementations. Since the question mentions \"specific policies, practices and programmes,\" perhaps the answer is \"ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is the term. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"corporate social responsibility,\" but that's broader. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate governance\" is more about the structure. \n\nHmm. I think I'll go with \"ethics management\" as the answer. Alternatively, \"corporate ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"corporate ethics program.\" \n\nWait, the question uses the word \"manage,\" so \"management\" is part of the term. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management\" is the term. \n\nAlternatively, \"business ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"organizational ethics management.\" \n\nHmm. Since I can't be 100% sure, but given the options, I think \"ethics management\" is the most straightforward answer. Alternatively, \"corporate ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \"corporate social responsibility,\" but that's broader. \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate governance,\" but that's not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, \"compliance and ethics programs\" (CEPs) is a term used in organizations. \n\nAlternatively, \"ethics programs\" is the answer. \n\nWait, the question says \"direct attempt to manage ethical issues through specific policies, practices and programmes.\" So the answer is the term for the process, which is \"ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"corporate ethics management.\" \n\nAlternatively, \"business ethics management.\" \n\nHmm. I think I'll settle on \"ethics management\" as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe term that fits the blank is **\"Ethics Management\"**. \n\n**Explanation:**  \nEthics Management refers to the systematic approach, both formal and informal, through which organizations address ethical issues and challenges. It involves implementing specific policies, practices, and programs to foster ethical behavior, ensure compliance with standards, and resolve moral dilemmas. This concept encompasses strategies like codes of conduct, training initiatives, whistleblower systems, and accountability mechanisms, all aimed at promoting integrity and responsible decision-making. While terms like \"corporate ethics programs\" or \"compliance and ethics programs\" are more specific, \"Ethics Management\" broadly captures the intentional effort to manage ethical concerns through structured interventions."
