        "question": "An auditor traces the serial numbers on equipment to a nonissuer\u2019s subledger. Which of the following management assertions is supported by this test?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which management assertion is supported by an auditor tracing serial numbers on equipment to a nonissuer\u2019s subledger. Hmm, let me start by recalling what management assertions are. From what I remember, there are four main assertions in auditing: existence, rights and obligations, completeness, and valuation. Maybe there's also something about presentation and disclosure, but I think the main ones here are the first four.\n\nThe question is about tracing serial numbers to a subledger that's not the issuer's. Wait, a subledger is part of the accounting system that holds detailed transactions, and the general ledger is a summary. So if the auditor is checking the serial numbers on equipment against a subledger, they're probably verifying that the equipment actually exists and is recorded properly.\n\nLet me think. The existence assertion is about whether the assets actually exist. So if the auditor can trace the physical serial numbers to the subledger, that would support that the equipment exists because they can match the physical item to the records. But then there's also the rights and obligations assertion, which is about whether the company actually owns the asset. If the subledger is from a nonissuer, maybe that's a third party? Wait, maybe the nonissuer here refers to a subsidiary or another entity? Or perhaps it's a subledger that's not maintained by the company itself?\n\nWait, the term \"nonissuer\u2019s subledger\" might mean that the subledger belongs to a party that is not the issuer of the equipment. So maybe the company doesn't own the equipment, but it's leased or financed through another party. In that case, tracing the serial numbers to another entity's subledger might relate to rights and obligations. Because if the equipment is financed by another party, the company might not have the rights to it yet. So by tracing to the nonissuer's subledger, the auditor is checking if the company actually has the right to the equipment or if it's someone else's asset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the existence is still the key here. If the serial numbers are recorded in their own subledger, that would support existence. But the question says tracing to a nonissuer\u2019s subledger. So perhaps the company is supposed to have the equipment, but the serial numbers are recorded in another entity's subledger, which might indicate that the company doesn't actually own it. Therefore, the auditor is checking the rights and obligations assertion to ensure that the company has the right to the equipment they're recording.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall the definitions again. \n\nExistence: The asset, liability, or equity claim exists. So if the auditor can confirm that the physical asset (equipment with serial numbers) is recorded in the company's books, that supports existence. But here, they are tracing to a nonissuer's subledger. Maybe the nonissuer is the lessor, so the subledger there would show that the equipment is leased, so the company doesn't own it. Therefore, if the company's records show the equipment as owned, but the serial numbers are in the lessor's subledger, that would indicate a problem with rights and obligations. So the test is supporting that the company has the right to the equipment, so if they can trace it to the nonissuer's subledger, maybe that's showing that they don't have the right, so the auditor is testing the rights and obligations assertion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test is to ensure that all equipment is recorded in the subledger. Wait, but the question is about which assertion is supported by the test. The options probably include existence, rights and obligations, completeness, valuation, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the auditor is verifying that the equipment listed in the subledger actually exists by checking the serial numbers. So tracing from the physical asset to the subledger would support existence. But the question says tracing the serial numbers to the nonissuer's subledger. Wait, perhaps the auditor is going the other way: starting from the subledger and checking the physical assets? Or starting from the physical assets and checking the subledger?\n\nThe wording says \"traces the serial numbers on equipment to a nonissuer\u2019s subledger.\" So starting with the equipment's serial numbers and seeing if they are recorded in the nonissuer's subledger. That would mean that the equipment's serial numbers are present in another entity's records, which might indicate that the equipment belongs to that entity, not the company. Therefore, the company might be incorrectly recording the equipment as their own when it's actually owned by the nonissuer. So this test would support the rights and obligations assertion because it's checking whether the company has the right to the equipment (i.e., ownership). If the serial numbers are in another entity's subledger, that suggests the company doesn't have the rights, so the auditor is testing that assertion.\n\nAlternatively, if the auditor is confirming that the equipment exists by matching the serial numbers to the subledger, that's existence. But since it's a nonissuer's subledger, maybe the company's own subledger isn't being checked. Wait, perhaps the company's subledger is supposed to have the serial numbers, but the auditor is cross-referencing with another subledger to ensure accuracy. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose a company leases equipment from another company (the nonissuer). The lessor (nonissuer) would have a subledger entry for that equipment. If the auditor traces the serial numbers of the equipment the company is using to the lessor's subledger, that would confirm that the equipment is indeed leased, so the company doesn't own it. Therefore, the company's assertion that they own the equipment (rights and obligations) is incorrect. So the test is supporting the rights and obligations assertion by ensuring that the company has the rights to the equipment. If the serial numbers are in the lessor's subledger, that would indicate a problem with the rights assertion.\n\nAlternatively, if the company's subledger is supposed to list all their equipment, and the auditor is checking that each piece of equipment's serial number is in their own subledger, that would be existence. But the question specifies a nonissuer's subledger, so it's another entity's. Therefore, the key point is about ownership, so rights and obligations.\n\nAnother angle: The management assertions include existence (the asset is there), rights (they own it), completeness (all assets are recorded), valuation (correctly valued). Tracing to a nonissuer's subledger would relate to whether the company actually has the right to the asset. If the asset is recorded in another entity's subledger, that suggests the company doesn't have the rights, so the test is supporting the rights and obligations assertion. Therefore, the correct answer is rights and obligations.\n</think>\n\nThe auditor tracing serial numbers on equipment to a **nonissuer\u2019s subledger** primarily supports the **rights and obligations** management assertion. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Analysis:\n1. **Rights and Obligations Assertion**:  \n   This assertion confirms that the entity has the legal rights to the assets (or obligations for liabilities) it records.  \n   - If the serial numbers of equipment are traced to a **nonissuer\u2019s subledger** (e.g., a lessor or financing entity), it indicates that the equipment may belong to another party.  \n   - This test verifies whether the company has the **right to the equipment** (e.g., ownership or valid lease terms). If the serial numbers appear in another entity\u2019s records, it could signal a misstatement in the company\u2019s assertion of rights over the asset.\n\n2. **Why Not Other Assertions?**  \n   - **Existence**: While tracing physical assets to records supports existence, the reference to a **nonissuer\u2019s subledger** shifts focus to ownership rather than mere existence.  \n   - **Completeness/Valuation**: These relate to whether all assets are recorded or properly valued, which are less directly tied to cross-referencing with a third party\u2019s records.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe test ensures the company\u2019s assertion about **ownership or control** of the equipment is valid. If the serial numbers are recorded in another entity\u2019s subledger, it raises questions about the company\u2019s rights, making **rights and obligations** the supported assertion.\n\n**Answer:** **Rights and obligations**."

If the serial numbers appear in another entity\u2019s records, it could signal a misstatement in the company\u2019s assertion of rights over the asset.\n\n2. **Why Not Other Assertions?**  \n   - **Existence**: While tracing physical assets to records supports existence, the reference to a **nonissuer\u2019s subledger** shifts focus to ownership rather than mere existence.  \n   - **Completeness/Valuation**: These relate to whether all assets are recorded or properly valued, which are less directly tied to cross-referencing with a third party\u2019s records.\n\n",
