        "response": "Metz argues that consequentialist arguments against capital punishment based on African values are flawed because they rely on the assumption that capital punishment is always wrong, regardless of the circumstances. He argues that this assumption is not supported by African values, which emphasize the importance of justice and retribution. Instead, he suggests that consequentialist arguments against capital punishment should focus on the potential negative consequences of the practice, such as the risk of wrongful execution and the potential for capital punishment to be used as a tool of political repression."
