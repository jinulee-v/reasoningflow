        "response": "Mars is red because its surface is covered in iron oxide, also known as rust. The iron in the Martian soil is exposed to the oxygen in the atmosphere, which oxidizes the iron and gives the planet its reddish appearance. Additionally, the dust storms on Mars can spread the red dust across the planet, making it appear even redder from a distance."
