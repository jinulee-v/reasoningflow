    },
    "raw_text": {
        "question": "What types of force does Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibit?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what types of force Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits. Let me start by recalling what I know about the UN Charter. I remember that the UN was established after World War II to prevent future conflicts, so the Charter probably has provisions about the use of force between states. \n\nArticle 2 is one of the key articles, right? I think Article 2(4) specifically deals with the use of force. From what I've heard before, it says something like states can't use force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. But I need to be precise here.\n\nWait, the exact wording might be important. Let me try to remember or reconstruct it. The article probably prohibits member states from using force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence of any state. So, the types of force prohibited would be those that violate these three aspects. \n\nBut what counts as \"force\" here? Does it include military actions, economic sanctions, cyber attacks? Hmm, I think the traditional understanding is that it refers to armed force. Economic sanctions might be covered under other parts of the Charter, like Article 41, which allows for non-military measures. But I'm not sure if economic coercion is considered \"force\" under Article 2(4). Maybe not, since sanctions are allowed under certain conditions.\n\nThen there's the question of self-defense. Article 51 allows for self-defense, so that's an exception. So the prohibited force is the one not in self-defense. Also, collective security actions authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII would be exceptions too. So the prohibited force is unauthorized uses of military force against another state's sovereignty, territory, or political independence.\n\nWait, but what about non-military coercion? Like blockades or cyber attacks? I think there's some debate here. The original intent was to prevent wars, so maybe it's mainly about armed attacks. But cyber attacks that are equivalent to armed attacks might be covered. Also, interventions that undermine a government's political independence, like supporting coups or destabilizing actions, could be considered prohibited.\n\nAnother point: territorial integrity. So any use of force that invades or occupies another country's territory is prohibited. Political independence would mean actions that overthrow a government or control another state's policies against its will. \n\nSo putting this all together, Article 2(4) prohibits the use of armed force by a state against another state's sovereignty, territory, or political independence, except in cases of self-defense or Security Council authorization. The types of force include military invasions, bombings, blockades (if they're considered acts of war), covert operations that destabilize a government, etc. But economic sanctions alone might not be considered \"force\" unless they're part of a broader coercive military action.\n\nI should also check if there are any other exceptions or nuances. For example, humanitarian interventions without Security Council approval might be considered a violation, even if intended to stop atrocities. The principle of non-intervention is related here. Also, the use of force in civil wars? If a state supports rebels in another country, that might be considered intervention in their internal affairs, hence prohibited.\n\nWait, but the wording is \"any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\" So even threats are prohibited. So military threats, like amassing troops at a border, could be a violation if they're against another state's sovereignty.\n\nI think that's the main idea. To summarize, the prohibited forces are any armed threats or uses of force that target another state's sovereignty, territory, or political independence, except when authorized by the Security Council or in self-defense. The exact scope might have some gray areas, like cyber attacks or economic measures, but traditionally it's about military force.\n</think>\n\nArticle 2(4) of the United Nations Charter states:  \n**\"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.\"**  \n\n### Types of Force Prohibited:\n1. **Military Force**:  \n   - **Armed Attacks**: Direct military invasions, bombings, blockades, or occupations that violate another state's sovereignty, territory, or political independence.  \n   - **Covert Military Actions**: Activities such as supporting coups, paramilitary groups, or destabilizing operations aimed at overthrowing a government or undermining its authority.  \n\n2. **Threats of Force**:  \n   - Military posturing (e.g., amassing troops at a border) or explicit threats intended to coerce a state into changing its policies or actions.  \n\n3. **Intervention in Internal Affairs**:  \n   - Actions that interfere with a state's political independence, such as imposing a regime change, manipulating elections, or undermining governance structures.  \n\n4. **Cyber Attacks**:  \n   - While debated, cyber operations equivalent to armed attacks (e.g., disrupting critical infrastructure, causing physical damage) may fall under this prohibition.  \n\n### Key Exceptions:\n- **Self-Defense (Article 51)**: A state may use force in self-defense if subjected to an armed attack, provided it promptly reports to the Security Council.  \n- **Security Council Authorization (Chapter VII)**: Force may be used with UNSC approval to maintain or restore international peace and security.  \n\n### Clarifications:\n- **Economic Measures**: Sanctions or embargoes alone are generally not considered \"force\" under Article 2(4), as they fall under Chapter VI (non-military measures) or Chapter VII if authorized.  \n- **Humanitarian Interventions**: Without UNSC approval, unilateral military interventions for humanitarian purposes (e.g., stopping genocide) are prohibited under Article 2(4), though they may be controversially justified under the \"Responsibility to Protect\" (R2P) doctrine.  \n\n### Scope and Intent:\n- The provision aims to prevent aggression and maintain international peace by restricting the use of force to exceptional circumstances. It reflects the post-WWII consensus against war as an instrument of policy.  \n\nIn summary, Article 2(4) prohibits **any unauthorized use or threat of armed force** that undermines another state's sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence, except in cases of self-defense or UNSC-authorized actions."
