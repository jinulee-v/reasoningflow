        "question": "The coil of a moving coil meter has 100 turns, is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide. The control torque is 240*10-6 N-m on full scale. If magnetic flux density is 1Wb/m2 range of meter is",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the range of this moving coil meter. Let me see, the problem gives me the number of turns, the dimensions of the coil, the control torque at full scale, and the magnetic flux density. Hmm, I remember that moving coil meters work based on the torque produced by the current in the magnetic field. The torque should be balanced by the control torque when it's at full scale. \n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the torque on a coil in a magnetic field. The torque (\u03c4) is given by the number of turns (N) multiplied by the current (I) multiplied by the magnetic flux density (B) multiplied by the area (A) of the coil, and then multiplied by the sine of the angle between the plane of the coil and the magnetic field. But since it's a moving coil meter, I think the coil is arranged such that the plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field when it's at rest, so the angle is 90 degrees, and sine of 90 is 1. So the formula simplifies to \u03c4 = N * I * B * A.\n\nThe control torque is given as 240*10^-6 N-m at full scale. That should be equal to the torque produced by the current when the meter is at full scale. So setting them equal: N * I * B * A = control torque. Then I can solve for I, which would be the full scale current, and that would give me the range of the meter.\n\nLet me note down the given values:\n\nNumber of turns, N = 100\n\nLength of the coil, L = 40 mm = 0.04 m\n\nWidth of the coil, W = 30 mm = 0.03 m\n\nSo the area A of the coil would be length multiplied by width, right? So A = L * W = 0.04 m * 0.03 m = 0.0012 m\u00b2.\n\nMagnetic flux density, B = 1 Wb/m\u00b2\n\nControl torque, \u03c4 = 240*10^-6 N-m\n\nSo plugging into the torque equation:\n\nN * I * B * A = \u03c4\n\nSo solving for I:\n\nI = \u03c4 / (N * B * A)\n\nLet me compute the denominator first: N * B * A = 100 * 1 * 0.0012 = 100 * 0.0012 = 0.12\n\nThen \u03c4 is 240e-6 N-m, so I = 240e-6 / 0.12\n\nCalculating that: 240 divided by 0.12 is 2000, so 240e-6 / 0.12 = 2000e-6 = 2e-3 A, which is 2 milliamperes.\n\nWait, so the full scale current is 2 mA? That would mean the range of the meter is 2 mA? Hmm, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, converting mm to meters: 40 mm is 0.04 m, 30 mm is 0.03 m. Multiplying those gives 0.0012 m\u00b2, that's correct.\n\nThen N is 100, B is 1, so 100 * 1 * 0.0012 is indeed 0.12.\n\nThen 240e-6 divided by 0.12: 240 divided by 120 is 2, so 240 divided by 120 is 2, but since it's 240 divided by 120 (since 0.12 is 120e-3), so 240e-6 divided by 0.12 is (240 / 120) * (1e-6 / 1e-3) )? Wait, maybe better to do straight division:\n\n240e-6 / 0.12 = (240 / 0.12) * 1e-6 = 2000 * 1e-6 = 2e-3 A. Yeah, that's 2 milliamps. So the range is 2 mA. \n\nHmm, but let me think again if I used the right formula. The torque equation for a moving coil meter is indeed \u03c4 = N * B * l * w * I, where l and w are the length and width? Wait, actually, the area A is l * w, so that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as \u03c4 = N * B * I * A, so that's the same thing. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the formula might have a different arrangement, but I think that's right. Let me confirm with another approach. Suppose the coil has N turns, each turn has a length L and width W, so the area per turn is L*W. The torque per turn would be B * I * L * W, so total torque is N * B * I * L * W. So yes, that's the same as N * B * I * A. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems right. The full scale current is 2 mA, so the range of the meter is 2 mA. Therefore, the answer should be 2 mA. Wait, but the problem says \"range of meter is...\", so maybe they want it in Amperes? 0.002 A? But usually, the range is expressed in the unit that's appropriate, so 2 mA is probably acceptable. Let me check if I made any unit conversion errors.\n\nWait, 40 mm is 0.04 meters, 30 mm is 0.03 meters. Multiplying gives 0.0012 m\u00b2. Correct. B is 1 Wb/m\u00b2. So all units are in SI units. The torque is given in N-m, which is also SI. So the current comes out in Amperes. 2e-3 A is 2 mA. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, seems straightforward. Maybe I overcomplicating, but I think that's the right answer. Let me see if there's another way someone might approach it and get a different answer. For instance, if they thought the length and width were the dimensions of the coil's loop in a different way, but no, the coil is 40 mm long and 30 mm wide, so the area is length times width. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula uses the average length or something else? Hmm, no, the formula is straightforward. The torque is proportional to the area. So I think my answer is correct. The range is 2 mA. \n\nWait, but let me check once more the numbers:\n\n240e-6 divided by (100 * 1 * 0.0012). Let me compute denominator first: 100 * 1 is 100, times 0.0012 is 0.12. So 240e-6 divided by 0.12. 240 divided by 120 is 2, so 240 divided by 12 is 20, but 0.12 is 12/100. Wait, perhaps better to write 240e-6 / 0.12 = (240 / 0.12) * 1e-6. 240 divided by 0.12 is 2000, so 2000e-6 is 0.002 A. Yep, that's 2 mA. \n\nAlright, I think that's solid. So the range is 2 milliamperes.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe range of the meter is \\boxed{2 \\text{ mA}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the range of the moving coil meter, we use the torque equation for a moving coil meter, which states that the torque produced by the current must equal the control torque at full scale. The formula for torque is:\n\n\\[\n\\tau = N \\cdot I \\cdot B \\cdot A\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( N \\) is the number of turns (100),\n- \\( I \\) is the current (to be found),\n- \\( B \\) is the magnetic flux density (1 Wb/m\u00b2),\n- \\( A \\) is the area of the coil.\n\nFirst, calculate the area \\( A \\) of the coil:\n\\[\nA = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} = 0.04 \\, \\text{m} \\times 0.03 \\, \\text{m} = 0.0012 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nNext, set the torque produced by the current equal to the control torque:\n\\[\nN \\cdot I \\cdot B \\cdot A = \\text{control torque}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n\\[\n100 \\cdot I \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0.0012 = 240 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{N-m}\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( I \\):\n\\[\nI = \\frac{240 \\times 10^{-6}}{100 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0.0012}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the denominator:\n\\[\n100 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0.0012 = 0.12\n\\]\n\nThen compute \\( I \\):\n\\[\nI = \\frac{240 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.12} = \\frac{240}{0.12} \\times 10^{-6} = 2000 \\times 10^{-6} = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{A} = 2 \\, \\text{mA}\n\\]\n\nThus, the range of the meter is \\boxed{2 \\text{ mA}}."
