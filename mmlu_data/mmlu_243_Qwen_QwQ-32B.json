        "question": "On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely",
        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about whether a teacher can get a mandatory injunction to remove a fence built by a librarian on a lot that's subject to certain restrictions in a recorded development plan. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the facts. The development plan was recorded in 1980 by the original developer. The plan has two relevant restrictions: (22) a 10-foot strip along the rear of each lot is a franchise right for public utilities, and (23) no structures can be built on that strip. \n\nThe retiree bought a lot in 2000, built a house, and put up a fence in the restricted area. Then the teacher bought an adjacent lot in 2004 and built a house. The librarian bought the next lot in 2006, and in 2008, the librarian built a fence along the line between his lot and the teacher's, right in the middle of the 10-foot strip. The teacher is objecting and wants the fence removed via injunction.\n\nSo, the key points here are the recorded restrictions and whether the fence violates them. The question is whether the court will grant the injunction. \n\nFirst, the development plan was recorded, so subsequent purchasers are on notice. The librarian's deed referenced the plan, so he should have known about the restrictions. The fence is built on the 10-foot strip, which is supposed to be for public utilities and no structures. The retiree already built a fence there, but maybe that's a problem too? But the teacher is suing the librarian, not the retiree.\n\nWait, the retiree built the fence in the restricted area in 2000. The teacher bought in 2004. So when the teacher bought, the fence was already there. But the development plan was recorded before the teacher bought, so the teacher is bound by it. But the retiree's fence might be a prior violation. However, the teacher is now suing the librarian for building a fence in the same area. \n\nThe librarian's fence is along the line between his lot and the teacher's, so that's part of the 10-foot strip. The restriction says no structures can be built on that strip. The fence is a structure, so that's a violation. But maybe the retiree's fence is also a violation, but the teacher is only suing the librarian. \n\nBut the question is about the court's likely decision. Since the development plan is recorded and the librarian had notice, the court would probably enforce the restrictions. The fence is a structure on the restricted area, so it's prohibited. Therefore, the injunction should be granted. \n\nWait, but maybe there's an issue with the retiree's prior fence? If the retiree already built a fence there, does that mean the restriction was waived or that the librarian can do the same? But the restrictions are part of the recorded plan, so prior violations don't necessarily negate the restrictions. Each subsequent owner is still bound by the original covenants. So even if the retiree violated it, the librarian can't do the same. \n\nAnother angle: the franchise right is for public utilities. The fence might interfere with that right. The franchise right includes ingress and egress for utilities. If the fence is blocking that, then it's a problem. But the fence is along the line between the librarian and teacher's lots, so maybe it's in the middle of the 10-foot strip. The fence could be obstructing the utility companies' access. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fence is within the 10-foot strip but not necessarily blocking utilities. But the covenant says no structures at all. So even if it's not blocking, the mere presence of a structure is prohibited. \n\nTherefore, the court would likely grant the injunction because the fence violates the recorded restrictions, and the librarian had notice of them. The prior violation by the retiree doesn't excuse the librarian's actions. \n\nWait, but maybe the teacher can't sue because they bought after the retiree's fence was already there? But the teacher's own lot's deed includes the restrictions, so they can enforce them against others. The teacher's own property rights are affected by the librarian's fence, so they have standing. \n\nAnother point: the franchise right is for public utilities. The fence might be a private structure, so even if it's on the franchise strip, it's a violation. The franchise is for public use, so private fences aren't allowed. \n\nTherefore, the court will probably side with the teacher and order the fence removed.\n</think>\n\nThe court will most likely **grant the mandatory injunction** to compel the removal of the librarian's fence. Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n### Key Legal Principles:\n1. **Recorded Restrictions and Constructive Notice**: The development plan was duly recorded in 1980, and all subsequent purchasers (including the retiree, teacher, and librarian) are charged with constructive notice of its terms. This means each owner is bound by the restrictions, even if they did not personally review the plan, as long as the plan was properly recorded and referenced in their deeds.\n\n2. **Prohibition on Structures in the Restricted Strip**: Restriction (23) explicitly states that **no house or structure of any kind shall be built on the 10-foot strip** reserved for public utility use. The librarian\u2019s post-and-rail fence is a \"structure\" within the meaning of this restriction, regardless of its size or purpose.\n\n3. **Enforcement Against Subsequent Owners**: Prior violations (e.g., the retiree\u2019s fence) do not negate the enforceability of the restrictions against subsequent owners. The librarian, having acquired the property after the plan was recorded and referenced in their deed, cannot rely on prior violations to justify their own breach.\n\n4. **Public Utility Franchise Rights**: Restriction (22) grants a franchise right to public utility companies over the 10-foot strip, including ingress and egress. The fence could obstruct this right, even if it does not physically block access, because its presence violates the covenant\u2019s prohibition on structures. Private encroachments on such easements are generally prohibited unless explicitly permitted.\n\n### Analysis of the Teacher\u2019s Claim:\n- **Standing**: The teacher has standing to enforce the restrictions because they are a subsequent owner bound by the plan and the fence directly encroaches on the shared restricted area adjacent to their property.\n- **Violation of Covenant**: The librarian\u2019s fence is a structure built on the restricted strip, violating Restriction (23). Even if the retiree\u2019s prior fence was noncompliant, this does not excuse the librarian\u2019s actions.\n- **Remedy via Injunction**: Courts typically grant injunctive relief to enforce restrictive covenants when there is a clear violation, especially where the covenant\u2019s purpose (preserving utility access and uniformity) is undermined by the structure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe court will likely rule in favor of the teacher, ordering the librarian to remove the fence. The recorded restrictions are enforceable against all owners, and the fence\u2019s presence violates the explicit terms of the development plan. Prior violations by other lot owners do not invalidate the covenant\u2019s applicability to the librarian. \n\n**Answer:** The court will most likely **grant the mandatory injunction** to remove the fence."
