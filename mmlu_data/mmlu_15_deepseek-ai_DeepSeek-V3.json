        "response": "Beyond the business case for engaging in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), there are several moral arguments relating to: **negative externalities**, the **power and influence** that corporations possess, and the **interdependence** of business and society. \n\n1. **Negative Externalities**: Corporations often create unintended harmful effects on society or the environment (e.g., pollution, resource depletion). CSR addresses these impacts by encouraging businesses to mitigate harm and take responsibility for their actions.\n\n2. **Power and Influence**: Corporations wield significant economic, social, and political power. With this power comes a moral obligation to act responsibly and contribute positively to society, rather than exploiting their influence for purely self-interested gains.\n\n3. **Interdependence**: Businesses and society are deeply interconnected. The long-term success of corporations depends on the health and stability of the communities and environments in which they operate. CSR recognizes this mutual reliance and promotes actions that benefit both business and society."
