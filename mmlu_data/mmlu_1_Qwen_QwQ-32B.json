        "question": "Statement 1 | If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. Statement 2 | If H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether these two statements about group theory are true or false. Let me start with Statement 1: \"If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|.\" Hmm, factor groups... right, those are quotient groups, like G/H when H is a normal subgroup of G. The elements of the factor group are the cosets aH. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that the element raised to the nth power is the identity. \n\nSo, first, let me recall that in the factor group G/H, the order of the coset aH is the smallest positive integer n such that (aH)^n = H. Since (aH)^n = a^n H, so we need a^n H = H, which implies that a^n is in H. Therefore, the order of aH is the smallest n such that a^n is in H. \n\nNow, the order of a in G is the smallest positive integer m such that a^m = e, the identity element. So the question is, does the order of aH divide the order of a? Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose G is a cyclic group of order 6, say G = Z_6, and let H be a subgroup of order 2, say H = {0, 3}. Then the factor group G/H has elements {0+H, 1+H, 2+H}, each of order 2, 3, and 3 respectively? Wait, let me check. \n\nWait, actually, in Z_6/H, the order of the coset 1 + H would be the smallest n such that n*(1) is in H. Since H is {0,3}, so 1*1=1 not in H, 2*1=2 not in H, 3*1=3 which is in H. So the order of 1 + H is 3. The order of 1 in Z_6 is 6. So 3 divides 6, which is true here. \n\nAnother element: take 2 + H. The order would be the smallest n where n*2 is in H. 2*1=2 not in H, 2*2=4 not in H, 2*3=6 \u22610 mod 6, which is in H. So order 3 again. The order of 2 in Z_6 is 3, so 3 divides 3, which is okay. \n\nWhat about 0 + H? That's the identity in G/H, so its order is 1, which divides the order of 0 in G, which is 1. So that works too. \n\nHmm, so in this case, the orders do divide. Maybe Statement 1 is true? Wait, let me think of another example where maybe it's not. \n\nSuppose G is S_3, the symmetric group on 3 elements, and let H be a normal subgroup. The normal subgroups of S_3 are A_3 and the trivial subgroup and S_3 itself. Let me take H = A_3, which has order 3. Then G/H has order 2, so the cosets are H and the coset of any odd permutation, say (12)H. The order of (12)H in G/H is 2, since (12)H squared is H. The order of (12) in S_3 is 2, so 2 divides 2, okay. \n\nWhat if H is the trivial subgroup? Then G/H is just G, so the order of any element in G/H is the same as in G, so trivially divides itself. \n\nHmm, maybe another example where H is not trivial but maybe the order doesn't divide? Let me think of a non-abelian group. Let's take G = D4, the dihedral group of order 8. Let H be a subgroup of order 2, say the subgroup generated by a reflection, but wait, is that normal? In D4, the center is of order 2, so only the subgroup generated by the rotation by 180 degrees is normal? Wait, actually, in D4, the subgroups of order 2: the rotations by 180 degrees is normal, but the reflections are not. So if I take H as the subgroup generated by a reflection, which is not normal, then G/H isn't a factor group. So I need H to be normal. \n\nLet me pick H as the center, which is {e, r^2} where r is rotation. Then G/H has order 4. Let me take an element a in G, say a reflection s. The order of s in G is 2. The coset sH in G/H has order... Let's see, (sH)^2 = s^2 H = e H = H, so the order is 2. Which divides 2, so that's okay. \n\nAnother element: take r, the rotation by 90 degrees. Its order in G is 4. The coset rH in G/H. Let's compute (rH)^n = r^n H. The order of rH is the smallest n where r^n is in H. Since H is {e, r^2}, so r^2 is in H. So the order of rH is 2, since r^2 is in H. The order of r in G is 4, so 2 divides 4, which is true. \n\nHmm, so in these examples, it seems to hold. Maybe Statement 1 is true? Wait, but let me think of a case where maybe the order of aH is larger than |a|? Wait, but the order of aH can't be larger than |a|, because if a^m = e, then (aH)^m = a^m H = eH = H, so the order of aH divides m. Therefore, the order of aH must divide the order of a. Wait, so actually, that seems to be a general proof. \n\nLet me formalize that. Suppose the order of a in G is m, so a^m = e. Then (aH)^m = a^m H = eH = H, which is the identity in G/H. Therefore, the order of aH must divide m, since the order is the minimal n such that (aH)^n = H. Therefore, the order of aH divides the order of a. So Statement 1 is true? \n\nWait, but hold on. What if the order of a is infinite? Then the statement says that the order of aH divides the order of a, but if |a| is infinite, then the statement would still hold vacuously? Because in that case, the order of aH could be finite or infinite. Wait, but if |a| is infinite, then the order of aH could still be finite. For example, suppose G is the group of integers under addition, H is a subgroup like 2Z. Then take a = 1. The coset a + H is 1 + 2Z. The order of 1 in G is infinite, but the order of 1 + 2Z in G/H is 2, which divides infinity? Hmm, but in the context of group theory, when we talk about dividing orders, we usually consider finite groups or elements of finite order. Maybe the problem assumes that a has finite order? \n\nThe problem didn't specify, but in the original statements, they just say \"If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|.\" So if a has infinite order, then |aH| could be finite, but does \"divides\" make sense here? Since infinity isn't a number, maybe the problem is considering only elements of finite order. Alternatively, maybe in the problem's context, they are working with finite groups. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is still true in general. Let me think again. If a has infinite order, then |aH| divides |a| would mean that the order of aH divides infinity, which is trivially true because any finite number divides infinity? Not sure. But maybe the problem is intended for finite groups. Since in the examples I considered earlier, it worked. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a case where the order of aH does not divide |a|. Let me think of an example where that might happen. Suppose G is the cyclic group of order 4, so Z_4, and H is the subgroup of order 2, so H = {0, 2}. Then the factor group G/H has two elements: 0+H and 1+H. The order of 1+H is 2, since adding it twice gives 2+H = H. The order of 1 in G is 4, so 2 divides 4, which is okay. \n\nAnother example: Let G be Z_6 again, H = {0, 3}. Take a = 2, which has order 3 in G. The coset 2 + H has order 3, which divides 3. \n\nHmm, maybe I can't find a counterexample. Let me think of a non-abelian group. Let G = S_3, H = A_3, which is normal. Take an element of order 3 in G, say (123). Its order is 3. The coset (123)H is just H, since (123) is in H. So the order of H in G/H is 1, which divides 3. \n\nTake an element of order 2, say (12). The coset (12)H has order 2 in G/H, since (12)H squared is H. The order of (12) is 2, so 2 divides 2. \n\nHmm, still holds. Maybe Statement 1 is indeed true. Wait, but let me think of a case where H contains a power of a. Suppose G is Z_4 again, H = {0, 2}. Let a = 1, which has order 4. Then aH has order 2, which divides 4. \n\nAlternatively, take G = Z_8, H = {0,4}. Let a = 2, which has order 4 in G. Then aH = {2,6}. The order of aH in G/H is 2, since adding it twice gives 4 + H = H. 2 divides 4, so okay. \n\nAlternatively, take a = 3 in Z_8. Order of 3 is 8/gcd(3,8)=8, so infinite? Wait no, in Z_8, every element has finite order. The order of 3 is 8 / gcd(3,8)=8, since gcd(3,8)=1. Wait, no, in additive group Z_8, the order of an element a is 8 / gcd(a,8). So for 3, gcd(3,8)=1, so order 8. Then aH = 3 + H = {3,7}. The order of this coset is the smallest n where n*3 mod 8 is in H. H is {0,4}. Let's see n=2: 6 mod8=6 not in H. n=4: 12 mod8=4, which is in H. So order is 4. 4 divides 8, so yes. \n\nHmm, so even here, it works. Maybe Statement 1 is indeed true. \n\nWait, but let me think of a case where H is trivial. Then G/H is G itself, so the order of aH is the same as the order of a, so trivially divides. \n\nAlternatively, if H is the entire group G, then the factor group is trivial, so the only element is H itself, which has order 1. The order of aH is 1, which divides |a|. \n\nSo in all these cases, it seems to hold. Therefore, maybe Statement 1 is true. \n\nNow moving on to Statement 2: \"If H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G.\" Hmm, I remember that the product HK of two subgroups is a subgroup if and only if one is contained in the other, or more generally, if HK = KH. But in general, just because H and K are subgroups doesn't mean their product is a subgroup. \n\nLet me recall the theorem: HK is a subgroup if and only if HK = KH. So unless H and K normalize each other, their product might not be a subgroup. \n\nLet me think of a simple example where HK is not a subgroup. Let G be S_3, the symmetric group on 3 elements. Let H be the subgroup generated by (12), so H = {e, (12)}, and K be the subgroup generated by (13), so K = {e, (13)}. Then HK consists of all products h*k where h is in H and k is in K. Let's list them:\n\ne*e = e,\n\ne*(13) = (13),\n\n(12)*e = (12),\n\n(12)*(13) = (12)(13) = (132).\n\nSimilarly, K*H would be:\n\ne*e = e,\n\n(13)*e = (13),\n\ne*(12) = (12),\n\n(13)*(12) = (13)(12) = (123).\n\nSo HK has elements {e, (12), (13), (132)}, and KH has elements {e, (13), (12), (123)}. So HK and KH are different? Wait, actually, (132) and (123) are different elements. So HK is not equal to KH. Therefore, HK is not a subgroup because it's not closed under the group operation. Let me check if HK is closed. \n\nTake (12) and (13) in HK. Their product is (12)(13) = (132), which is in HK. But if we take (132) and (12), multiplying them: (132)(12) = (132)(12) = (1)(23) = (23), which is not in HK. Wait, (23) is not in HK. Wait, let me compute again. \n\nWait, (132) is in HK, and (12) is in HK. Multiplying (132)*(12): Let's see, (132) is the permutation 1\u21923, 3\u21922, 2\u21921. Then (12) swaps 1 and 2. So applying (12) first: 1\u21942, then (132): 1\u21923, 2\u21921, 3\u21922. So overall: starting with 1: first swap to 2, then 2\u21921, so 1\u21921? Wait, no, maybe better to compute step by step. \n\nLet me compute (132)(12) as permutations. Let's apply (12) first, then (132). \n\nStart with 1: (12) sends 1 to 2, then (132) sends 2 to 1. So overall 1\u21921.\n\nStart with 2: (12) sends 2 to 1, then (132) sends 1 to 3. So 2\u21923.\n\nStart with 3: (12) leaves 3, then (132) sends 3 to 2. So 3\u21922.\n\nThus the permutation is (2 3), which is (23). But (23) is not in HK. Since HK has elements e, (12), (13), (132). So (23) is not there, so HK is not closed under the group operation. Therefore HK is not a subgroup. \n\nTherefore Statement 2 is false. \n\nAlternatively, another example: Let G be the Klein 4-group, which is abelian. Let H and K be two distinct subgroups of order 2. Then HK would be the entire group, which is a subgroup. Wait, in the Klein 4-group, every pair of subgroups of order 2 would generate the whole group, which is a subgroup. Hmm, so in abelian groups, HK is a subgroup if H and K are subgroups? Wait, in abelian groups, HK is always a subgroup because HK = KH. Since the group is abelian, so HK is closed. \n\nWait, so in non-abelian groups, it can fail, but in abelian groups, it works. So the statement is not always true. Since there exists at least one case where it's false, the statement is false. \n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more for Statement 1. Suppose a has infinite order. Then |aH| divides |a|. If |a| is infinite, then the statement is vacuously true? Or does it require that |aH| divides |a| even if |a| is infinite? \n\nIn group theory, when we say that the order of an element divides another order, it's typically in the context of finite groups. If the element has infinite order, then the statement that the order of aH divides |a| would mean that the order of aH is finite and divides infinity, which is a bit nonsensical. However, in the problem statement, it just says \"If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|.\" \n\nBut in the case where a has infinite order, the order of aH could be finite. For example, take G = Z (the integers under addition), H = 2Z. Let a = 1. Then aH = 1 + 2Z. The order of aH in G/H is 2, since 2*(1 + 2Z) = 2Z = H. The order of a in G is infinite. So 2 divides infinity? That doesn't make sense in the usual sense. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem assumes that a has finite order. If that's the case, then the statement holds. Since in all the examples with finite order elements, it worked. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended for finite groups. Since in the question, they just mention \"a factor group\" without specifying, but factor groups can be of any group. \n\nHowever, in the problem statement, since they are talking about the order of aH and the order of a, perhaps they are considering elements of finite order. Since otherwise, the divisibility doesn't make sense. \n\nTherefore, under the assumption that a has finite order, Statement 1 is true. Since the problem didn't specify, but in standard group theory, when talking about orders of elements, if an element has infinite order, its order is considered to be infinity, and the order of aH would have to divide that, which is only possible if the order of aH is also infinite or a finite divisor of infinity, which isn't really defined. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is intended for finite groups, so Statement 1 is true. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case even with finite groups where the order of aH doesn't divide |a|. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose G is the quaternion group Q8: {\u00b11, \u00b1i, \u00b1j, \u00b1k}. Let H be the subgroup {1, -1}. Let a = i. The order of a in G is 4. The coset aH is {i, -i}. The order of this coset in Q8/H is 2, since (iH)^2 = i^2 H = (-1)H = H. So 2 divides 4, okay. \n\nAnother element: take a = j. Similarly, order 4, coset order 2. \n\nTake an element of order 2, say -1. Wait, but -1 is in H, so its coset is H itself, which has order 1. 1 divides 2, okay. \n\nHmm, still holds. \n\nAlternatively, take G = S_3, H = {e, (123), (132)}, which is A_3. Let a = (12). Order of a is 2. The coset aH is {(12), (12)(123), (12)(132)}. Let me compute those: (12)(123) = (13), and (12)(132) = (23). So the coset is {(12), (13), (23)}. The order of this coset in G/H is... Well, G/H has two elements: H and aH. So the order of aH is 2, which divides 2. \n\nOkay, so even here, it works. \n\nHmm, so unless there's some tricky example I'm missing, Statement 1 seems to hold. \n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. \n\n**Final Answer**\nStatement 1: \\boxed{True}  \nStatement 2: \\boxed{False}\n</think>\n\n### Statement 1 Analysis:\nTo determine if the order of the coset \\(aH\\) in the factor group \\(G/H\\) divides the order of \\(a\\) in \\(G\\), we start by noting that the order of \\(aH\\) is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\((aH)^n = H\\). This implies \\(a^n \\in H\\). \n\nGiven the order of \\(a\\) in \\(G\\) is \\(m\\), we have \\(a^m = e\\). Therefore, \\((aH)^m = a^m H = eH = H\\), meaning the order of \\(aH\\) must divide \\(m\\). This holds true even if \\(a\\) has infinite order, as the order of \\(aH\\) would still be a divisor of \\(m\\) in the context of finite orders. Examples in cyclic groups, symmetric groups, and dihedral groups confirm this. Thus, Statement 1 is true.\n\n### Statement 2 Analysis:\nTo check if \\(HK\\) is a subgroup whenever \\(H\\) and \\(K\\) are subgroups of \\(G\\), we recall that \\(HK\\) is a subgroup if and only if \\(HK = KH\\). A counterexample in \\(S_3\\) shows this is not always true. Let \\(H = \\langle (12) \\rangle\\) and \\(K = \\langle (13) \\rangle\\). Their product \\(HK\\) is not closed under the group operation, as shown by the element \\((23)\\) not being in \\(HK\\). Thus, \\(HK\\) is not a subgroup, proving Statement 2 is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nStatement 1: \\boxed{True}  \nStatement 2: \\boxed{False}"
