        "question": "Which of the following is expected to be a polar molecule?",
        "response": "To determine if a molecule is polar, you need to consider the electronegativity of the atoms involved and the molecular geometry. A polar molecule has a net dipole moment due to the unequal sharing of electrons between atoms. Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Electronegativity Difference**: If there is a significant difference in electronegativity between the atoms, the molecule is likely to be polar. For example, HCl (hydrogen chloride) is polar because chlorine is more electronegative than hydrogen.\n\n2. **Molecular Geometry**: The shape of the molecule also plays a crucial role. Even if the atoms have different electronegativities, the molecule might not be polar if the arrangement of atoms cancels out the dipole moments. For instance, CO2 (carbon dioxide) is nonpolar despite having polar bonds because the linear arrangement of the molecule results in the cancellation of the dipole moments.\n\n3. **Examples of Polar Molecules**:\n   - H2O (water): Water has a bent shape and the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, making it polar.\n   - NH3 (ammonia): Ammonia has a trigonal pyramidal shape and the nitrogen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, making it polar.\n   - CH3OH (methanol): Methanol has a tetrahedral shape around the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, making it polar.\n\n4. **Examples of Nonpolar Molecules**:\n   - CO2 (carbon dioxide): As mentioned earlier, even though the C=O bonds are polar, the linear shape of the molecule makes it nonpolar.\n   - CH4 (methane): Methane has a tetrahedral shape and the carbon atom is less electronegative than the hydrogen atoms, but the symmetry of the molecule makes it nonpolar.\n   - CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride): Carbon tetrachloride has a tetrahedral shape and the carbon atom is less electronegative than the chlorine atoms, but the symmetry of the molecule makes it nonpolar.\n\nIn summary, to determine if a molecule is polar, you need to consider both the electronegativity differences between the atoms and the molecular geometry."
