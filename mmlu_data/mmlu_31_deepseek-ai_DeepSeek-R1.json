        "question": "A 0.217 g sample of HgO (molar mass = 217 g) reacts with excess iodide ions according to the reaction shown above. Titration of the resulting solution requires how many mL of 0.10 M HCl to reach equivalence point?",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many milliliters of 0.10 M HCl are required to titrate the solution after the HgO reacts with excess iodide ions. Hmm, first, I should probably write down the reaction given, but since the user mentioned \"the reaction shown above\" and I don't see it here, maybe I need to recall common reactions involving HgO and iodide ions. \n\nWait, mercury(II) oxide reacting with iodide ions... I think the reaction might be something like HgO reacting with I\u207b to form some mercury iodide complex. Let me think. Mercury(II) oxide is a strong oxidizing agent, and iodide ions are good reducing agents. But maybe in this case, it's a simple acid-base reaction or a dissolution reaction. Alternatively, maybe HgO reacts with iodide in an acidic solution? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2I\u207b + H2O \u2192 HgI4\u00b2\u207b + 2OH\u207b? I remember that HgO can dissolve in solutions containing iodide ions to form the tetraiodomercurate(II) complex, releasing hydroxide ions. If that's the case, then the resulting solution would be basic because of the OH\u207b ions produced. Then, titration with HCl would neutralize the hydroxide ions. \n\nSo, if that's the reaction, then the amount of OH\u207b produced would determine how much HCl is needed. Let me confirm the stoichiometry. For every mole of HgO, how many moles of OH\u207b are produced? The reaction I wrote earlier shows 2 moles of OH\u207b per mole of HgO. \n\nGiven that, let's start calculating. The sample is 0.217 grams of HgO, and the molar mass is 217 g/mol. So moles of HgO = mass / molar mass = 0.217 g / 217 g/mol = 0.001 mol. \n\nSince each mole of HgO produces 2 moles of OH\u207b, then moles of OH\u207b = 0.001 mol * 2 = 0.002 mol. \n\nNow, titration with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it will react with OH\u207b in a 1:1 ratio: H\u207a + OH\u207b \u2192 H2O. Therefore, moles of HCl needed = moles of OH\u207b = 0.002 mol. \n\nThe concentration of HCl is 0.10 M, which is moles per liter. So volume (in liters) = moles / concentration = 0.002 mol / 0.10 mol/L = 0.02 L. Convert that to milliliters: 0.02 L * 1000 mL/L = 20 mL. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I missed anything. The reaction stoichiometry: HgO to OH\u207b is 1:2? If the reaction is indeed HgO + 2I\u207b + H2O \u2192 HgI4\u00b2\u207b + 2OH\u207b, then yes. So 1 mole HgO gives 2 moles OH\u207b. \n\nAnother thing to check: the molar mass of HgO. Mercury has a molar mass of about 200.59 g/mol, oxygen is 16.00 g/mol, so HgO is 200.59 + 16.00 = 216.59 g/mol, which rounds to 217 g/mol as given. So 0.217 g / 217 g/mol is indeed 0.001 mol. \n\nThen, moles of OH\u207b: 0.001 * 2 = 0.002 mol. HCl is 0.10 M, so 0.002 mol / 0.10 mol/L = 0.02 L = 20 mL. \n\nHmm, seems correct. But wait, maybe the reaction is different? Let me think again. If HgO reacts with excess iodide, maybe the reaction is:\n\nHgO + 4I\u207b + H2O \u2192 [HgI4]^2\u2212 + 2OH\u207b\n\nYes, that's the reaction I found earlier. So stoichiometry is 1 HgO to 2 OH\u207b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another reaction where HgO reacts with HI (hydroiodic acid), but since the problem states it's reacting with excess iodide ions, probably in aqueous solution, not necessarily acidic. So the dissolution of HgO in KI solution, forming the complex and hydroxide ions. \n\nTherefore, the hydroxide ions produced would require neutralization by HCl. So yes, 0.002 moles of HCl needed. \n\nTherefore, volume is 20 mL. \n\nWait, but let me check another possible reaction. Suppose the reaction is:\n\nHgO + 2I\u207b + 2H+ \u2192 HgI2 + H2O\n\nBut if that's the case, then H+ would be consumed. However, the problem states that the reaction is with excess iodide ions. If the solution is acidic, then maybe H+ is present. But the problem mentions titration with HCl to reach equivalence, so maybe the solution after reaction is basic, requiring acid to neutralize. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction produces some other species that need to be titrated. Wait, but the problem says \"titration of the resulting solution requires how many mL of 0.10 M HCl to reach equivalence point?\" So whatever is in the solution after HgO reacts with excess I\u207b needs to be titrated with HCl. \n\nIf the reaction produces OH\u207b ions, then HCl would neutralize them. If the reaction produces some basic species, like OH\u207b, then yes. Alternatively, if the reaction produces something else that reacts with H+, maybe I need to consider that. \n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is HgO + 2I\u207b + H2O \u2192 HgI2 + 2OH\u207b. But HgI2 is a precipitate, but in excess I\u207b, HgI2 might dissolve to form [HgI4]^2\u2212. So perhaps:\n\nHgO + 4I\u207b + H2O \u2192 [HgI4]^2\u2212 + 2OH\u207b\n\nSo that's the same as before. So 1 mole HgO gives 2 moles OH\u207b. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. \n\nSo, 0.217 g HgO is 0.001 mol, leading to 0.002 mol OH\u207b, which requires 0.002 mol HCl. Since HCl is 0.10 M, volume is 0.002 / 0.10 = 0.02 L = 20 mL. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20 mL. \n\nBut wait, let me check once more. Suppose I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let's write the balanced equation step by step. \n\nHgO is mercury(II) oxide. I\u207b is iodide ion. \n\nHgO reacting with I\u207b. Let's consider the dissolution of HgO in KI solution. \n\nThe reaction is: HgO(s) + 4I\u207b(aq) + H2O(l) \u2192 [HgI4]^2\u2212(aq) + 2OH\u207b(aq)\n\nBalanced? Let's check:\n\nLeft side: HgO has Hg^2+ and O^2\u2212. In solution, HgO can react with I\u207b. The mercury goes from +2 in HgO to +2 in [HgI4]^2\u2212, so no redox change. The iodide is just a ligand here. \n\nSo, HgO (Hg^2+ and O^2\u2212) plus 4I\u207b and H2O gives [HgI4]^2\u2212 and 2OH\u207b. \n\nYes, the charges balance: Left side: 4*(-1) = -4. Right side: -2 (from [HgI4]^2\u2212) + 2*(-1) from OH\u207b = -2 -2 = -4. So charges balance. \n\nNumber of atoms:\n\nHg: 1 left, 1 right.\n\nO: 1 (from HgO) + 1 (from H2O) = 2. On the right: 2 OH\u207b has 2 O. So O balances.\n\nH: 2 from H2O. On the right: 2 OH\u207b has 2 H. So H balances.\n\nI: 4 left, 4 right. \n\nSo the reaction is balanced. \n\nTherefore, per mole of HgO, 2 moles of OH\u207b are produced. \n\nThus, moles of OH\u207b = 2 * moles of HgO = 2 * (0.217 g / 217 g/mol) = 2 * 0.001 mol = 0.002 mol. \n\nHCl reacts with OH\u207b in a 1:1 ratio: H+ + OH\u207b \u2192 H2O. \n\nSo moles HCl needed = 0.002 mol. \n\nVolume HCl = moles / concentration = 0.002 mol / 0.10 mol/L = 0.02 L = 20 mL. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. The key was figuring out the correct reaction, but given the information, the reaction producing OH\u207b ions makes sense, and the stoichiometry adds up. Therefore, the required volume is 20 mL.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe required volume of 0.10 M HCl is \\boxed{20} mL."
