She argues that the very absurdity of these scenarios underscores their inadequacy as a basis for justifying extreme measures, such as torture. By pointing out the implausibility and moral oversimplification of the ticking bomb hypothetical, Baron suggests that it fails to provide a reliable or ethical framework for decision-making in real-world situations. Instead, she likely advocates for more nuanced and morally consistent approaches to addressing complex ethical dilemmas."
