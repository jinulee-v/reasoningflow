        "question": "Consider the following AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance\n\nyt = 0.2 + 0.4 yt-1 + ut\n\nThe (unconditional) mean of y will be given by",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the unconditional mean of y for this AR(1) model. Let me recall what an AR(1) model is. It stands for Autoregressive model of order 1, right? The general form is y_t = c + \u03c6 y_{t-1} + u_t, where c is a constant, \u03c6 is the coefficient, and u_t is the error term with some properties\u2014here it has zero mean and unit variance. \n\nThe question is about the unconditional mean of y. Hmm, unconditional mean is like the long-run average value of the series, right? So even though the model is dependent on the previous value, over time, if the process is stationary, it should converge to some mean. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the process is stationary. For an AR(1) model, the condition for stationarity is that the absolute value of the coefficient \u03c6 is less than 1. In this case, \u03c6 is 0.4, which is definitely less than 1 in absolute value. So the process is stationary, which means the unconditional mean exists and is constant over time. \n\nNow, how do we compute the unconditional mean? I remember that for a stationary AR(1) process, the unconditional mean \u03bc can be found by solving the equation \u03bc = c + \u03c6 \u03bc. Because in the long run, y_t and y_{t-1} both equal the mean \u03bc. So substituting into the equation:\n\n\u03bc = 0.2 + 0.4 \u03bc\n\nThen, solving for \u03bc. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\n\u03bc - 0.4 \u03bc = 0.2\n\n0.6 \u03bc = 0.2\n\nSo \u03bc = 0.2 / 0.6\n\nDividing both numerator and denominator by 0.2 gives 1/3. So \u03bc = 1/3 \u2248 0.333...\n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense. If the coefficient is 0.4, then the influence of the previous term diminishes over time, and the constant term 0.2 would contribute to the mean. Since each term adds 0.2 plus 0.4 times the previous term, the mean should be higher than 0.2, right? Because 0.4 times the mean is added each time. So solving \u03bc = 0.2 + 0.4 \u03bc gives \u03bc = 0.2 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.2 / 0.6 = 1/3. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the sum of a geometric series. The process can be written as y_t = 0.4 y_{t-1} + 0.2 + u_t. If we keep expanding this recursively:\n\ny_t = 0.2 + 0.4 y_{t-1} + u_t  \n= 0.2 + 0.4 (0.2 + 0.4 y_{t-2} + u_{t-1}) + u_t  \n= 0.2 + 0.4*0.2 + 0.4^2 y_{t-2} + 0.4 u_{t-1} + u_t  \nContinuing this indefinitely, since it's stationary, the effect of the initial term y_0 would die out because 0.4^n approaches zero as n increases. So the expectation of y_t would be the sum of the constants: 0.2 + 0.4*0.2 + 0.4^2*0.2 + ... which is a geometric series with first term a = 0.2 and common ratio r = 0.4. The sum is a / (1 - r) = 0.2 / (1 - 0.4) = 0.2 / 0.6 = 1/3. That matches the previous result. \n\nAlso, the disturbances u_t have zero mean, so when taking expectations, those terms drop out. Therefore, the unconditional mean is indeed 1/3. \n\nLet me verify with another approach. Suppose we take expectations on both sides of the original equation:\n\nE[y_t] = E[0.2 + 0.4 y_{t-1} + u_t]\n\nSince expectation is linear, this becomes:\n\nE[y_t] = 0.2 + 0.4 E[y_{t-1}] + E[u_t]\n\nBut E[u_t] = 0, so:\n\nE[y_t] = 0.2 + 0.4 E[y_{t-1}]\n\nIf the process is stationary, then E[y_t] = E[y_{t-1}] = \u03bc. Therefore:\n\n\u03bc = 0.2 + 0.4 \u03bc\n\nWhich again gives \u03bc = 0.2 / 0.6 = 1/3. \n\nSo all methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, the unconditional mean of y is 1/3. \n\nI think that's solid. The key was recognizing that for a stationary AR(1) process, the unconditional mean can be found by solving \u03bc = c + \u03c6 \u03bc. Since \u03c6 is 0.4 here, which is less than 1, the process is stationary, and the formula applies. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes: 0.2 divided by (1 - 0.4) is 0.2 divided by 0.6. 0.2 divided by 0.6 is the same as 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo the answer should be 1/3, or approximately 0.3333.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe unconditional mean of \\( y \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}."
