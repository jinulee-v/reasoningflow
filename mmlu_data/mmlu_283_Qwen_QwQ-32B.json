        "question": " Which Japanese government promoted a kind of national cult based on the emperor and his associations with kami?",
        "response": "Okay, so the question is asking which Japanese government promoted a national cult based on the emperor and his associations with kami. Hmm, I need to recall my history here. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that Japan has a long history with the emperor system. The term \"kami\" refers to the Shinto deities, right? So the question is about a government that linked the emperor to these kami in a cult-like way. \n\nI think this might be related to the Meiji Restoration period. The Meiji government started in 1868, right? They centralized power and tried to modernize Japan. But how does that connect to a national cult?\n\nWait, during the Meiji era, Shinto was promoted as the state religion. The emperor was considered a divine figure, a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu. So maybe the Meiji government is the one they're referring to. But I should be careful here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the government during the pre-WWII era, like the 1930s and 1940s, when Japan was more militaristic. The state Shinto system was enforced then, requiring worship of the emperor as a kami. That sounds like a national cult. \n\nWait, but wasn't state Shinto formalized during the Meiji period? Let me check the timeline. The Meiji government did establish State Shinto, which emphasized the emperor's divinity. The 1889 Meiji Constitution declared the emperor as a living god. Then in the early 20th century, especially leading up to WWII, the government under the military leaders pushed this even more, promoting emperor worship as part of national unity and militarism. \n\nSo the question is asking which government specifically. The answer might be the Meiji government, but the cult aspect became more pronounced later. However, the term \"national cult\" might refer to the system established during Meiji, which was then expanded upon in the pre-WWII period. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the government during the Sh\u014dwa era (Hirohito's reign), which included the pre-WWII period. The term \"State Shinto\" was the official state religion enforced by the government, which required worship of the emperor as a kami. \n\nWait, but when exactly was State Shinto established? The Meiji government did establish the framework, but the actual enforcement and the cult-like aspects might have been more during the 1930s and 1940s. \n\nI think the key here is that the Meiji government started the state Shinto system, making the emperor a central figure in Shinto rituals and national identity. The later militarist government in the 1930s and 1940s took this further, using it to promote ultranationalism and the emperor's divine status as part of their propaganda. \n\nHowever, the question is phrased as \"which Japanese government,\" so maybe the answer is the Meiji government. But I need to confirm. Let me think again. The Meiji Constitution (1889) did enshrine the emperor's divine status. The government during the Meiji period promoted Shinto as a state religion, which tied the emperor to the kami. \n\nAlternatively, the term \"national cult\" might specifically refer to the more extreme form during the pre-WWII era. But perhaps the question is looking for the Meiji government as the originator. \n\nWait, another angle: the term \"State Shinto\" (Kokka Shinto) was the system established by the Meiji government to unify the country under Shinto and the emperor. So that's probably the answer. The Meiji government promoted this national cult. \n\nBut I should also consider that after the Meiji period, especially in the 1930s, the government under the military leaders intensified this, but the foundation was laid by the Meiji. Since the question is about which government promoted it, the Meiji government is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the government during the 1930s-1940s, but I think the key term here is \"national cult based on the emperor and kami,\" which was the Meiji government's policy. \n\nWait, but after the Meiji period, during the Taisho and Showa eras, the state Shinto continued and was used for nationalism. However, the question might be looking for the Meiji government as the one that initiated it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is the government during the Shinto Revival Movement, but that's part of the Meiji era. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is the Meiji government. Let me confirm with some key points: \n\n- Meiji Restoration (1868) ended the Tokugawa shogunate, restored imperial rule. \n- The Meiji government promoted State Shinto to unify the country, emphasizing the emperor's divine lineage. \n- The emperor was considered a kami, and Shinto became the state religion. \n- This led to the development of a nationalistic ideology that was later exploited by militarists in the 20th century. \n\nTherefore, the Meiji government is the one that established this system. The later governments built upon it, but the question is about which government promoted it, so Meiji is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe Japanese government that promoted a national cult based on the emperor and his associations with kami was the **Meiji government** (1868\u20131912). This system, known as **State Shinto** (Kokka Shinto), was formalized during the Meiji Restoration to centralize authority under the emperor and foster national unity through Shinto practices. Key aspects include:\n\n1. **Divine Status of the Emperor**: The Meiji Constitution (1889) declared the emperor as a living descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, a kami in Shinto belief, thereby elevating him to a near-divine status.\n   \n2. **State-Enforced Religion**: Shinto was established as the state religion, with rituals and shrines (e.g., Yasukuni Shrine) used to reinforce loyalty to the emperor and the state. Education and military systems were infused with Shinto practices to instill imperial devotion.\n\n3. **National Identity**: The cult emphasized Japan's uniqueness and superiority, framing the emperor as the symbolic and spiritual leader of the nation. This ideology was later exploited by pre-WWII militarist regimes to justify ultranationalism and expansionism.\n\nWhile the militarist government of the 1930s\u20131940s intensified these ideas, the foundational structure of the emperor-centric national cult originated with the **Meiji government**, which institutionalized the emperor's divine role as part of modernizing and unifying Japan."
