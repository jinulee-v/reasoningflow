        "question": "When 'consent' can serve as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of a State conduct?",
        "response": "Consent is a circumstance precluding wrongfulness when it is given by a State capable of consenting to the conduct in question and when the content of the consent is not otherwise prohibited by international law. Consent must be given freely and without coercion. It must also be specific and informed, meaning that the State giving consent must be fully aware of the nature and consequences of the conduct to which it is consenting. Consent may be given expressly or impliedly, but it must be unequivocal and unambiguous. Once consent is given, it may be withdrawn at any time, but the withdrawal of consent does not affect the validity of the conduct to which consent was given prior to the withdrawal."
