        "question": "One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two Nichrome wires connected together. One is longer and has a certain cross-sectional area, and the other is shorter with a different cross-sectional area. The question is asking for the potential at the junction where they meet. Let me try to visualize this setup first.\n\nAlright, the longer wire has a length of 2L and a cross-sectional area A. The shorter one is length L and area 2A. One end of the longer wire is at 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at 1.0 volt. So, the two wires are connected at their other ends, forming a sort of chain: 8V ----(2L, A)---- Junction ----(L, 2A)---- 1V.\n\nHmm, since they're connected, the current flowing through both wires should be the same, right? Because there's only one path for the current. So, the current through the longer wire is equal to the current through the shorter wire. That makes sense. So, maybe I can use Ohm's Law here. But first, I need to find the resistances of each wire.\n\nNichrome has a certain resistivity, which I think is given by the symbol \u03c1 (rho). The resistance of a wire is given by R = \u03c1 * (length / area). So, for the longer wire, its resistance R1 would be \u03c1*(2L)/A, and for the shorter wire, R2 would be \u03c1*L/(2A). Let me write that down:\n\nR1 = \u03c1*(2L)/A\n\nR2 = \u03c1*L/(2A)\n\nSimplifying these:\n\nR1 = 2\u03c1L/A\n\nR2 = \u03c1L/(2A)\n\nSo, R1 is four times larger than R2? Wait, let's check:\n\nIf R1 is 2\u03c1L/A and R2 is \u03c1L/(2A), then R1/R2 = (2\u03c1L/A) / (\u03c1L/(2A)) = (2 / (1/2)) = 4. Yes, R1 is four times R2. So, the longer wire has four times the resistance of the shorter one.\n\nNow, since the same current flows through both resistors, the potential drop across each resistor will be proportional to their resistances. The total potential difference across the entire system is 8.0V - 1.0V = 7.0V. This total voltage will be divided between the two resistors in proportion to their resistances.\n\nWait, but how exactly is the potential distributed here? Let me think. The current flows from the higher potential (8V) to the lower potential (1V). So, starting at 8V, the current goes through R1 (the longer wire), drops some voltage across it, reaches the junction, then goes through R2 (the shorter wire), drops the remaining voltage across it, and ends up at 1V.\n\nSo, the potential at the junction will be 8V minus the voltage drop across R1, and it will also be equal to 1V plus the voltage drop across R2. Since the current through both is the same, let's denote the current as I.\n\nSo, Ohm's Law tells us that V = IR. Therefore, the voltage drop across R1 is I*R1, and the voltage drop across R2 is I*R2.\n\nSo, starting from 8V: Junction potential = 8V - I*R1\n\nStarting from 1V: Junction potential = 1V + I*R2\n\nSince both expressions equal the junction potential, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n8V - I*R1 = 1V + I*R2\n\nSolving for I:\n\n8V - 1V = I*R1 + I*R2\n\n7V = I*(R1 + R2)\n\nTherefore, I = 7V / (R1 + R2)\n\nOnce we find I, we can plug it back into either equation to find the junction potential.\n\nAlternatively, since R1 is four times R2, let's substitute R1 = 4R2 into the equation.\n\nSo, R1 + R2 = 4R2 + R2 = 5R2\n\nTherefore, I = 7V / (5R2)\n\nThen, the voltage drop across R2 is I*R2 = (7V / 5R2)*R2 = 7V/5 = 1.4V\n\nTherefore, the junction potential is 1V + 1.4V = 2.4V\n\nAlternatively, using the other expression: 8V - I*R1\n\nSince R1 = 4R2, then I*R1 = (7V / 5R2)*4R2 = 28V/5 = 5.6V\n\nTherefore, junction potential = 8V - 5.6V = 2.4V\n\nSo, either way, the potential at the junction is 2.4 volts. Hmm, 2.4 is 12/5, which is 2.4. So, 2.4 volts.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's compute R1 and R2 properly.\n\nGiven that both wires are made of Nichrome, so same resistivity \u03c1.\n\nFirst wire: length 2L, area A. So, R1 = \u03c1*(2L)/A\n\nSecond wire: length L, area 2A. So, R2 = \u03c1*L/(2A)\n\nSo, R1/R2 = [2L/A] / [L/(2A)] = (2L/A)*(2A/L) = 4. So, R1 = 4R2. Correct.\n\nTotal resistance R_total = R1 + R2 = 4R2 + R2 = 5R2\n\nTotal voltage V_total = 8V - 1V = 7V\n\nCurrent I = V_total / R_total = 7V / 5R2\n\nVoltage drop across R2: V2 = I*R2 = (7V / 5R2)*R2 = 7V/5 = 1.4V\n\nTherefore, the potential at the junction is 1V + 1.4V = 2.4V\n\nAlternatively, voltage drop across R1: V1 = I*R1 = (7V / 5R2)*4R2 = 28V/5 = 5.6V\n\nTherefore, junction potential is 8V - 5.6V = 2.4V\n\nSo, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the potential at the junction is 2.4 volts. But the answer choices might be in fractions or something else. Wait, the problem says \"most nearly equal to\" and the options are probably given in the original problem, but since it's not here, but in the initial problem statement, maybe 2.4 is the answer. But let me check again.\n\nWait, 2.4 is 12/5, which is 2.4. Alternatively, 7V divided in a 4:1 ratio? Wait, the total resistance is 5R2, so the ratio of voltage drops is R1:R2 = 4:1. Therefore, the voltage across R1 is 4/5 of 7V, which is 5.6V, and across R2 is 1/5 of 7V, which is 1.4V. So, yes, that adds up to 7V. So, the junction is at 8V - 5.6V = 2.4V, or 1V + 1.4V = 2.4V. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is the current really the same through both resistors? Since they are connected in series, yes. Because there's no branching, so the current through R1 must equal the current through R2. Therefore, the analysis is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I model this as a series circuit with two resistors, R1 and R2, connected between 8V and 1V. So, the total voltage across the two resistors is 7V, and the potential at the junction is determined by the voltage divider between R1 and R2.\n\nIn a voltage divider, the voltage at the junction is V = V_high - (V_high - V_low)*(R1)/(R1 + R2). Wait, let me recall the voltage divider formula.\n\nThe standard voltage divider formula is V_out = V_in * (R2 / (R1 + R2)) when R1 is connected to V_in and R2 is connected to ground. But in this case, it's between 8V and 1V, so maybe it's a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, think of the two resistors in series between 8V and 1V. The potential difference across the entire combination is 7V. The current is 7V/(R1 + R2). Then, the potential at the junction can be calculated starting from 8V and subtracting the voltage drop across R1, which is I*R1.\n\nAlternatively, starting from 1V and adding the voltage drop across R2, which is I*R2. Either way, as done before.\n\nSo, since R1 is four times R2, the voltage drop across R1 is four times that across R2. Wait, but the total voltage drop is 7V. So, if V1 = 4*V2, then V1 + V2 = 4V2 + V2 = 5V2 = 7V => V2 = 7/5 V = 1.4V, V1 = 28/5 V = 5.6V. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the junction potential is 8V - 5.6V = 2.4V, or 1V + 1.4V = 2.4V. So, 2.4 volts is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I messed up the resistances. Let me recalculate R1 and R2.\n\nFirst wire: length 2L, area A. Resistance R = \u03c1*(length)/(area) = \u03c1*(2L)/A.\n\nSecond wire: length L, area 2A. Resistance R = \u03c1*L/(2A).\n\nSo, R1 = 2\u03c1L/A, R2 = \u03c1L/(2A). Therefore, R1/R2 = (2\u03c1L/A)/(\u03c1L/(2A)) = (2/(1/2)) = 4. So, R1 is 4 times R2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, voltage division ratio is R1:R2 = 4:1. So, voltage across R1 is 4 parts, across R2 is 1 part. Total 5 parts = 7V. Therefore, each part is 7/5 V. So, voltage across R1 is 4*(7/5) = 28/5 = 5.6V, across R2 is 7/5 = 1.4V. So, junction is 8 - 5.6 = 2.4V. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for voltage between two resistors in series:\n\nV_junction = V_high - (V_high - V_low)*(R1)/(R1 + R2)\n\nWait, let's see. If the two resistors are between V_high and V_low, then the junction voltage is:\n\nV_junction = V_high - (V_high - V_low)*(R1)/(R1 + R2)\n\nBut in this case, V_high is 8V and V_low is 1V. So,\n\nV_junction = 8V - (8V - 1V)*(R1)/(R1 + R2) = 8V - 7V*(4R2)/(5R2) = 8V - 7V*(4/5) = 8V - (28/5)V = (40/5 - 28/5)V = 12/5 V = 2.4V. Same result.\n\nAlternatively, using the other formula:\n\nV_junction = V_low + (V_high - V_low)*(R2)/(R1 + R2) = 1V + 7V*(1/5) = 1V + 1.4V = 2.4V. Same answer.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the potential at the junction is 2.4 volts. So, 2.4V is the answer. The problem says \"most nearly equal to\", so if the options are integers, maybe 2V or 3V, but 2.4 is exactly 12/5, so maybe 2.4 is an option. Since the original potentials are 8.0 and 1.0, probably the answer is 2.4 volts. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Suppose I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recast the problem.\n\nSuppose we have two resistors in series: R1 = 4R and R2 = R, total resistance 5R. Total voltage across them is 7V. So, current I = 7V / 5R. Then, voltage across R1 is 4R * I = 4R*(7V/5R) = 28/5 V = 5.6V. Voltage across R2 is R*I = 7/5 V = 1.4V. So, yes, same as before. Therefore, the junction is at 8V - 5.6V = 2.4V.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of conductances. Since conductance G is inverse of resistance, G1 = 1/R1, G2 = 1/R2. But since they are in series, conductances don't add directly. So, maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, think of electric potential stepping down through the resistors. Starting at 8V, go through R1 which is four times R2, so most of the voltage drop is across R1. Then, stepping down to the junction, then stepping down the remaining across R2 to 1V. So, the junction is closer to the lower voltage, but since R1 is larger, the drop is more across R1, so the junction is closer to 1V? Wait, but 2.4V is between 1V and 8V, closer to 1V? 2.4 is 1.4 above 1, and 5.6 below 8. So, yes, since R1 is larger, more voltage is dropped across it, so the junction is closer to the lower end. So, 2.4V is 1.4V above 1V, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the resistances were equal, the junction would be at 4.5V, halfway between 1 and 8. But since R1 is four times R2, the voltage divides unequally, with more drop across R1. So, the junction is closer to 1V. So, 2.4V is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, after multiple checks, I think the answer is 2.4 volts. So, the potential at the junction is most nearly equal to 2.4 volts.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to \\boxed{2.4} volts."
