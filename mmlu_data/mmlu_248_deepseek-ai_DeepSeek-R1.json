        "question": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. The patient is a 44-year-old man with a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache that's worse in the morning. Ibuprofen helps a bit. No shortness of breath. His medical history is unremarkable, and he's only taking ibuprofen. Vital signs are slightly elevated temp (99.4\u00b0F), normal pulse and BP. Exam shows erythematous nasal mucosa, erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia in the throat, no cervical adenopathy, and clear lungs.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the common causes of sore throat, cough, runny nose, and headache. The differential could include viral upper respiratory infection (like the common cold), bacterial pharyngitis (like strep throat), sinusitis, maybe allergies, or something else.\n\nThe headache worse in the morning might be a clue. Morning headaches can be associated with sinusitis because lying down can cause fluid accumulation overnight, leading to increased pressure when waking up. But sinusitis usually lasts longer than 3 days; acute bacterial sinusitis typically presents after 10 days of symptoms. However, viral sinusitis can be shorter. But he also has a sore throat and cough, which are more common with upper respiratory infections.\n\nFollicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx\u2014that's like the bumps you see with viral infections. Strep throat (Group A Strep) usually presents with exudates, tender cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, absence of cough. But this patient doesn't have exudates mentioned, no cervical adenopathy, and he does have a cough and runny nose, which are more viral. So maybe viral pharyngitis.\n\nThe low-grade fever, clear lungs, no shortness of breath\u2014so probably not pneumonia. The lack of response to ibuprofen? Wait, the question says ibuprofen does provide some relief. So pain relief but maybe not addressing the underlying cause.\n\nThe frontal headache worse in the morning could also be due to postnasal drip from rhinitis causing sinus pressure. The erythematous nares suggest rhinitis, which is part of a common cold. So putting it all together: symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (cough, runny nose, sore throat), low-grade fever, no lymphadenopathy, follicular hyperplasia in the throat\u2014this points more towards a viral etiology, like rhinovirus or adenovirus.\n\nAnother possibility is influenza, but he doesn't mention body aches or high fever. Allergies could cause runny nose and sore throat, but they usually have itching, watery eyes, and the headache might not be as prominent. Also, follicular lymphoid hyperplasia is more common in infections.\n\nSo the most likely cause here is a viral upper respiratory infection, which is the common cold. The follicular lymphoid hyperplasia in the throat, along with other symptoms, supports that. Strep is less likely without exudate and lymphadenopathy. Sinusitis is possible but duration is short. So yeah, viral URI."
