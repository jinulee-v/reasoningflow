        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I bought an old pick-up truck for work. Scenario 2 | I looked up at the gorgeous waterfall and threw a rock at it.",
        "response": "Scenario 2 is the one where the main character does something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In this scenario, the character throws a rock at a waterfall, which is a natural and beautiful feature. This action can be considered disrespectful and potentially harmful to the environment. In contrast, buying an old pick-up truck for work in Scenario 1 is a normal and acceptable action that does not involve any moral wrongdoing."
