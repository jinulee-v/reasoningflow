        "question": "A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the angular magnification of a refracting telescope. The telescope has two converging lenses separated by 100 cm, and the eyepiece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. Hmm, let me recall what I know about telescopes.\n\nFirst, I remember that refracting telescopes use lenses to gather and focus light. There's the objective lens, which is the larger one that collects the light, and the eyepiece lens, which you look through. The angular magnification of the telescope depends on the focal lengths of these two lenses. Wait, the problem says both are converging lenses, which makes sense because refracting telescopes typically use converging lenses.\n\nThe formula for angular magnification in a telescope, when the image is formed at infinity (which is the case for normal adjustment, meaning the user's eyes are relaxed), is given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective lens to the focal length of the eyepiece lens. So, M = -f_o / f_e, where the negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. But since the problem just asks for angular magnification, maybe they just want the magnitude? I should check if the answer expects a negative sign or not. But let me confirm the formula.\n\nWait, another thing: the separation between the two lenses is given as 100 cm. In a telescope, the distance between the objective and the eyepiece should be equal to the sum of their focal lengths when the telescope is adjusted to view objects at infinity. So, if L is the separation, then L = f_o + f_e. Is that correct?\n\nYes, I think so. Because the objective lens forms an image at its focal point, and the eyepiece then needs to be positioned so that its focal point coincides with the image formed by the objective. Therefore, the distance between the lenses is indeed the sum of their focal lengths. So, if the separation is 100 cm, and the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm, then the focal length of the objective lens must be 100 cm - 20 cm = 80 cm. Wait, that seems right.\n\nSo, f_o = L - f_e = 100 cm - 20 cm = 80 cm. Then, the angular magnification M is f_o / f_e = 80 cm / 20 cm = 4. But wait, the formula I mentioned earlier had a negative sign. However, angular magnification is often given as a positive number when considering the magnitude, especially in simple cases. But maybe in optics, the negative sign is important because it indicates an inverted image. However, in astronomical telescopes, an inverted image isn't a big problem because there's no up or down in space, but sometimes people use erecting lenses to make the image upright. But since the problem doesn't mention anything about erecting lenses or the sign, maybe they just want the magnitude. Let me check the standard formula again.\n\nYes, the angular magnification M is given by the negative ratio of the focal lengths, M = -f_o / f_e, which gives both the magnitude and the inversion. But since the question asks for angular magnification, and typically in these problems unless specified, they might just want the magnitude. But I need to check the conventions. Wait, in many textbooks, the angular magnification is given as a positive number if the final image is upright, and negative if inverted. But in a refracting telescope with two converging lenses, the image is inverted. So, maybe the answer should be -4. But the problem says \"angular magnification,\" and sometimes they just want the absolute value. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again. It says, \"the angular magnification of the telescope is...\" and gives the options? Wait, no, actually, the user hasn't provided options. Wait, the original problem is just as stated: \"A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is...\" So, given that, I need to compute it. Since the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer without units, as it's given in centimeters but converted properly.\n\nWait, but first, let's recap:\n\n1. Telescope with two converging lenses: objective and eyepiece.\n2. Separation between lenses (distance between them) is 100 cm.\n3. Eyepiece focal length, f_e = 20 cm.\n4. Angular magnification M = -f_o / f_e.\n\nBut to find f_o, since the separation L = f_o + f_e (for a telescope focused at infinity), so f_o = L - f_e = 100 cm - 20 cm = 80 cm.\n\nTherefore, M = -80 cm / 20 cm = -4. But angular magnification can be reported as a positive number if considering absolute value, but in optics, the sign matters because it tells you about the orientation. However, in astronomy, sometimes the sign is ignored because orientation isn't critical. But since this is a physics problem, they might expect the negative sign.\n\nWait, but let me check another source. For example, the angular magnification of a telescope is given by M = f_o / f_e when the image is at infinity. But some sources say M = -f_o / f_e to indicate the inversion. So, if the problem is from a textbook that includes the sign, then -4 is the answer. If not, maybe 4. But given that the problem mentions \"angular magnification,\" which in the formula includes the negative sign for inversion, but sometimes in the context of telescopes, the magnification is given as a positive value with the understanding that the image is inverted. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. Angular magnification is defined as the ratio of the angular size of the image seen through the telescope to the angular size of the object as seen with the naked eye. Since the telescope inverts the image, the angle would be in the opposite direction, hence the negative sign. However, sometimes magnification is just quoted as a positive number because the main interest is the magnifying power, not the orientation. But in optics, the sign is part of the magnification. So, if the problem is from an optics course, they might expect -4. If it's a general physics course, maybe 4. But since the problem didn't specify, maybe I should go with the signed answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check the initial problem statement again. It says \"angular magnification of the telescope is\". Angular magnification, in general, can be signed depending on the orientation. For a simple two-lens telescope, the magnification is negative, indicating an inverted image. So, perhaps the answer is -4. But maybe the problem expects a positive answer. Wait, but in the formula, angular magnification is M = -f_o / f_e. So, if f_o is 80 cm, f_e is 20 cm, then M = -4. So, unless there's a different formula.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes, angular magnification is given as M = f_o / f_e, ignoring the sign, but strictly speaking, according to the derivation, it's negative. Let me recall the derivation.\n\nThe angular magnification is defined as M = \u03b8' / \u03b8, where \u03b8' is the angle subtended by the image at the eye, and \u03b8 is the angle subtended by the object at the unaided eye. For a telescope focused on infinity, the object is at infinity, so the angle \u03b8 is the angle subtended by the object at the objective lens. The telescope then forms an image at the focal plane, and the eyepiece is used to view this image. The angle \u03b8' is then the angle subtended by the image at the eyepiece. Since the eyepiece is a converging lens, the image is virtual and inverted. Therefore, \u03b8' is in the opposite direction to \u03b8, hence the negative sign. Therefore, M = -f_o / f_e.\n\nTherefore, the angular magnification is indeed -f_o / f_e, so in this case, -80/20 = -4. So, the answer should be -4. But maybe the problem expects a positive value? Hmm. Wait, let me check standard references.\n\nAccording to HyperPhysics: \"The magnification of a telescope is given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece.\" They state it as a positive value, but they might be ignoring the sign. Similarly, in some educational resources, they just present the magnitude. However, in more precise treatments, the sign is included to indicate inversion.\n\nGiven that the problem is about a refracting telescope with two converging lenses, the image formed is inverted, so the angular magnification should be negative. Therefore, the answer is -4. But let me check again.\n\nWait, the separation between the lenses is 100 cm. If the focal length of the eyepiece is 20 cm, then the focal length of the objective is 80 cm. So, M = -80/20 = -4. So, that's correct.\n\nBut maybe the problem is in a different configuration? Wait, no. In a refracting telescope, when adjusted for infinity, the separation is indeed the sum of the focal lengths. So, L = f_o + f_e. Therefore, f_o = L - f_e = 100 - 20 = 80 cm. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, angular magnification is -4. But maybe the answer is 4? Depending on the convention. Wait, let me check another source. For example, University Physics textbook by Young and Freedman: In chapter on optical instruments, they state that the angular magnification M of a telescope is given by M = -f1/f2, where f1 is the focal length of the objective and f2 is the focal length of the eyepiece. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted. So, according to that, the answer is -4.\n\nBut maybe the problem is from an educational context where they consider angular magnification as a positive number? Hmm. If the question is from an exam problem in a course that follows the convention where magnification is positive, then 4. But since the problem didn't specify, but in physics, typically, the sign is included. Therefore, I think the answer is -4.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial question again. The user wrote: \"The angular magnification of the telescope is\". The options weren't given. Wait, but the user hasn't provided options. Wait, hold on, the original problem is presented as a question expecting an answer boxed, so likely the answer is 4 or -4. But given that the problem is stated neutrally, perhaps expecting a positive answer. Wait, but angular magnification can be negative, but sometimes in the context of telescopes, the magnification is given as a positive number because the main interest is the magnifying power, not the image orientation. However, strictly speaking, according to the formula, it's negative. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the formula? Wait, let me think again. Angular magnification for a telescope is defined as M = \u03b8'/\u03b8, where \u03b8' is the angle subtended at the eye by the image, and \u03b8 is the angle subtended at the unaided eye by the object. For a distant object, the objective forms an image at its focal point, which is also the focal point of the eyepiece. The eyepiece then forms a virtual image at infinity. The angles relate to the ratio of the focal lengths. Since the telescope produces an inverted image, the angular magnification is negative. So, M = -f_o / f_e. Therefore, the answer is -4.\n\nBut maybe the problem is considering the magnifying power as an absolute value? If so, then 4. But I need to check common conventions. For example, in the Cambridge Physics textbook, they do include the negative sign. So, I think the correct answer is -4. However, in some contexts, especially in astronomy, the magnification is quoted as a positive number. But since this is a physics problem, likely expecting the signed answer. Therefore, I should go with -4.\n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose the two lenses are separated by 100 cm. The eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm. So, the objective focal length is 80 cm. Then, magnification is f_o / f_e = 80 / 20 = 4. But with a negative sign because it's inverted. So, -4. Therefore, the answer is -4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different? Wait, no. Angular magnification for a telescope is indeed given by the negative ratio of the objective focal length to the eyepiece focal length. So, M = -f_o / f_e. Therefore, -4.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose the objective has a longer focal length than the eyepiece. For instance, f_o = 100 cm, f_e = 5 cm. Then, M = -20. So, magnification of 20 times, inverted. So, yes, the negative sign is part of the formula.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, since f_o = 80 cm, f_e = 20 cm, M = -80 / 20 = -4.\n\nTherefore, the angular magnification is -4. But maybe the problem expects the answer in absolute terms? Hmm. Wait, but angular magnification is a signed quantity. If the problem is from a source that includes the sign, then -4 is correct. If not, maybe 4. But given that it's a physics problem, I think -4 is the accurate answer.\n\nBut let me check again. The problem says \"angular magnification\". In optics, angular magnification can be positive or negative, indicating the orientation. So, if the image is inverted, the angular magnification is negative. Therefore, the answer should be -4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the focal lengths? Wait, the problem says the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm. The separation is 100 cm. So, the objective focal length is 100 cm - 20 cm = 80 cm. So, yes, f_o = 80 cm. Therefore, M = -80 / 20 = -4.\n\nTherefore, I think confidently that the answer is -4. However, sometimes in amateur astronomy, the magnification is given as a positive number, but in physics, it's more precise to include the sign. Therefore, I will go with -4.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check with another approach. Suppose we have an object at infinity. The objective forms an image at its focal length, which is 80 cm from the objective. Then, the eyepiece is placed 20 cm from that image, because its focal length is 20 cm. Therefore, the separation between the lenses is 80 + 20 = 100 cm, which matches the problem statement. Then, the angular magnification is given by the ratio of the focal lengths, with a negative sign because the image is inverted. Therefore, M = -80/20 = -4. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the angular magnification is -4. So, unless the problem specifies that it wants the magnitude, the answer is -4. But given that the problem didn't specify, and in physics, we usually include the sign, so -4 is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check another resource. For example, according to the formula here: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geoopt/teles.html#c1\n\n\"The magnification is equal to the focal length of the objective divided by the focal length of the eyepiece.\" It says magnification is fo/fe. But in the diagram, it shows an inverted image, so perhaps they are omitting the sign. So, maybe in this context, they just want 4. Hmm. So, conflicting conventions.\n\nWait, but according to that HyperPhysics reference, they state the magnification as positive. But in reality, the image is inverted. So, perhaps in their treatment, they consider magnification as a positive value, ignoring the sign. So, maybe the answer is 4. But according to the formal definition in optics, angular magnification is negative for an inverted image.\n\nWait, let's check another source. From the textbook \"University Physics\" by Young and Freedman, 14th edition, page 1161, it says: \"The angular magnification M of a telescope is defined as the ratio of the angle subtended at the eye by the image to the angle subtended at the (unaided) eye by the object. The angular magnification is then the negative of the ratio of the focal length of the objective to that of the eyepiece: M = -f1/f2.\"\n\nTherefore, according to this textbook, the answer should be -4. So, given that, I think the answer is -4.\n\nBut maybe the problem is from a different source that uses a different convention? If so, but since the problem didn't specify, but given that in standard physics textbooks, the angular magnification includes the negative sign for refracting telescopes, I think -4 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, I will conclude that the angular magnification is -4. However, since sometimes in problems they might expect the magnitude, but given the derivation and standard formulas, I think -4 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular magnification of the telescope is \\boxed{-4}."
