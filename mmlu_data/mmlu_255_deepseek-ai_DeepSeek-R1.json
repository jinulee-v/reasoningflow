        "response": "Okay, so the user is asking what a PR person should do if they don't know the answer to a reporter's question. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that honesty is crucial in PR. If you don't know the answer, lying or making something up can backfire badly. So maybe the first step is to admit they don't know. But how exactly should they phrase that? You don't want to sound unprofessional or unprepared.\n\nNext, they should probably commit to finding the information. Maybe say they'll look into it and get back to the reporter. But they need to set a clear timeframe, like promising to follow up by the end of the day. That shows responsibility and reliability.\n\nAlso, offering alternative information might help. If there's a related fact they do know, sharing that could be useful. For example, \"While I don't have those specific numbers, I can tell you about our recent initiatives...\" That keeps the conversation productive.\n\nThey should avoid speculating or guessing. Providing incorrect information is worse than not answering. So emphasizing the importance of accuracy is key here.\n\nMaybe there's something about redirecting to the right person if the question is outside their expertise. Suggesting another spokesperson or department head could be appropriate. But they should coordinate that introduction rather than just passing the buck.\n\nDocumentation is important too. After the interaction, they should note the question and follow up internally to get the answer. Then, make sure to actually get back to the reporter as promised. Missing the follow-up could damage credibility.\n\nPreparation is part of prevention. If there are recurring questions they don't know, they should update their FAQs or briefing documents. Training sessions might help too, so they're better prepared next time.\n\nTransparency builds trust. Even if they can't answer, being upfront maintains credibility. Reporters appreciate honesty over evasion.\n\nIn some cases, if the information is confidential, they might have to say they can't disclose it. But they should explain why, if possible, instead of just refusing.\n\nPutting this all together, the PR person should: admit they don't know, commit to finding the answer with a timeframe, offer related info if possible, avoid guessing, redirect if needed, document the question, follow up promptly, prepare better for next time, and maintain transparency.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Maybe examples of phrases to use. Like, \"That's a great question. Let me get the most accurate information for you and follow up by this afternoon.\" Something like that. Also, ensuring that when they redirect, they don't leave the reporter hanging but facilitate the connection.\n\nOh, and after following up, maybe confirm with the reporter if they need anything else. Keeping the relationship positive for future interactions."
