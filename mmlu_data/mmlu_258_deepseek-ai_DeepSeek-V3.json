        "question": "At which stage in the planning process would a situation analysis be carried out?",
        "response": "A situation analysis is typically carried out during the **initial stage** of the planning process. This stage is often referred to as the **\"situational assessment\"** or **\"environmental scanning\"** phase. The purpose of a situation analysis is to gather and analyze relevant information about the current internal and external environment of the organization or project. This includes assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis), understanding market conditions, evaluating resources, and identifying key stakeholders.\n\nBy conducting a situation analysis, planners can gain a clear understanding of the context in which they are operating, which helps in setting realistic goals, identifying potential challenges, and making informed decisions throughout the planning process. This foundational step ensures that subsequent stages of planning, such as strategy formulation and implementation, are based on accurate and comprehensive information."
