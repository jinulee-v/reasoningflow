        "question": "A 0.217 g sample of HgO (molar mass = 217 g) reacts with excess iodide ions according to the reaction shown above. Titration of the resulting solution requires how many mL of 0.10 M HCl to reach equivalence point?",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. It says a 0.217 g sample of HgO (with a molar mass of 217 g) reacts with excess iodide ions according to the reaction shown above. Then, the titration of the resulting solution requires how many mL of 0.10 M HCl to reach the equivalence point. Hmm, wait, the problem mentions a reaction with iodide ions, but it doesn't write out the actual chemical equation. That might be a problem. Maybe I need to figure out the reaction first?\n\nAlright, let me think. Mercury(II) oxide reacting with iodide ions. Mercury is in the +2 oxidation state in HgO. Iodide is I\u207b. So maybe this is a redox reaction? Because iodide is a reducing agent, and HgO might be an oxidizing agent. Let me recall the possible reactions. \n\nIn acidic conditions, HgO can act as an oxidizing agent. The reaction might involve HgO oxidizing iodide ions to iodine, while itself being reduced. Let me try writing the half-reactions. \n\nFirst, the oxidation half-reaction: I\u207b \u2192 I\u2082. To balance that, each I\u207b loses an electron. Since I\u2082 is I\u2082, each iodide ion loses one electron. So for two iodide ions, that's 2 electrons lost. So the oxidation half-reaction would be 2 I\u207b \u2192 I\u2082 + 2 e\u207b.\n\nNow the reduction half-reaction. HgO is going to be reduced. Hg is in +2 oxidation state in HgO. If it's reduced, it would go to a lower oxidation state. Mercury can form Hg\u00b2\u207a, but maybe in this case, since it's reacting with iodide, perhaps it forms HgI\u2082? Wait, but HgI\u2082 is a possible compound. Alternatively, maybe Hg metal? Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, in acidic solution, HgO might be reduced to Hg\u00b2+? Let me see. Let's consider the reduction of HgO. The Hg in HgO is +2. If it's reduced, it would go to a lower oxidation state. But Hg can go to 0 (metal) or maybe +1? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe HgO is acting as an oxidizing agent, so it's being reduced. Let me try writing the reduction half-reaction.\n\nHgO \u2192 Hg\u00b2+? Let's see. HgO in acidic solution would dissociate into Hg\u00b2+ and O\u00b2\u207b, but in acidic conditions, the O\u00b2\u207b would react with H+ to form water. So maybe the reduction is HgO + H+ + e\u207b \u2192 Hg\u00b2+ + H2O? Wait, let me balance it properly.\n\nLet me try balancing the reduction half-reaction. Let's assume it's in acidic solution. The HgO is being reduced. Let's write the skeleton:\n\nHgO \u2192 Hg\u00b2+ \n\nOxygen is in HgO as O\u00b2\u207b. To balance oxygen, we can add H2O. Let's see:\n\nHgO \u2192 Hg\u00b2+ + O\u00b2\u207b \n\nBut in acidic solution, O\u00b2\u207b would combine with H+ to form H2O. Alternatively, maybe:\n\nHgO + H+ \u2192 Hg\u00b2+ + H2O \n\nLet me balance the atoms. On the left, we have Hg, O, and H+. On the right, Hg\u00b2+, H2O. \n\nHg is balanced (1 on each side). O: 1 on left, 1 on right (in H2O). H: on the left, we have H+; on the right, 2 H in H2O. So to balance H, we need 2 H+ on the left:\n\nHgO + 2 H+ \u2192 Hg\u00b2+ + H2O \n\nNow check charges. Left side: HgO is neutral, 2 H+ gives +2. Total charge is +2. Right side: Hg\u00b2+ is +2, H2O is neutral. So charge is +2 on both sides. So that's balanced. So the reduction half-reaction is HgO + 2 H+ + 2 e\u207b \u2192 Hg\u00b2+ + H2O. Wait, but where did the electrons come from? Since it's a reduction, electrons are gained. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the reduction, the Hg is going from +2 in HgO to +2 in Hg\u00b2+? Wait, that's the same oxidation state. That can't be right. Wait, that's a problem. If Hg is staying at +2, then that's not a reduction. Hmm, so maybe my assumption is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps HgO is being reduced to Hg metal? Let's try that. Then Hg would go from +2 to 0. Let's try that half-reaction.\n\nHgO \u2192 Hg \n\nOxygen is in HgO, so we need to balance O. Let's add H2O and H+.\n\nHgO \u2192 Hg + O\u00b2\u207b \n\nBut in acidic solution, O\u00b2\u207b would combine with H+ to form H2O. Alternatively:\n\nHgO \u2192 Hg + H2O \n\nBut then balancing H and O:\n\nLeft side: 1 O in HgO. Right side: 1 O in H2O. So O is balanced. H: on the right, 2 H in H2O. So need 2 H+ on the left:\n\nHgO + 2 H+ \u2192 Hg + H2O \n\nNow check charges. Left side: HgO is neutral, 2 H+ gives +2. Right side: Hg is 0, H2O is neutral. So charge on left is +2, right is 0. To balance charge, we need to add electrons to the left side (since reduction is gain of electrons). Wait, but reduction is gain of electrons, so the electrons should be on the left. Wait, the left side is more positive, so to get to 0, we need to add 2 electrons to the left side:\n\nHgO + 2 H+ + 2 e\u207b \u2192 Hg + H2O \n\nNow check charge: left side: 2 H+ gives +2, plus 2 e\u207b gives 0. Right side is 0. So that works. So the reduction half-reaction is HgO + 2 H+ + 2 e\u207b \u2192 Hg + H2O. \n\nSo the Hg is being reduced from +2 to 0, gaining 2 electrons per HgO molecule. \n\nNow the oxidation half-reaction is the iodide ions being oxidized to I2. Let's write that again:\n\n2 I\u207b \u2192 I\u2082 + 2 e\u207b \n\nSo each I\u207b loses an electron, so two I\u207b lose 2 electrons to form I\u2082. \n\nNow, to combine the two half-reactions, we need to make sure the electrons cancel out. The reduction half-reaction has 2 electrons on the left (gained), and the oxidation has 2 electrons on the right (lost). So if we add them together, the electrons will cancel. \n\nSo combining:\n\nHgO + 2 H+ + 2 e\u207b \u2192 Hg + H2O \n\n2 I\u207b \u2192 I\u2082 + 2 e\u207b \n\nAdding them together:\n\nHgO + 2 H+ + 2 I\u207b \u2192 Hg + H2O + I\u2082 \n\nSo the overall reaction is HgO + 2 H+ + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082? Wait, no, the products are Hg, H2O, and I\u2082. Wait, but Hg and I\u2082? Hmm, maybe it's HgI\u2082? Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the Hg and I\u2082 are in solution? Wait, Hg is a metal, so maybe it precipitates? But the problem mentions the resulting solution, so maybe the Hg is in solution as Hg\u00b2+? Wait, but in the reduction half-reaction, Hg is going to 0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Hg is forming a complex with iodide? Let me think again. Maybe the reaction is different. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe HgO reacts with iodide in acidic solution to form HgI\u2082 and water? Let me see. Let me try writing the equation again. \n\nHgO + I\u207b \u2192 ?\n\nIf HgO is reacting with iodide, perhaps in acidic solution, the HgO is acting as an oxidizing agent. Let me think of another possible product. Mercury(II) iodide is HgI\u2082, which is a white solid. Alternatively, maybe HgI\u2084\u00b2\u207b in solution? Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b + H2O \u2192 HgI\u2082 + 2 OH\u207b? But that would be in basic solution. Wait, but the problem mentions titration with HCl, which is acidic. Maybe the reaction is in acidic conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b + 2 H+ \u2192 HgI\u2082 + H2O. Let me check the oxidation states here. Hg in HgO is +2. In HgI\u2082, Hg is +2 (since each I\u207b is -1, so 2*(-1) = -2, so Hg must be +2). So that doesn't involve a redox reaction. Hmm, so that can't be right because then there's no electron transfer. \n\nHmm, so maybe my initial approach was correct with the redox reaction. Let me go back. \n\nThe balanced equation from the half-reactions is HgO + 2 H+ + 2 I\u207b \u2192 Hg + H2O + I\u2082. But Hg is a metal, so maybe it precipitates out? The problem says the resulting solution is titrated with HCl. If Hg is a solid, then it might not be in solution. But the problem mentions the \"resulting solution\", so perhaps the Hg is actually in solution as Hg\u00b2+? Wait, but in the reduction half-reaction, Hg is going to 0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the reduction half-reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe HgO is being reduced to Hg\u00b2+? Wait, but that would mean no change in oxidation state. That can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is different. Let me think again. Maybe HgO is reacting with iodide in acidic solution to form HgI\u2082 and water. Let me try balancing that equation. \n\nHgO + I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + H2O \n\nLet me balance the atoms. \n\nHg: 1 on left, 1 on right. \n\nO: 1 on left, 1 on right (in H2O). \n\nI: 2 on right, so need 2 I\u207b on left. \n\nH: 2 on right (in H2O), so need 2 H+ on left. \n\nSo equation becomes:\n\nHgO + 2 I\u207b + 2 H+ \u2192 HgI\u2082 + H2O \n\nNow check oxidation states. Hg in HgO is +2. In HgI\u2082, Hg is +2. So no change. So that's not a redox reaction. Hmm, so that can't be right. \n\nHmm, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b? But then O\u00b2\u207b would react with H+ in acidic solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and then O\u00b2\u207b combines with H+ to form H2O and O2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O2? But that would require oxygen to be oxidized. Let me see. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that HgO is acting as an oxidizing agent, so the oxygen is being reduced? Wait, oxygen in HgO is -2. If it's reduced, it would go to a lower oxidation state? But oxygen usually is oxidized to O2 (0 oxidation state) or something else. Wait, maybe in this case, the oxygen is staying at -2? \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look up the standard reaction between HgO and iodide ions. Wait, but since this is a problem given to me, maybe I need to figure it out based on stoichiometry and the titration with HCl. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to know that HgO reacts with iodide to form HgI\u2082 and water, and then the H+ from HCl is neutralizing something else? Wait, but the problem says \"reacts with excess iodide ions\", so maybe the HgO is completely consumed, and the product is HgI\u2082, which is a neutral compound? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction produces HgI\u2082 and water, and the solution has some H+ or OH- that needs to be titrated with HCl. Wait, but HCl is an acid, so if the solution is basic, you would titrate with HCl. But if the solution is acidic, you would titrate with a base. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction between HgO and iodide produces a basic solution, which is then titrated with HCl. Let me think. \n\nWait, HgO is a metal oxide, which is basic. So when it reacts with water, it would produce Hg(OH)\u2082, which is a base. But if it's reacting with iodide ions, maybe it's in acidic solution? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and then O\u00b2\u207b reacts with water to form OH\u207b, making the solution basic. Then, the OH\u207b would be titrated with HCl. \n\nLet me try that approach. \n\nSuppose the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b \n\nThen, O\u00b2\u207b in solution would react with water: \n\nO\u00b2\u207b + H2O \u2192 2 OH\u207b \n\nSo overall, the reaction would be: \n\nHgO + 2 I\u207b + H2O \u2192 HgI\u2082 + 2 OH\u207b \n\nSo the products are HgI\u2082 and OH\u207b. The OH\u207b would make the solution basic, so when titrated with HCl (a strong acid), the OH\u207b would react with H+ from HCl. \n\nSo the titration reaction would be: \n\nOH\u207b + H+ \u2192 H2O \n\nTherefore, the moles of HCl needed would be equal to the moles of OH\u207b produced. \n\nSo let's see. \n\nFirst, find moles of HgO. The mass is 0.217 g, molar mass 217 g/mol. \n\nMoles HgO = 0.217 g / 217 g/mol = 0.001 mol. \n\nFrom the reaction above, each mole of HgO produces 2 moles of OH\u207b. \n\nSo moles OH\u207b = 0.001 mol HgO * 2 = 0.002 mol OH\u207b. \n\nThen, since HCl reacts 1:1 with OH\u207b, moles HCl needed = 0.002 mol. \n\nThe concentration of HCl is 0.10 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.002 / 0.10 = 0.02 L = 20 mL. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but I need to check if my assumed reaction is correct. \n\nWait, but in the reaction I wrote, HgO + 2 I\u207b + H2O \u2192 HgI\u2082 + 2 OH\u207b, the iodide is in excess, so that's okay. The problem states that iodide is in excess, so HgO is the limiting reagent. \n\nBut let me verify the stoichiometry again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is different. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and then O\u00b2\u207b is in solution. But O\u00b2\u207b is a strong base, so it would react with water to form OH\u207b. \n\nSo the overall reaction would indeed produce 2 OH\u207b per HgO. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and then O\u00b2\u207b is in solution. But in solution, O\u00b2\u207b would hydrolyze: \n\nO\u00b2\u207b + H2O \u2192 2 OH\u207b \n\nSo that gives 2 OH\u207b per HgO. \n\nTherefore, the total OH\u207b is 2 * moles of HgO. \n\nSo that seems okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and then O\u00b2\u207b is just left as is, but in solution, it would react with water. \n\nTherefore, the OH\u207b concentration would be 2 * moles HgO. \n\nTherefore, the calculation would be as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is different. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is HgO reacting with iodide in acidic solution to form HgI\u2082 and water, but without producing OH\u207b. Let me see. \n\nSuppose the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b + 2 H+ \u2192 HgI\u2082 + H2O \n\nIn this case, there's no OH\u207b produced. The H+ comes from the acid, so maybe the solution is neutral? But then why titrate with HCl? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the HgO is reacting with iodide in a way that produces H+ which then needs to be titrated with HCl? Wait, but HCl is an acid, so if the solution is acidic, you would titrate with a base. \n\nHmm, perhaps my first approach is correct. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe problem states that HgO reacts with excess iodide ions. The product is then titrated with HCl. The question is how much HCl is needed. \n\nPerhaps the HgO is reacting with iodide to form a compound that releases hydroxide ions, which are then titrated with HCl. \n\nAlternatively, maybe HgO is a basic oxide, so when it reacts with water, it forms a base, which is then titrated with HCl. \n\nWait, HgO is a metal oxide, so it would react with water to form a metal hydroxide. \n\nHgO + H2O \u2192 Hg(OH)\u2082 \n\nHg(OH)\u2082 is a base, so it would react with HCl: \n\nHg(OH)\u2082 + 2 HCl \u2192 HgCl\u2082 + 2 H2O \n\nSo in this case, the moles of HCl needed would be 2 * moles of Hg(OH)\u2082, which is 2 * moles of HgO. \n\nSo moles HgO = 0.217 g / 217 g/mol = 0.001 mol \n\nMoles HCl = 2 * 0.001 = 0.002 mol \n\nVolume = 0.002 / 0.10 = 0.02 L = 20 mL \n\nSame answer as before. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"reacts with excess iodide ions\". So maybe the reaction isn't just with water, but with iodide. \n\nHmm, so if the reaction is with iodide, then perhaps the Hg(OH)\u2082 reacts with iodide to form HgI\u2082 and water? \n\nHg(OH)\u2082 + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + 2 OH\u207b \n\nThen the OH\u207b is titrated with HCl. \n\nSo again, the OH\u207b comes from the reaction, and the moles of OH\u207b would be 2 * moles HgO. \n\nSo same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the HgO reacts directly with iodide in solution to form HgI\u2082 and hydroxide ions. \n\nHgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b \n\nThen O\u00b2\u207b reacts with water to form 2 OH\u207b, so again 2 moles of OH\u207b per HgO. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the pathway, the moles of OH\u207b produced are 2 * moles HgO. \n\nTherefore, the volume of HCl needed is 20 mL. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"reacts with excess iodide ions according to the reaction shown above\". Wait, the user mentioned \"the reaction shown above\", but in the problem presented here, there is no reaction shown. Maybe in the original problem, there was a reaction given, but it's missing here. \n\nHmm, that complicates things. Since the user hasn't provided the reaction, maybe I need to assume a standard reaction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and then O\u00b2\u207b is in solution. But O\u00b2\u207b is a strong base, so it would react with water to form OH\u207b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and then O\u00b2\u207b is neutralized by H+ from HCl. \n\nWait, but HCl is an acid, so if O\u00b2\u207b is present, it would react with H+ to form OH\u207b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the HgO is reacting with iodide in acidic solution, so the H+ is already present. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me think of another angle. \n\nThe key is that the HgO is reacting with iodide, and the product is something that can be titrated with HCl. Since HCl is an acid, the titration is likely to neutralize a base produced in the reaction. \n\nTherefore, the reaction between HgO and iodide must produce a base, which is then titrated with HCl. \n\nHgO is a basic oxide, so when it reacts with water, it forms a base (Hg(OH)\u2082). If the iodide is in solution, perhaps the Hg(OH)\u2082 reacts with iodide to form HgI\u2082 and water, but the hydroxide ions remain? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and O\u00b2\u207b is a strong base, so it would react with water to form OH\u207b. \n\nTherefore, the OH\u207b concentration is 2 * moles of HgO. \n\nTherefore, the moles of HCl needed would be equal to moles of OH\u207b, which is 2 * moles HgO. \n\nCalculations: \n\nMolar mass HgO is 217 g/mol, so 0.217 g / 217 g/mol = 0.001 mol HgO. \n\nMoles OH\u207b = 2 * 0.001 = 0.002 mol. \n\nVolume HCl = 0.002 mol / 0.10 mol/L = 0.02 L = 20 mL. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 mL. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is different. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b, and then O\u00b2\u207b is in solution. Since O\u00b2\u207b is a strong base, it would react with water: \n\nO\u00b2\u207b + H2O \u2192 2 OH\u207b \n\nSo each mole of O\u00b2\u207b gives 2 moles of OH\u207b. Since each mole of HgO gives 1 mole of O\u00b2\u207b, then total OH\u207b is 2 * moles HgO. \n\nTherefore, same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b + H2O \u2192 HgI\u2082 + 2 OH\u207b, so directly producing 2 OH\u207b per HgO. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that HgO is an acid anhydride, so reacting with iodide in water to form HgI\u2082 and H2O, but without producing OH\u207b. \n\nWait, but then why titrate with HCl? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HgO is reacting with iodide in acidic solution, so the H+ is already present, and the reaction consumes H+ which then needs to be titrated? \n\nWait, but HCl is the titrant, so if the solution is acidic, you would titrate with a base. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction produces H+ which is then titrated with HCl? That doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider that the reaction between HgO and iodide produces a neutral compound, but the solution has excess iodide, which is a weak acid? \n\nWait, iodide is a conjugate base of HI, which is a strong acid, so iodide is a very weak base. So it wouldn't produce OH\u207b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction produces HgI\u2082 and water, but the solution is neutral, so no titration needed? That can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the HgO is reacting with iodide in a redox reaction where Hg is reduced to Hg\u00b2+ and I\u207b is oxidized to I2. \n\nWait, let me try that again. \n\nSuppose the reaction is a redox reaction where HgO is reduced to Hg\u00b2+ and I\u207b is oxidized to I2. \n\nThe reduction half-reaction would be HgO \u2192 Hg\u00b2+ \n\nBut Hg is already +2 in HgO, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, HgO is reduced to Hg. \n\nHgO \u2192 Hg \n\nWhich requires gaining 2 electrons. \n\nThe oxidation half-reaction is 2 I\u207b \u2192 I\u2082 + 2 e\u207b \n\nSo combining, the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 Hg + I\u2082 \n\nBut then, where are the H+ and H2O? \n\nIn acidic solution, the reduction half-reaction would be: \n\nHgO + 2 H+ + 2 e\u207b \u2192 Hg + H2O \n\nOxidation: 2 I\u207b \u2192 I\u2082 + 2 e\u207b \n\nTotal reaction: HgO + 2 H+ + 2 I\u207b \u2192 Hg + H2O + I\u2082 \n\nIn this case, the H+ comes from the acid, so if the solution is acidic, then the H+ is already present. \n\nBut the problem mentions titration with HCl. If the H+ is already present, then maybe the solution is acidic, so you wouldn't titrate with HCl. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reaction consumes H+ which then needs to be titrated? \n\nWait, in the reaction above, H+ is a reactant. So if the reaction consumes H+, then the solution would become less acidic, and you might need to add HCl to restore the H+? \n\nWait, but the problem states that the reaction is with excess iodide ions. So maybe the HgO is the limiting reagent. \n\nThe moles of HgO is 0.001 mol. \n\nThe reaction consumes 2 moles of H+ per mole of HgO. \n\nSo total H+ consumed is 0.002 mol. \n\nTherefore, to neutralize that, you would need 0.002 mol of OH\u207b, but since we are using HCl, which provides H+, perhaps the titration is to neutralize the excess H+? Wait, this is getting confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution after reaction has some OH\u207b from the reaction, which is then titrated with HCl. \n\nWait, in the reaction HgO + 2 H+ + 2 I\u207b \u2192 Hg + H2O + I\u2082, the H+ is consumed. So if the solution was initially acidic, after the reaction, the H+ concentration would decrease. To find the equivalence point, perhaps the titration is to determine the amount of H+ consumed? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that HgO is a basic oxide, so when it reacts with water, it forms Hg(OH)\u2082, which is a base. The base is then titrated with HCl. \n\nHg(OH)\u2082 + 2 HCl \u2192 HgCl\u2082 + 2 H2O \n\nSo moles HCl = 2 * moles HgO = 0.002 mol, so volume is 20 mL. \n\nThis seems plausible and straightforward. \n\nGiven that the problem mentions reacting with excess iodide ions, perhaps the HgO is first reacting with water to form Hg(OH)\u2082, which then reacts with iodide? But if iodide is in excess, maybe it's just forming HgI\u2082, but the Hg(OH)\u2082 would still have released OH\u207b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of iodide doesn't affect the basicity, so the HgO still produces OH\u207b which is titrated. \n\nSince the problem states that iodide is in excess, the HgO is completely consumed, so the amount of OH\u207b produced is based on the HgO. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the exact reaction pathway, the key is that each mole of HgO produces 2 moles of OH\u207b, leading to 20 mL of 0.10 M HCl. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is different. Let me think of another possibility. \n\nSuppose HgO reacts with iodide in acidic solution to form HgI\u2082 and water, but the reaction requires H+ which is then titrated. \n\nWait, if the reaction consumes H+, then the solution would be less acidic, so you would titrate with HCl to find the amount of H+ consumed? \n\nWait, but the problem says \"titration of the resulting solution requires how many mL of 0.10 M HCl to reach equivalence point\". \n\nIf the reaction consumed H+, then the solution would be less acidic, so you would need to add HCl to get back to neutral? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction produces OH\u207b, so you need to add HCl to neutralize it. \n\nGiven that HgO is a basic oxide, I think the most straightforward approach is that HgO reacts with water to form Hg(OH)\u2082, which is a base, and then titrated with HCl. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 20 mL. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with another method. \n\nSuppose the reaction is HgO + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + O\u00b2\u207b \n\nThen O\u00b2\u207b is a strong base, so it reacts with water: \n\nO\u00b2\u207b + H2O \u2192 2 OH\u207b \n\nThus, moles of OH\u207b = 2 * moles of O\u00b2\u207b = 2 * moles of HgO = 0.002 mol \n\nThen, moles HCl needed = 0.002 mol \n\nVolume = 0.002 / 0.10 = 0.02 L = 20 mL \n\nSame answer. \n\nAlternatively, if the reaction is HgO + 2 H+ + 2 I\u207b \u2192 HgI\u2082 + H2O \n\nThen, the H+ is consumed. Suppose initially, the solution has some H+ from HCl, but since HgO is reacting with H+, the moles of H+ consumed would be 2 * moles HgO. \n\nTherefore, to find the equivalence point, you need to add HCl to replace the consumed H+? \n\nWait, but equivalence point in titration usually refers to neutralizing a base with an acid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution after reaction has excess OH\u207b, so you titrate with HCl to neutralize it. \n\nGiven that all paths lead to 20 mL, I think that's the answer. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 20 mL, so 20.0 mL, which would be written as 20 mL. \n\nWait, but let me check the molar mass again. The problem states molar mass of HgO is 217 g. \n\n0.217 g / 217 g/mol = 0.001 mol. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo 0.001 mol HgO * 2 = 0.002 mol OH\u207b \n\n0.002 mol / 0.10 M = 0.02 L = 20 mL. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 20 mL. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe volume of 0.10 M HCl required is \\boxed{20} mL.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the volume of 0.10 M HCl required to reach the equivalence point when titrating the resulting solution from the reaction of 0.217 g of HgO with excess iodide ions, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate moles of HgO:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Molar mass of HgO} = 217 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Moles of HgO} = \\frac{0.217 \\, \\text{g}}{217 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 0.001 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the reaction and stoichiometry:**\n   HgO is a basic oxide and reacts with water to form Hg(OH)\u2082, a base:\n   \\[\n   \\text{HgO} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{Hg(OH)}_2\n   \\]\n   Hg(OH)\u2082 is a strong base and will react with HCl in a neutralization reaction:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hg(OH)}_2 + 2 \\, \\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{HgCl}_2 + 2 \\, \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate moles of HCl required:**\n   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Hg(OH)\u2082 reacts with 2 moles of HCl. Therefore, moles of HCl needed are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Moles of HCl} = 2 \\times \\text{moles of HgO} = 2 \\times 0.001 \\, \\text{mol} = 0.002 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate volume of HCl solution:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume of HCl} = \\frac{\\text{Moles of HCl}}{\\text{Molarity of HCl}} = \\frac{0.002 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.10 \\, \\text{mol/L}} = 0.02 \\, \\text{L} = 20 \\, \\text{mL}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume of 0.10 M HCl required to reach the equivalence point is \\boxed{20} mL."
