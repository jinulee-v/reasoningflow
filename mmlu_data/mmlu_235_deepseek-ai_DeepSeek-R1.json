        "question": "Box a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization had the following transactions during the year: Proceeds from sale of investments $80000 Purchase of property plant and equipment $10000 Proceeds from long-term debt $100000 Loss on sale of investment $5000 What amount should be reported as net cash provided by financing activities in Box's statement of cash flows?",
        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about determining the net cash provided by financing activities for a nongovernmental not-for-profit organization named Box. The transactions given are proceeds from the sale of investments, purchase of property plant and equipment, proceeds from long-term debt, and a loss on the sale of investment. We need to figure out which of these transactions affect the financing activities section of the cash flow statement.\n\nFirst, I remember that the statement of cash flows is divided into three main sections: operating, investing, and financing activities. Each section captures different types of cash inflows and outflows. Let me recall what each section typically includes.\n\nOperating activities are related to the day-to-day business operations\u2014like cash received from services or cash paid for expenses. Investing activities involve the purchase and sale of long-term assets like property, plant, and equipment, as well as investments. Financing activities are transactions related to the organization's long-term liabilities and equity, such as issuing debt, repaying debt, or contributions restricted for long-term purposes.\n\nNow, looking at the transactions provided:\n\n1. Proceeds from sale of investments: $80,000.\n2. Purchase of property, plant, and equipment: $10,000.\n3. Proceeds from long-term debt: $100,000.\n4. Loss on sale of investment: $5,000.\n\nLet me categorize each transaction.\n\nStarting with the first one: Proceeds from sale of investments. Since investments are typically considered investing activities, the sale would fall under investing. So that's an inflow in the investing section. So this is $80,000 inflow in investing activities.\n\nSecond transaction: Purchase of property, plant, and equipment. Purchasing fixed assets is a classic investing activity. So this is a $10,000 outflow in investing.\n\nThird: Proceeds from long-term debt. Issuing long-term debt is a financing activity. So this would be a $100,000 inflow in financing.\n\nFourth: Loss on sale of investment. Hmm, this is a non-cash item. The loss itself doesn't involve cash; it's part of the income statement. However, when preparing the cash flow statement using the indirect method, the loss would be added back to net income in the operating activities section because it's a non-cash expense. But since we're dealing with the direct method here (since we're given specific cash transactions), maybe this loss isn't directly affecting any cash flow section. Wait, but the proceeds from the sale of investments would have been part of investing activities. The loss would affect the operating activities if using the indirect method, but since we're looking at cash flows directly, maybe this loss is just part of the calculation for the proceeds. Let me think. When you sell an investment, the cash received is the proceeds, which is the selling price. The loss is the difference between the book value and the selling price. So, for example, if the book value was $85,000 and sold for $80,000, the loss is $5,000. But the cash inflow is still $80,000. So the loss itself doesn't directly impact cash flows; it's already accounted for in the proceeds. Therefore, the loss on sale of investment is a non-cash adjustment that would be handled in the operating activities if using the indirect method, but since we're looking at cash flows from financing activities, this $5,000 loss doesn't affect financing. So maybe this transaction isn't relevant for the financing section.\n\nSo, focusing on financing activities: proceeds from long-term debt is the only one here. The other transactions are either investing or operating. So the net cash provided by financing activities would be $100,000 from the proceeds of long-term debt. The other transactions (sale of investments and purchase of PPE) are investing activities, and the loss is part of operating adjustments but doesn't involve cash. Therefore, the answer should be $100,000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, non-profit organizations might have different classifications, but I don't think so. Generally, financing activities for non-profits would include contributions restricted for long-term purposes, proceeds from loans, repayment of loans, etc. So proceeds from long-term debt (like a bank loan) would definitely be financing. The sale of investments is an investing activity because it's the sale of a long-term asset. Purchase of PPE is also investing. The loss on sale is non-cash, so operating adjustment. Therefore, the financing activities only include the $100,000 proceeds from long-term debt. So the answer is $100,000.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"net cash provided by financing activities.\" So we need to make sure there are no other financing cash outflows. The problem only lists one financing activity: proceeds from long-term debt. The other transactions are investing. So net cash provided by financing is $100,000. Therefore, the answer should be $100,000."
