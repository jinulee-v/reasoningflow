        "question": "_____________ can modify data on your system \u2013 so that your system doesn\u2019t run correctly or you can no longer access specific data, or it may even ask for ransom in order to give your access.",
        "response": "**Malware** can modify data on your system \u2013 so that your system doesn\u2019t run correctly or you can no longer access specific data, or it may even ask for ransom in order to give you access. \n\nSpecifically, **ransomware** is a type of malware that encrypts your files or locks your system, demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for restoring access. Other types of malware, such as viruses, worms, or trojans, can also corrupt or delete data, disrupt system functionality, or steal sensitive information. It's crucial to use antivirus software, keep your system updated, and practice safe browsing habits to protect against such threats."
