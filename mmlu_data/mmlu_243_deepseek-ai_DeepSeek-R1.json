        "question": "On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely",
        "response": "Okay, let's try to work through this legal problem step by step. So, the question is about whether the teacher can get a mandatory injunction to force the librarian to remove a fence that's been built in a restricted area. Let me start by recalling the facts and then break down the legal issues involved.\n\nFirst, the developer in 1980 created a general development plan with certain restrictions. These restrictions were recorded and apply to all lots in the residential district. The key restrictions here are (22) creating a franchise right for public utilities in a 10-foot strip along the rear of each lot, and (23) prohibiting any structures on that strip. The retiree built a fence in this area in 2000, then the teacher bought a lot in 2004, and the librarian bought the adjacent lot in 2006. All their deeds reference the recorded plan. In 2008, the librarian built a fence along the boundary with the teacher's lot and through the center of the restricted strip. The teacher objects and wants the fence removed.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the librarian's fence violates the restrictive covenants, and if so, whether the teacher can enforce those covenants to get an injunction. Let's unpack this.\n\nFirst, we need to determine if the restrictions are enforceable against the librarian. Since the original developer recorded the plan, and each subsequent deed references the recorded restrictions, that suggests that the restrictions are covenants running with the land. For a covenant to run with the land, certain requirements must be met: intent, touch and concern the land, horizontal privity (for real covenants), and vertical privity. However, in many jurisdictions, especially for equitable servitudes, the key is whether the covenant was intended to bind successors and whether the subsequent purchasers had notice. Here, the plan was recorded, and the deeds referenced the recorded plan, so the librarian had constructive notice. Therefore, the restrictions should be enforceable against the librarian as equitable servitudes.\n\nNext, we need to look at the specific restrictions. Restriction (23) says no house or structure of any kind can be built on the 10-foot strip. The librarian built a fence in that strip. A fence is a structure, so on its face, this seems to violate restriction (23). But wait, the retiree also built a fence in 2000 within the restricted area. Does that affect anything? Maybe the retiree's fence was a prior violation, but the teacher is not complaining about that. The issue here is the librarian's fence. Even if others have violated the covenant, that doesn't necessarily mean the covenant is unenforceable unless there's a showing of abandonment or waiver. But the problem doesn't mention any other violations except the retiree's fence. However, the retiree's fence might be relevant if the teacher is trying to enforce against the librarian. But the teacher's own lot might not be affected by the retiree's fence. The key point is whether the covenant is still enforceable. If the developer or others didn't enforce the covenant against the retiree, maybe the covenant is considered abandoned. But generally, failure to enforce against one violation doesn't automatically waive the right to enforce against others unless there's a pattern of non-enforcement leading to abandonment. Here, there's only one prior violation mentioned (the retiree's fence), so maybe not enough to abandon the covenant. So, the librarian's fence would still be a violation.\n\nBut wait, restriction (22) creates a franchise right for public utilities in that strip. So, the strip is intended for utilities to have access. If someone builds a fence there, that could interfere with the utility companies' right of ingress and egress. However, the teacher is a private party, not a utility company. So, can the teacher enforce the covenant? The answer depends on whether the covenant benefits the other lot owners. If the restrictions are for the mutual benefit of all the lots in the development, then each owner can enforce them against the others. This is typically the case with subdivision-wide covenants. The fact that the restrictions are part of a general plan suggests they are intended to benefit all the lots. Therefore, the teacher, as an adjacent property owner, would have standing to enforce the covenant against the librarian.\n\nAnother angle: even if the fence doesn't currently block utilities, the restriction is a preventive measure to ensure the utility companies have access. The mere existence of a structure (the fence) violates the covenant, regardless of actual interference. So, the teacher doesn't need to show that the fence is blocking utilities, just that it's a structure in the restricted area. Therefore, the librarian's fence violates restriction (23), and the teacher can seek an injunction.\n\nBut wait, the librarian built the fence along the boundary line with the teacher's lot and along the center of the restricted area. So, maybe the fence is on the librarian's own property but within the 10-foot strip. The strip is along the rear of each lot. If each lot has a 10-foot strip at the rear, then perhaps the fence is within that strip. The restriction prohibits any structure there. So, even if the fence is on the librarian's own land, if it's within the restricted strip, it's prohibited.\n\nAnother possible defense: the librarian might argue that the fence is not a \"structure\" as prohibited. But a fence is generally considered a structure. Even a post-and-rail fence is a structure. So that argument probably fails.\n\nAlternatively, the librarian might argue that the covenant is no longer enforceable due to changed conditions. But there's no mention of any changes in the neighborhood that would make the restriction obsolete. The area is still a residential district, so the original purpose of keeping the utility strip clear likely remains valid.\n\nWhat about the fact that the retiree built a fence in 2000? If the developer didn't enforce the covenant against the retiree, does that mean the covenant is abandoned? But again, one violation might not be enough. Courts usually require more widespread violations to find abandonment. Also, the teacher and librarian bought their lots after the retiree's fence was built, but their deeds still reference the restrictions, so they had notice. The prior violation might not prevent enforcement against subsequent violations unless there's a pattern.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the librarian's fence violates restriction (23), the teacher has standing to enforce the covenant as a neighboring property owner benefitted by the restrictions, and there's no valid defense raised. Therefore, the court would likely grant the mandatory injunction to remove the fence."
