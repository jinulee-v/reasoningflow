        "question": " Which Japanese government promoted a kind of national cult based on the emperor and his associations with kami?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which Japanese government promoted a national cult around the emperor and kami. Let me start by recalling what I know about Japanese history. Kami are Shinto deities or spirits, right? Shinto is Japan's indigenous religion, and it's closely tied to the emperor.\n\nI remember that during the Meiji Restoration in the late 19th century, Japan underwent a lot of changes. The emperor's role was strengthened, and there was a push towards modernization. But I think the national cult part might be related to State Shinto. State Shinto was used to promote the emperor as a divine figure, especially leading up to World War II. \n\nWait, but was it the Meiji government that started this? Or was it later? The Meiji period was from 1868 to 1912. After that, Taisho era, then Showa. The Showa era includes World War II. So maybe the Meiji government established State Shinto, and it continued until the end of WWII. \n\nI also remember that the emperor was considered a living kami, specifically descended from Amaterasu, the sun goddess. This idea was part of the imperial ideology. The government during the Meiji period probably institutionalized this to unify the country and centralize power. They might have used Shinto as a state religion to foster nationalism. \n\nBut I should check if there were specific policies or edicts. The Meiji Constitution of 1889 and the Imperial Rescript on Education in 1890 emphasized loyalty to the emperor. So combining Shinto with state rituals and education would promote this national cult. \n\nThen, during the early Showa period, especially under militarist rule, this emperor worship was intensified. But the question is asking which government promoted it. Since it started in Meiji and continued through Taisho and early Showa, maybe the answer is the Meiji government. But the term \"State Shinto\" was formalized later, though its roots are in Meiji. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the pre-WWII government in general, but the key period when it was established was Meiji. So the answer is the Meiji government. But I need to confirm if State Shinto as a formal institution was a product of Meiji. Yes, after the Meiji Restoration, the government separated Buddhism from Shinto (shinbutsu bunri) and established State Shinto to support imperial authority. So the Meiji government promoted this national cult around the emperor and kami."
