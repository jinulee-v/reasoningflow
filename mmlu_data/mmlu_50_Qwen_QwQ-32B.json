        "question": "A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the angular magnification of a refracting telescope. Let me recall what I know about telescopes. A refracting telescope uses two converging lenses: the objective lens and the eyepiece lens. The angular magnification is given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece, right? But wait, I should make sure I remember the formula correctly.\n\nHmm, angular magnification (M) for a telescope is indeed M = -f_objective / f_eyepiece. The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted, but since we're probably just asked for the magnitude, maybe we can ignore the sign here. Let me check the problem again. It says \"the angular magnification of the telescope is,\" so maybe they just want the absolute value. \n\nThe problem states that the two lenses are separated by 100 cm. Wait a second, in a telescope, the distance between the two lenses when the telescope is adjusted for infinity is the sum of their focal lengths. So, if the separation is 100 cm, then f_objective + f_eyepiece = 100 cm. Since the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm, that would mean the objective has a focal length of 100 - 20 = 80 cm. \n\nTherefore, plugging into the magnification formula, M = f_objective / f_eyepiece = 80 cm / 20 cm = 4. So the angular magnification is 4. But let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any wrong assumptions here.\n\nWait, let me verify the formula again. The angular magnification of a telescope is indeed given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece. The formula is M = -f_o / f_e. Since the problem doesn't specify whether they want the signed magnification or just the magnitude, but in most cases, especially in basic problems, they just want the absolute value. So 4 would be the answer. \n\nBut let me think again about the separation between the lenses. The problem says they are separated by 100 cm. In a telescope, when focused on an object at infinity, the distance between the two lenses is indeed f_o + f_e. So if that's given as 100 cm, and f_e is 20 cm, then f_o must be 80 cm. So that part checks out. \n\nAlternatively, if the separation was different, like when the telescope is focused on a nearby object, the distance between the lenses would be different, but since telescopes are typically used for objects at infinity, the standard formula applies here. The problem doesn't mention any specific object distance, so we can safely assume it's for objects at infinity. \n\nTherefore, the angular magnification should be 80 divided by 20, which is 4. Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me see if there's another way this could be approached. \n\nAlternatively, angular magnification is also defined as the ratio of the angle subtended by the image at the eye to the angle subtended by the object at the unaided eye. In the case of a telescope, the objective forms an image at its focal point, and the eyepiece then acts as a magnifier for that image. The angular magnification would then be the ratio of the focal lengths. \n\nWait, actually, let me think of the derivation. The objective lens has a focal length f_o, and the eyepiece has f_e. When the telescope is adjusted for infinity, the image is formed at the focal point of the eyepiece. The distance between the lenses is then f_o + f_e. \n\nThe angular size of the object as seen through the telescope is (height of the image)/(f_e), because the eyepiece forms an image at infinity (assuming the eye is relaxed), so the angle is approximately height divided by focal length. The original angular size is (height of the object)/f_o, since the objective forms an image at its focal length. \n\nTherefore, the magnification is ( (height/f_e) ) / ( (height/f_o) ) = f_o / f_e. \n\nSo that's consistent with the formula. Therefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the angular magnification is 80/20 = 4. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"angular magnification,\" so maybe they want the answer with a negative sign? But in many textbooks, the angular magnification is given as a positive number when talking about telescopes, especially astronomical telescopes, since the inversion of the image isn't usually a concern for astronomical use. So probably 4 is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if they consider the sign, it would be -4, but since the question doesn't specify, and given the way the problem is phrased, I think 4 is the expected answer. \n\nLet me just check if there's any chance I misread the separation distance. The problem says the two lenses are separated by 100 cm. So f_o + f_e = 100 cm. Since f_e is 20 cm, f_o is 80 cm. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the separation is just f_o, but that would be incorrect. The separation in a telescope is the sum of the focal lengths when focused on infinity. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The angular magnification is 4. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular magnification of the telescope is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the angular magnification of the refracting telescope, we start by noting that the distance between the two lenses (objective and eyepiece) when adjusted for infinity is the sum of their focal lengths. The given separation is 100 cm, and the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm. \n\n1. Calculate the focal length of the objective lens:\n   \\[\n   f_{\\text{objective}} + f_{\\text{eyepiece}} = 100 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f_{\\text{objective}} = 100 \\, \\text{cm} - 20 \\, \\text{cm} = 80 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. The angular magnification \\( M \\) of a telescope is given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{f_{\\text{objective}}}{f_{\\text{eyepiece}}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{80 \\, \\text{cm}}{20 \\, \\text{cm}} = 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, the angular magnification of the telescope is \\boxed{4}."

The given separation is 100 cm, and the eyepiece has a focal length of 20 cm. \n\n1. Calculate the focal length of the objective lens:\n   \\[\n   f_{\\text{objective}} + f_{\\text{eyepiece}} = 100 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f_{\\text{objective}} = 100 \\, \\text{cm} - 20 \\, \\text{cm} = 80 \\, \\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. The angular magnification \\( M \\) of a telescope is given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective to the focal length of the eyepiece:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{f_{\\text{objective}}}{f_{\\text{eyepiece}}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{80 \\, \\text{cm}}{20 \\, \\text{cm}} = 4\n   \\]\n\nThus, the angular magnification of the telescope is \\boxed{4}.",
