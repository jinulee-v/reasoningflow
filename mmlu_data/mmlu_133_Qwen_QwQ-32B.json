        "question": "Which of the following is true of a price floor?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which statement about a price floor is true. Let me start by recalling what a price floor is. From what I remember in my economics class, a price floor is a government-mandated minimum price set above the equilibrium price. The idea is to prevent the price from being too low. Examples include minimum wage laws or agricultural price supports.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the following options is true regarding a price floor. Since the options aren't listed here, I'll have to think of common statements related to price floors and evaluate their accuracy. Let me list some possible statements and analyze them.\n\nFirst, a price floor can lead to a surplus. That makes sense because if the price is set above where the supply and demand curves intersect, the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded. So suppliers are willing to provide more at that higher price, but consumers aren't willing or able to buy as much. That surplus is a classic result of a price floor. So that's probably a correct statement.\n\nAnother possible statement might be that a price floor is always effective in achieving its goal. But I think that's not true because even if the price is set above equilibrium, if the market can't sell all the surplus, there might be other issues. For example, the government might have to buy the excess supply, or there could be black markets. So effectiveness might depend on enforcement and other factors.\n\nAnother common point is that a price floor below the equilibrium price has no effect. That's true because if the price floor is set below where the market naturally would be, the equilibrium price would already be higher, so the floor doesn't constrain anything. The market operates as usual.\n\nWait, but the question is about what's true of a price floor. So maybe the correct answer is that a price floor above equilibrium causes a surplus. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe something about minimum wage? Like, a price floor in the labor market (minimum wage) can lead to unemployment if set too high. That's another effect, so that could be a true statement too.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a price floor can lead to a shortage. Hmm, no, a shortage is when the price is set below equilibrium, like a price ceiling. So a price floor above equilibrium causes surplus, not shortage. So that's a key difference between price floors and ceilings.\n\nAnother possible statement: Price floors are intended to help producers by increasing their revenue. That's true because by setting a minimum price, producers get a higher price for their goods, which can increase their income, assuming they can sell all their products. But if there's a surplus, they might not sell all, so the actual effect might be mixed. But the intention is to help producers.\n\nWait, but the question is which is true, not which is the intention. So the actual effect is surplus. So the true statement would be that a price floor above equilibrium results in a surplus. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a price floor can be binding or non-binding. If it's set above equilibrium, it's binding (has an effect), if below, non-binding. So that's another true statement. But again, the question is which of the options is correct. Since I don't have the options, I need to think of common correct answers.\n\nAnother point: Price floors can lead to government intervention to purchase surplus, like in agriculture. So that's a true consequence. But again, depends on the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement that a price floor causes a deadweight loss. Yes, because the market is not at equilibrium, so there's inefficiency. The surplus represents some transactions that don't happen, leading to a deadweight loss. So that's another true statement.\n\nHmm, so there are multiple true statements about price floors, but the question is probably referring to one of the standard ones. Since the user is asking which is true, and given common exam questions, the most straightforward correct answer is that a price floor set above the equilibrium price results in a surplus. That's the fundamental effect taught in basic economics.\n\nAlternatively, if one of the options was \"a price floor can lead to a shortage,\" that would be incorrect because that's a price ceiling effect. So the key is to distinguish between the two. \n\nAnother possible incorrect statement might be that a price floor increases consumer surplus. That's not true because consumers are paying a higher price than they would at equilibrium, so their surplus decreases. \n\nSo putting this all together, the true statements about a price floor are:\n\n- It can cause a surplus when set above equilibrium.\n\n- It is intended to benefit producers.\n\n- It can lead to government intervention to buy surplus.\n\n- It creates a deadweight loss.\n\nSo if the options include any of these, they would be correct. Since the user hasn't provided the options, but given the way the question is phrased, the most likely correct answer expected here is that a price floor above equilibrium causes a surplus. That's the primary effect taught in textbooks.\n</think>\n\nA price floor, when set above the equilibrium price, leads to a **surplus**. This occurs because the mandated minimum price causes suppliers to produce more than consumers are willing to purchase at that price. Here's a breakdown of key points:\n\n1. **Surplus Creation**: The primary effect of a price floor above equilibrium is an excess supply (surplus), as quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded.\n2. **Intention**: Price floors aim to protect producers by ensuring they receive a minimum price, such as in minimum wage laws or agricultural supports.\n3. **No Effect Below Equilibrium**: If set below equilibrium, the price floor is non-binding and has no economic impact, as the market operates at its natural equilibrium.\n4. **Deadweight Loss**: The surplus represents an inefficient allocation of resources, creating a deadweight loss due to missed transactions.\n5. **Potential Consequences**: Government intervention (e.g., buying surplus) or black markets may arise if the surplus is not resolved.\n\n**Common Incorrect Statements**:\n- A price floor causing a **shortage** (this is a result of a price ceiling, not a floor).\n- A price floor always benefiting producers (if surplus is unsold, producers may face losses despite higher prices).\n- A price floor increasing consumer surplus (consumers pay more, reducing their surplus).\n\n**Most Likely Correct Answer**:  \nA price floor set above the equilibrium price results in a **surplus**. This is the fundamental and most frequently emphasized outcome in economic analysis."
