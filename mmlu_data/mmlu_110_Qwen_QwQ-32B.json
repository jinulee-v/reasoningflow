        "question": "The rate of natural increase of a population is found by subtracting the",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the rate of natural increase of a population. The question says it's found by subtracting something. Hmm, let me think. I remember that population growth can be influenced by births and deaths, right? Maybe it's the difference between births and deaths?\n\nWait, the term \"natural increase\" probably refers to the growth of a population due to births and deaths alone, without considering migration. So, if that's the case, then the rate of natural increase would be calculated by taking the number of births minus the number of deaths in a given time period, divided by the total population, maybe? Or is it just births minus deaths?\n\nLet me check my notes. Oh, here it is: The rate of natural increase is indeed the difference between the birth rate and the death rate. So, if the birth rate is, say, 15 per 1,000 people and the death rate is 8 per 1,000 people, then the natural increase rate would be 7 per 1,000 people per year. That makes sense because it's subtracting deaths from births to see the net growth.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the rate of natural increase of a population is found by subtracting the...\" So they want to know what exactly is being subtracted here. Since it's the rate, maybe they are referring to the formula. The formula for the rate of natural increase (RNI) is:\n\nRNI = (Births - Deaths) / Population \u00d7 1000 (to get it per thousand)\n\nBut maybe they just want the basic subtraction part. The question is phrased as \"subtracting the...\", so probably the number of deaths from the number of births. But actually, since rates are usually per capita, maybe it's the birth rate minus the death rate. Let me confirm.\n\nSuppose a population has a birth rate of 20 per 1000 and a death rate of 5 per 1000. Then the natural increase rate would be 15 per 1000. So yes, it's birth rate minus death rate. Therefore, the rate of natural increase is obtained by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.\n\nAlternatively, if they are talking about the actual number of people, then it's births minus deaths. But since it's a rate, it's more likely the rates being subtracted. Let me see if there's a standard definition.\n\nLooking it up in my textbook: \"The rate of natural increase is the difference between the crude birth rate and the crude death rate.\" So that's definitely birth rate minus death rate. Therefore, the answer should be subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the rate of natural increase of a population is found by subtracting the...\" So the blank is the thing being subtracted. Therefore, the answer is the death rate. So the sentence would be: \"The rate of natural increase of a population is found by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are referring to the number of deaths subtracted from the number of births, and then divided by population? But the question is about the rate, so probably the rates themselves. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the question is from a textbook or a standard question. The standard formula is RNI = (Births - Deaths)/Population * 1000, but as a rate, it's often expressed per 1000 or as a percentage. However, the term \"rate of natural increase\" is indeed the difference between birth and death rates. So the key point is that you subtract the death rate from the birth rate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that you subtract the death rate from the birth rate. Since the question is phrased as \"subtracting the...\", the blank is the death rate. So the completion is \"subtracting the death rate from the birth rate\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the number of deaths subtracted from the number of births, but since it's a rate, it's more precise to use the rates. Let me check an example.\n\nIf a population has 1000 births and 600 deaths in a year, with a population of 100,000, then the natural increase is 400 people. The rate would be (400/100,000)*1000 = 4 per thousand. Alternatively, the birth rate is 10 per thousand (1000/100,000*1000), death rate is 6 per thousand, so 10-6=4. So yes, the rate is birth rate minus death rate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is subtracting the death rate from the birth rate. So the blank is \"the death rate from the birth rate\".\n\nWait, the wording is important. The question says \"the rate of natural increase... is found by subtracting the...\". So the structure is \"subtracting A from B\", so the formula is B - A. Therefore, if you subtract A from B, the result is B - A. So in the sentence, the blank is A, which is the death rate, because you subtract death rate from birth rate. So the answer is \"the death rate\".\n\nWait, hold on. Let me parse the sentence again: \"The rate of natural increase of a population is found by subtracting the...\" So the structure is \"subtracting X\", where X is what you subtract. For example, \"5 is found by subtracting 3 from 8\" means 8 - 3 =5. So here, the rate is equal to (birth rate - death rate), so you subtract the death rate from the birth rate. Therefore, the X here is the death rate. So the blank is \"death rate\".\n\nAlternatively, if the sentence was \"found by subtracting Y from X\", then X - Y. But the way it's phrased is \"subtracting the...\", so the object of subtracting is the death rate. Therefore, the answer is \"the death rate\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the number of deaths subtracted from the number of births, but since it's a rate, the rates are subtracted. Hmm. Let me see if I can find a source.\n\nAccording to the United Nations definitions: \"The rate of natural increase is the excess of births over deaths per 1,000 population per year. It is calculated by subtracting the crude death rate from the crude birth rate.\"\n\nYes, so that's exactly it. So the crude death rate is subtracted from the crude birth rate. Therefore, the answer is \"the crude death rate\" but maybe just \"death rate\".\n\nSince the question doesn't specify \"crude\", but in general terms, it's the death rate. So the answer is \"the death rate\".\n\nTherefore, the completed sentence is: \"The rate of natural increase of a population is found by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate.\"\n\nSo the blank is filled with \"death rate\".\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe rate of natural increase of a population is found by subtracting the \\boxed{death rate} from the birth rate.\n</think>\n\nThe rate of natural increase of a population is calculated by considering the difference between the birth rate and the death rate. Specifically, it is the excess of births over deaths per unit of population. The formula for the rate of natural increase (RNI) is derived by subtracting the death rate from the birth rate. \n\nAccording to standard definitions, the rate of natural increase is the difference between the crude birth rate and the crude death rate. This means that the death rate is subtracted from the birth rate to obtain the natural increase rate. \n\nThus, the completed sentence is:\n\nThe rate of natural increase of a population is found by subtracting the \\boxed{death rate} from the birth rate."
