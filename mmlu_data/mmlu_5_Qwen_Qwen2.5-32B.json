        "question": "What is the embryological origin of the hyoid bone?",
        "response": "The hyoid bone is a unique bone in the human body, as it does not articulate with any other bone. It is located in the anterior midline of the neck, between the mandible and the thyroid cartilage. The hyoid bone is a derivative of the first pharyngeal arch, also known as the mandibular arch. The first pharyngeal arch gives rise to several structures, including the maxilla, mandible, malleus, incus, and the muscles of mastication. The hyoid bone is formed from the fusion of two cartilaginous elements, the hyoid cartilage and the thyrohyoid cartilage, which are derived from the first pharyngeal arch. The hyoid bone plays an important role in the support of the tongue and the larynx, and it also serves as an attachment point for several muscles involved in swallowing and speech."
