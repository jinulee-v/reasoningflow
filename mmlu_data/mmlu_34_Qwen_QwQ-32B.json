        "question": "Which of the following lists the hydrides of group-14 elements in order of thermal stability, from lowest to highest?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the order of thermal stability for the hydrides of group 14 elements, from lowest to highest. Hmm, group 14 elements are carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, and lead, right? Their hydrides would be CH4, SiH4, GeH4, SnH4, and PbH4. \n\nFirst, I remember that thermal stability generally refers to how easily a compound decomposes when heated. So, the more thermally stable a hydride is, the less likely it is to decompose when heated. The question is asking for the order from least to most stable, so starting with the one that decomposes most easily and ending with the one that's the most stable.\n\nI think the trend here has to do with the bond strength between the group 14 element and hydrogen. Since bond strength usually decreases as you go down a group, the hydrides of heavier elements might be less stable because their bonds are weaker. Wait, but I need to be careful here. Let me think again.\n\nCarbon is the first element in group 14. Its hydride is methane (CH4), which is very stable. In fact, methane doesn't decompose easily even at high temperatures. Then silicon's hydride is silane (SiH4). I recall that silane is less stable than methane and can decompose when heated. Germanium hydride (GeH4) is even less stable, and tin hydride (SnH4) might be even more unstable. Lead hydride (PbH4) is probably the least stable of all. \n\nWait, but I should verify this. Let me recall the general trend for group hydrides. For group 14, the stability of the hydrides decreases down the group. That means the thermal stability goes from highest (most stable) at the top (carbon) to lowest (least stable) at the bottom (lead). So the order from least to most stable would be PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4. But the question asks for lowest to highest thermal stability, so that would be PbH4 (lowest) first and CH4 (highest) last. \n\nBut wait, I might be mixing up the trends. Let me think again. Sometimes, the stability can also be related to the electronegativity. Since carbon is more electronegative than the others, the C-H bond is stronger, making methane more stable. As we go down the group, electronegativity decreases, so the bond between the metal and hydrogen becomes weaker, leading to less thermal stability. So yes, that supports the idea that thermal stability decreases down the group. \n\nAnother point: the bond strength between the group 14 element and hydrogen. The bond energy decreases as you go down the group because the atoms get larger and the bonds are longer. Weaker bonds mean the hydrides are more prone to decomposition upon heating, so lower thermal stability. \n\nSo putting it all together, the order from least to most thermally stable should be PbH4 < SnH4 < GeH4 < SiH4 < CH4. \n\nWait, but I should check if there's any exception or something I'm forgetting. For example, sometimes lead hydride is not as straightforward. I think PbH4 is actually not very stable and can decompose even at room temperature, whereas SnH4 (stannane) is a gas that can decompose when heated. Germane (GeH4) is also a gas but less stable than silane. Silane is a gas that can ignite in air, so it's pretty reactive. Methane is a gas that's very stable. \n\nTherefore, the correct order from lowest (least stable) to highest (most stable) thermal stability is PbH4, SnH4, GeH4, SiH4, CH4. \n\nI think that's right. Let me just confirm with another angle. The general trend for group hydrides: in groups like 14, the stability decreases down the group because of increasing atomic size and decreasing bond strength. So yes, the order should be as I mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe hydrides of group 14 elements, from lowest to highest thermal stability, are ordered based on decreasing bond strength and electronegativity as you move down the group. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Lead hydride (PbH\u2084)**: Least thermally stable. It is highly unstable and can decompose even at room temperature due to weak Pb-H bonds.\n2. **Tin hydride (SnH\u2084)**: Less stable than germanium hydride but more stable than lead hydride. It decomposes when heated.\n3. **Germanium hydride (GeH\u2084)**: More stable than tin and lead hydrides but still less stable than silane. It is a gas that decomposes upon heating.\n4. **Silicon hydride (SiH\u2084)**: More stable than the heavier hydrides but still reactive. Silane (SiH\u2084) can ignite in air and decompose when heated.\n5. **Methane (CH\u2084)**: Most thermally stable. Methane is highly stable and does not decompose under normal conditions.\n\n**Order (Lowest to Highest Thermal Stability):**  \n**PbH\u2084 < SnH\u2084 < GeH\u2084 < SiH\u2084 < CH\u2084**\n\nThis trend reflects the weakening bond strength and decreasing electronegativity of the group 14 elements as you move down the periodic table."
