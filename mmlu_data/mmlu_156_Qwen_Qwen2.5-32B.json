        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\nNon-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments\u2026The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\nKwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965\nWhich of the following provides the best context for Nkrumah's writings?",
        "response": "To provide the best context for Nkrumah's writings, it is important to understand the historical and political background of the time. Kwame Nkrumah was the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, which gained independence from British colonial rule in 1957. Nkrumah was a strong advocate for African unity and Pan-Africanism, and he played a significant role in the decolonization movement across the continent.\n\nThe concept of neo-colonialism, as discussed by Nkrumah, refers to the indirect control or influence that former colonial powers exert over newly independent nations, often through economic means. This can include the manipulation of trade agreements, the control of natural resources, and the imposition of economic policies that favor the interests of the former colonial powers over those of the newly independent nations.\n\nIn the context of Nkrumah's writings, the struggle against neo-colonialism is not about excluding foreign investment or capital from operating in less developed countries. Instead, it is about ensuring that the financial power of developed countries is not used in a way that impoverishes the less developed nations. Nkrumah's advocacy for non-alignment, a policy of maintaining independence from both capitalist and socialist blocs, is based on the idea of cooperation with all states, regardless of their economic systems.\n\nThe key issue, as Nkrumah emphasizes, is not the return on foreign investments but the power dynamics involved. A state under neo-colonial control is not truly independent and cannot determine its own destiny. Nkrumah's writings reflect his commitment to the principles of African unity, self-determination, and the fight against the lingering effects of colonialism and imperialism."
