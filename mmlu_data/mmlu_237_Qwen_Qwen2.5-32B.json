        "question": "Krete is an unmarried taxpayer with income exclusively from wages. By December 31, year 1, Krete's employer has withheld $16,000 in federal income taxes and Krete has made no estimated tax payments. On April 15, year 2, Krete timely filed for an extension request to file her individual tax return, and paid $300 of additional taxes. Krete's year 1 tax liability was $16,500 when she timely filed her return on April 30, year 2, and paid the remaining tax liability balance. What amount would be subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes?",
        "response": "To determine the amount subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes, we need to calculate the difference between the amount Krete should have paid in estimated taxes and the amount she actually paid. The formula for calculating the penalty is:\n\nPenalty = (Tax Liability - Estimated Tax Payments) * Penalty Rate\n\nIn this case, Krete's tax liability is $16,500, and she made no estimated tax payments. Therefore, the amount subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes is:\n\nPenalty = ($16,500 - $0) * Penalty Rate\n\nThe penalty rate for underpayment of estimated taxes is 0.5% per month or part of a month that the tax remains unpaid. Since Krete paid $300 of additional taxes on April 15, year 2, and the remaining balance on April 30, year 2, the tax remained unpaid for 1 month and 15 days. Therefore, the penalty rate is 0.5% * 1.5 = 0.75%.\n\nPenalty = ($16,500 - $0) * 0.75% = $123.75\n\nTherefore, the amount subject to the penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes is $123.75."
