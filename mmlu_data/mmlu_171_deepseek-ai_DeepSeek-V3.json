        "question": "What is the judge ad hoc?",
        "response": "A **judge ad hoc** is a temporary judge appointed to serve on an international court or tribunal, typically in cases where a party to a dispute does not have a judge of its nationality already sitting on the bench. This practice ensures that each party in a case has representation and that the court maintains a sense of fairness and impartiality.\n\n### Key Features of a Judge Ad Hoc:\n1. **Appointment**: A judge ad hoc is appointed by a party to a case when there is no judge of its nationality on the court. For example, in the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)**, a state involved in a dispute can appoint a judge ad hoc if it does not already have a judge of its nationality on the bench.\n\n2. **Temporary Role**: The judge ad hoc serves only for the specific case for which they are appointed and does not have a permanent position on the court.\n\n3. **Equal Participation**: The judge ad hoc has the same rights and responsibilities as the other judges on the court during the proceedings, including the right to vote on the decision.\n\n4. **Purpose**: The primary purpose of appointing a judge ad hoc is to ensure that the perspectives and legal traditions of the parties involved are adequately represented, thereby enhancing the legitimacy and fairness of the court's decision.\n\n### Examples:\n- In the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)**, Article 31 of the ICJ Statute allows for the appointment of judges ad hoc.\n- In other international tribunals, such as the **International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)**, similar provisions exist to allow for the appointment of judges ad hoc.\n\n### Criticism:\nWhile the practice aims to ensure fairness, some critics argue that it may introduce bias, as the judge ad hoc is appointed by one of the parties and may be perceived as favoring that party's interests. However, judges ad hoc are expected to act impartially and uphold the integrity of the court.\n\nIn summary, a judge ad hoc is a temporary judicial appointment designed to ensure equitable representation in international legal disputes."
