        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nIn Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe passage displays the direct concern for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which movement the passage from Zola's Germinal is displaying concern for the working classes. Let me start by recalling the context. The book is set in a mining community and deals with labor issues, right? The characters here are discussing the struggles of workers and their attempts to improve their conditions.\n\nSouvarine is talking about his despair over the situation in Russia, mentioning Nihilists who turned to politics but couldn't move beyond national liberation. He criticizes them for focusing on killing the despot instead of broader social change. Then he talks about his own failed efforts to create a fraternal society among workers, sharing his resources but failing to achieve true unity. \n\nHe also criticizes French workers who, after winning a lottery, invest the money to live idle lives, which he sees as a betrayal of collective solidarity. The key points here are the emphasis on workers' welfare, critique of bourgeois aspirations among workers, and the idea of a communal society. \n\nNow, thinking about historical movements concerned with workers' welfare. Socialism comes to mind, especially since it's about collective ownership and workers' rights. But there's also communism, which is more about a classless society. Anarchism might be another possibility since Souvarine seems disillusioned with political approaches and maybe advocates for more direct action. \n\nWait, Souvarine is a character in Germinal, and Zola was a naturalist writer. The Nihilists mentioned were a Russian movement, but the question is about the movement that typically showed concern for the working class as depicted here. The passage criticizes workers who want to become bourgeois, which aligns with Marxist ideas of class struggle. Marx talked about workers (proletariat) overthrowing the bourgeoisie. The mention of a fraternal society and common labor sounds like socialism or communism. \n\nBut the passage also talks about the failure of fusion between the intellectual and the workers, which might relate to the challenges faced by socialist movements in gaining worker support. The rejection of individual gain (like the lottery winners) in favor of collective welfare is a socialist ideal. So the movement here is likely socialism, or more specifically, revolutionary socialism or communism. \n\nWait, the Nihilists in Russia were different; they were more about anarchism and destruction of the existing order. But Souvarine's own ideas seem more aligned with anarcho-communism perhaps, but the question is asking which movement typically had this concern. Since the passage is from 1885, around the time when socialist and communist movements were gaining traction, especially in Europe. The International Workingmen's Association (First International) was a thing then, which included various socialist, communist, and anarchist groups. \n\nBut the key here is the direct concern for workers' welfare and the critique of workers wanting to become bourgeois. That's a classic Marxist critique, where true emancipation comes from collective action, not individual advancement. So the answer is probably socialism, or more specifically, Marxism. However, the options might be broader. Since the passage is from Zola, who was associated with naturalism but the content here is about workers' movements. \n\nAlternatively, the mention of fraternity and common labor might point to utopian socialism, but utopian socialism was earlier. The more likely answer is socialism in general, or communism. Since the question says \"typically a part of which movement,\" and given the time period (1885), Marxism was a significant movement. So the answer is socialism or communism. But I need to check the exact terms. \n\nThe passage's themes align with Marxist ideas: class struggle, critique of bourgeois aspirations, emphasis on collective action. Therefore, the movement is socialism, specifically Marxist socialism. Alternatively, communism as well. But in the context of the 19th-century European labor movements, socialism was the broader term encompassing these ideas. The answer is likely socialism."
