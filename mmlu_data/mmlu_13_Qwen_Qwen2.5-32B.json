        "question": "Why isn't there a planet where the asteroid belt is located?",
        "response": "The asteroid belt is located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It is a region of the Solar System where a large number of asteroids are found. These asteroids are remnants from the early formation of the Solar System and are too small to form a planet. The gravitational influence of Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System, prevents the asteroids from coalescing into a planet. Instead, they remain as a collection of rocky bodies, ranging in size from small boulders to large objects hundreds of kilometers in diameter."
