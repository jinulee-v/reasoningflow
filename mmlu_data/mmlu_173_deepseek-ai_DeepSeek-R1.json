    "raw_text": {
        "question": "When 'consent' can serve as a circumstance precluding the wrongfulness of a State conduct?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out when consent can make a state's actions not wrongful. Let me start by recalling what I know about international law and state responsibility. \n\nFirst, I remember that the International Law Commission (ILC) has some articles on State Responsibility. One of the circumstances that can preclude wrongfulness is consent. But how exactly does that work?\n\nConsent means that a state has agreed to another state's action that would otherwise be a breach of international law. But there must be conditions attached. For example, the consent has to be given by a competent authority, right? Like, a proper representative of the state, not just some random official. Also, the consent should be freely given, without coercion. If a state is forced to give consent under duress, that might invalidate it.\n\nAnother thing is the scope. The consent must be specific to the action taken. So if State A consents to State B conducting a search and rescue operation in its territorial waters, State B can't use that consent to justify, say, military exercises there. The action has to be within the bounds of what was agreed upon.\n\nAlso, the consent can't violate a peremptory norm (jus cogens). Even if a state consents, actions like genocide, slavery, or torture are still illegal no matter what. So consent can't justify those actions.\n\nTemporal factors might matter too. Consent has to be given before the action takes place. Retroactive consent might not work unless it's explicitly agreed upon. And the consent can be withdrawn, but once the action is done, withdrawal doesn't make the past actions wrongful again. But if the action is ongoing, withdrawing consent would require the other state to stop.\n\nI should also think about examples. Like, when a state allows another's military aircraft to fly through its airspace. Without consent, that's a violation of sovereignty, but with consent, it's okay. But if the consent was obtained through threats, then it's not valid. Or if the action goes beyond what was consented, like staying longer than permitted.\n\nWait, what about the difference between consent and invitation? Like in cases of intervention. If a government invites another state to help with internal conflict, that's consent. But if there's a dispute about the legitimacy of the government, like during a civil war, consent from one faction might not be valid if another is recognized as the legitimate authority.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of error or fraud. If a state is misled into giving consent, maybe that invalidates it. But I'm not sure how international law handles that. Probably similar to general contract principles where consent obtained through fraud isn't valid.\n\nSo putting it all together, consent precludes wrongfulness when it's given voluntarily, by the proper authority, specific to the action, doesn't breach jus cogens, and is given prior to the action. Also, it can't be withdrawn retroactively but can affect ongoing actions.\n\nI should check if there are any relevant cases. The Corfu Channel case comes to mind, where the ICJ said that a state's right to territorial sovereignty includes the right to exclude other states. So entry without consent is a violation. But with consent, it's okay. Another case might be the Military and Paramilitary Activities in Nicaragua, where the ICJ held that the U.S. actions weren't justified by consent because the consent wasn't valid from the legitimate government.\n\nAlso, the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, specifically Article 20, which says valid consent by a state to another state's act precludes wrongfulness, provided the act stays within the consent's limits.\n\nSo summarizing, the key points are validity (proper authority, free of coercion), scope (specific and within limits), timing (prior), and not violating jus cogens. Examples help illustrate these points, and cases like Nicaragua and Corfu Channel support this."
