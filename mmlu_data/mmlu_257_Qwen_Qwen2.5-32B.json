        "response": "The Vatican is a small independent city-state located within Rome, Italy. In 2010, the Vatican faced significant criticism and accusations of child abuse cover-ups. The Vatican was accused of not taking appropriate action against priests who were accused of child abuse, and of transferring them to other parishes or countries where they could continue to abuse children. The Vatican denied these accusations, but the allegations led to a significant loss of trust in the Catholic Church and the Vatican."
