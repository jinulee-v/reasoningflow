        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I really loved my newborn baby boy. Scenario 2 | The new girl is embarrassed to live in a trailer park, so I invite the class to her house.",
        "response": "In scenario 2, the main character does something clearly morally wrong. Inviting the entire class to the new girl's house without her consent or knowledge can be considered an invasion of privacy and may cause embarrassment or discomfort for the girl. This action goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which emphasize respect for others' privacy and feelings."
