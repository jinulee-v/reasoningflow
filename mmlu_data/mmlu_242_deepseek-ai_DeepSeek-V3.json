        "response": "Judicial notice is a rule in the law of evidence that allows a court to accept certain facts as true without requiring formal proof, typically because the facts are either (1) generally known within the jurisdiction or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to reliable sources. However, not all facts are appropriate for judicial notice. \n\nThe following is **not** an appropriate kind of fact for judicial notice:\n\n**Controversial or disputed facts**: Facts that are subject to reasonable dispute or are not widely accepted as true are not appropriate for judicial notice. Judicial notice is reserved for facts that are indisputable or universally recognized, not for facts that are open to debate or require evidence to establish their truth.\n\nFor example:\n- **Appropriate for judicial notice**: The fact that water boils at 100\u00b0C at sea level or that July 4th is Independence Day in the United States.\n- **Not appropriate for judicial notice**: The cause of a specific event (e.g., the cause of a fire) or the credibility of a witness, as these are matters that require evidence and are subject to dispute.\n\nIn summary, judicial notice is not appropriate for facts that are controversial, disputed, or require evidentiary support to establish their truth."
