        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is not sure that he will always have work, he is not sure that he will always be healthy, and he foresees that he will one day be old and unfit to work. If he falls into poverty, even if only through a prolonged illness, he is then completely helpless, exam_ins to his own devices, and society does not currently recognize any real obligation towards him beyond the usual help for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so faithfully and diligently. The usual help for the poor, however, leaves a lot to be desired, especially in large cities, where it is very much worse than in the country.\"\nOtto von Bismarck, 1884\nOtto von Bismarck likely made this speech in reaction to which of the following issues?",
        "response": "Otto von Bismarck likely made this speech in reaction to the **social and economic challenges faced by industrial workers during the Industrial Revolution**. Specifically, he was addressing the **insecurity and lack of social welfare protections** for workers, such as unemployment, illness, and old age. This speech aligns with Bismarck's efforts to introduce **social insurance programs** in Germany during the 1880s, including health insurance, accident insurance, and old-age pensions, to mitigate the risks of poverty and social unrest among the working class. These reforms were part of his broader strategy to strengthen the state and reduce the appeal of socialist movements."
