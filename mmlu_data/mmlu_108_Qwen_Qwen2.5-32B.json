        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nThe excerpts below are from the Navigation Acts of 1651.\n[A]fter the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, and from thence forwards, no goods or commodities whatsoever of the growth, production or manufacture of Asia, Africa or America, or of any part thereof; or of any islands belonging to them, or which are described or laid down in the usual maps or cards of those places, as well of the English plantations as others, shall be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or into Ireland, or any other lands, islands, plantations, or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but only in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, or the plantations thereof, as the proprietors or right owners thereof; and whereof the master and mariners are also of the people of this Commonwealth, under the penalty of the forfeiture and loss of all the goods that shall be imported contrary to this act, , , ,\n[N]o goods or commodities of the growth, production, or manufacture of Europe, or of any part thereof, shall after the first day of December, one thousand six hundred fifty and one, be imported or brought into this Commonwealth of England, or any other lands or territories to this Commonwealth belonging, or in their possession, in any ship or ships, vessel or vessels whatsoever, but in such as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of this Commonwealth, and in no other, except only such foreign ships and vessels as do truly and properly belong to the people of that country or place, of which the said goods are the growth, production or manufacture.\nWhich of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?",
        "response": "The Navigation Acts of 1651 were a series of laws passed by the English Parliament to regulate trade and commerce. The main purpose of these acts was to protect and promote English trade and industry by restricting the import and export of goods to and from England and its colonies. The acts also aimed to prevent foreign competition and to ensure that English merchants and shipowners had a monopoly on trade with the colonies. The outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651 was that they helped to establish England as a major trading power and to promote the growth of English industry and commerce. However, they also led to tensions with other European powers and contributed to the outbreak of the Anglo-Dutch Wars."
