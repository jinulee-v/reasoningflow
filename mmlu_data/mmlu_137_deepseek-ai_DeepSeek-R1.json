        "question": "A photocell of work function \u03d5 = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the current through the resistor in a photocell circuit. The photocell has a work function of 2 eV, and the light hitting it has a frequency of 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 Hz and a power of 100 W. Hmm, alright. Let me recall the photoelectric effect and related formulas.\n\nFirst, the work function \u03d5 is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal surface. The energy of each photon is given by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the light. Then, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons would be E_kinetic = hf - \u03d5. But wait, since the photocell is connected to a resistor in series, does that mean the electrons have to do work against the resistor? Or is the resistor just part of the circuit where the current is measured?\n\nActually, once electrons are ejected, they create a current. The current should depend on the number of electrons ejected per second, right? So maybe the key here is to find the number of photons per second, and then see how many of those result in ejected electrons, which contribute to the current.\n\nBut wait, the work function is 2 eV. Let me check if the photon energy is sufficient to overcome the work function. Let's compute E_photon = hf. Planck's constant h is approximately 4.135667696\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2075 eV\u00b7s. So E_photon = 4.135667696\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2075 eV\u00b7s * 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 Hz = 4.135667696 eV. Okay, that's more than 2 eV, so each photon has enough energy to eject an electron. Therefore, every photon can potentially cause a photoelectron to be emitted, assuming all the energy is transferred and there are no losses. But in reality, maybe not every photon results in an electron, but the problem doesn't mention any efficiency, so I think we can assume that every photon ejects one electron.\n\nSo, the next step is to find the number of photons per second. The power P is 100 W, which is 100 Joules per second. Each photon has energy E_photon in Joules. Let me convert E_photon from eV to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J, so E_photon = 4.135667696 eV * 1.602\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J/eV \u2248 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J. Wait, that's actually Planck's constant in J\u00b7s. Wait, hold on. Let me recast that.\n\nWait, Planck's constant h is 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s. So E_photon = hf = 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s * 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 Hz = 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J per photon. Then, the power P is 100 J/s, so the number of photons per second is P / E_photon = 100 J/s / 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J/photon \u2248 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 photons per second.\n\nIf each photon ejects one electron, then the number of electrons per second is the same as the number of photons per second. The current I is the charge per second, so I = e * n, where e is the elementary charge (1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C) and n is the number of electrons per second.\n\nSo I = 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C/electron * 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 electrons/second \u2248 24.16 C/s = 24.16 A. Wait, that seems really high. 24 Amps from 100 W light? But 100 W is the power of the light, not the electrical power. Wait, but in the photoelectric effect, the energy of the photons is being converted into the kinetic energy of the electrons, but the current is just dependent on the number of electrons ejected, right?\n\nWait, but hold on. The power of the light is 100 W, which is the energy per second delivered by the photons. Each photon has energy E_photon, so the number of photons per second is P / E_photon. Then, each photon gives rise to one electron, assuming the efficiency is 100%, which the problem probably assumes. So the current should be (P / E_photon) * e.\n\nBut let's check the units. P is in J/s, E_photon is in J, so P / E_photon is photons/s. Multiply by e (C/photon), gives C/s = A. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut let me verify the numbers again. E_photon = hf = 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 * 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 = 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J. Then, number of photons per second is 100 / 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070. Multiply by 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C per electron gives 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 * 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 24.16 A. That's 24 Amps. But 24 Amps is a huge current for a resistor in series with a photocell. Is that realistic?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think again. The power of the light is 100 W, which is the energy per second. Each photon's energy is hf, which we calculated as approximately 4.135 eV. But in the photoelectric effect, the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons is hf - \u03d5. However, once the electrons are ejected, their kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy as they move through the circuit. But wait, if the photocell is connected to a resistor, then the electrons lose their kinetic energy as heat in the resistor. But how does that affect the current?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing power and current here. The current is determined by the number of electrons flowing per second, regardless of their kinetic energy. The kinetic energy would relate to the voltage, right? Because the voltage is related to the energy per charge. So the stopping potential is V = (hf - \u03d5)/e. But in this case, the resistor is in series, so the current would be determined by the number of electrons emitted per second, and the voltage across the resistor would be I*R. But the problem doesn't give the resistance value. Wait, hold on. The problem just says the photocell is connected to a resistor in series. But without knowing the resistance, how can we find the current? Wait, maybe the resistor is just part of the circuit, and the current is determined solely by the photoelectric effect, assuming that the resistor doesn't limit the current? But that doesn't make sense. If there's a resistor, the current would depend on the voltage and the resistance via Ohm's law. But since the resistor is in series, the current through the resistor is the same as the current from the photocell.\n\nWait, maybe we need to consider the maximum current possible, which is the saturation current, where all the emitted electrons are collected. In that case, the current is determined solely by the number of electrons emitted per second, which is what I calculated earlier. But if there's a resistor, unless the resistor's voltage drop is less than the stopping potential, the current would be reduced. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me recall the photoelectric effect in circuits. When light hits the photocathode, electrons are emitted if the photon energy exceeds the work function. These electrons are then accelerated towards the anode if there's a potential difference. If the circuit is open, electrons accumulate on the anode, creating a potential difference until the electric field stops further emission (the stopping potential). If the circuit is closed with a resistor, the electrons flow through the resistor, creating a current. The maximum current (saturation current) occurs when all emitted electrons are collected, which depends on the intensity (power) of the light. The voltage across the resistor would be V = IR. If the resistor is too large, the voltage could reach the stopping potential, after which current would cease. But if the resistor is small enough that V < stopping potential, then the current is determined by the number of photons.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the resistance. So maybe we are to assume that the resistor is such that the current is the saturation current, i.e., all emitted electrons contribute to the current. In that case, the current is just the number of electrons emitted per second times the charge per electron, which is what I calculated earlier as ~24 A. But that seems very high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 100 W of light power. Each photon has energy 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J. Number of photons per second is 100 / 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 1.5\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 photons/s. Each photon gives one electron, so 1.5\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 electrons/s. Each electron is 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C, so 1.5\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 * 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 = 24 C/s = 24 A. So yes, 24 Amps. But is that possible? 100 W light, 24 A current. If the voltage is V = IR, but if R is very low, then V would be low. For example, if R is 0.1 Ohms, then V = 24 * 0.1 = 2.4 V. But the stopping voltage here would be (hf - \u03d5)/e = (4.135 eV - 2 eV)/e = 2.135 V. So if the resistor is such that IR < 2.135 V, then the current would be 24 A. But if R is larger, then the current would be less. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify R. So maybe the question is assuming that the resistor is small enough that the current is saturated. But how can we know?\n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting us to calculate the maximum possible current, i.e., the saturation current, which is indeed given by the number of electrons emitted per second. Since the problem doesn't mention any resistance value, perhaps that's the case. So the answer would be 24 A. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into the energy in the resistor. The power dissipated in the resistor would be I\u00b2R, but also the power supplied by the photocell would be IV, where V is the voltage. But the voltage here would be the energy per electron, which is (hf - \u03d5)/e. So V = (hf - \u03d5)/e = (4.135 eV - 2 eV)/e = 2.135 V. Then, the power would be P = IV, so I = P / V = 100 W / 2.135 V \u2248 46.8 A. Wait, but that contradicts the previous result.\n\nWait, this is confusing. There are two different approaches here. One is calculating the number of electrons emitted per second, leading to a current of 24 A. The other is taking the power of the light and dividing by the voltage to get current, leading to 46.8 A. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, the power of the light is 100 W, which is the energy delivered by the photons per second. Each photon's energy is hf, and the number of photons is P / hf. Each photon ejects an electron with kinetic energy (hf - \u03d5). So the total energy delivered to the electrons per second is (hf - \u03d5) * (P / hf). That would be the power going into the kinetic energy of the electrons. Then, if all that energy is dissipated in the resistor, the power in the resistor would be I^2 R. But also, the power in the resistor can be written as IV, where V is the voltage across the resistor. But the voltage here would be related to the kinetic energy per electron. The kinetic energy per electron is (hf - \u03d5), which is also equal to eV, where V is the voltage. So V = (hf - \u03d5)/e. Then, the power in the resistor is I * V = I * (hf - \u03d5)/e. But the power supplied by the light is the energy given to the electrons, which is (hf - \u03d5) * (P / hf). Therefore:\n\nI * (hf - \u03d5)/e = (hf - \u03d5) * (P / hf)\n\nSimplify:\n\nI = e * P / hf\n\nWhich is the same as before: I = (e * P) / (hf) = (1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C * 100 W) / (6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s * 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 Hz)\n\nWait, but hf is the energy per photon. Let me compute this again:\n\nI = (e * P) / (hf) = (1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C * 100 J/s) / (6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J) \u2248 (1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2077) / (6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079) \u2248 24.16 A.\n\nSo this gives the same result as before. So even though the kinetic energy per electron is (hf - \u03d5), the current is determined by the number of electrons, not their kinetic energy. The kinetic energy affects the voltage, but the current is just the number of electrons per second times the charge per electron. Therefore, even if the electrons have kinetic energy, the current is still I = e * (number of electrons per second) = e * (P / hf). Therefore, the answer is approximately 24 A.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement mentions the work function. If the work function is 2 eV, and the photon energy is 4.135 eV, then each electron has a kinetic energy of 2.135 eV. But how does that affect the current? It doesn't directly. The current is just the flow of charge, regardless of the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy would relate to the voltage. So if the resistor has a voltage V, then the power dissipated is IV, which should equal the power supplied by the photocell. The power supplied by the photocell is the kinetic energy per electron times the number of electrons per second, which is (hf - \u03d5) * (P / hf) = (4.135 eV - 2 eV) * (100 W / 4.135 eV). Wait, let's compute that:\n\nFirst, convert 100 W into eV/s. Since 1 eV = 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J, 100 W = 100 J/s = 100 / 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 eV/s \u2248 6.25\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 eV/s.\n\nThen, the power supplied to the electrons is (4.135 - 2) eV * (6.25\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 eV/s / 4.135 eV) \u2248 2.135 eV * 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 /s \u2248 3.22\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 eV/s. Convert back to watts: 3.22\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 eV/s * 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J/eV \u2248 51.52 J/s = 51.52 W. So the power dissipated in the resistor would be 51.52 W, which is less than the 100 W of the light. The remaining power is presumably lost as heat in the metal plate or something else. But since the problem doesn't mention efficiency, maybe we are supposed to ignore that and just calculate the current based on the number of electrons.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, the current is 24 A regardless of the kinetic energy. Because current is just charge per second. So even if each electron has more kinetic energy, the number of electrons is still determined by the number of photons. So unless the kinetic energy affects the emission rate, which it doesn't once you're above the work function. So I think the answer is 24 A.\n\nBut let me check with another approach. The current is given by I = (P / E_photon) * e. So substituting numbers:\n\nP = 100 W, E_photon = hf = 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 * 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 = 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J.\n\nNumber of photons per second: 100 / 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070.\n\nEach photon gives one electron, so number of electrons per second: 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070.\n\nCurrent: 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 * 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 24.16 A.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So even though each electron has kinetic energy, the current is just the number of electrons flowing. Therefore, the answer should be approximately 24 A. But let me check if there's a mistake in unit conversions.\n\nWait, Planck's constant h is 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s. Frequency f is 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 Hz. So E_photon = 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 * 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 = 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J. Correct.\n\nPower P = 100 J/s. Number of photons per second: 100 / 6.626\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070. Correct.\n\nCharge per electron: 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C. Current: 1.51\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 * 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 = 1.51 * 1.6 * 10\u00b9 = 2.416 * 10\u00b9 \u2248 24.16 A. Correct.\n\nSo unless there's a trick here, the answer should be approximately 24 A. But the problem mentions the work function. If the work function is 2 eV, and the photon energy is 4.135 eV, then each electron has kinetic energy 2.135 eV. But how does that affect the current? It doesn't. The current is independent of the kinetic energy of the electrons. The kinetic energy would relate to the voltage. If the resistor has a resistance R, then the voltage across it is V = IR. The kinetic energy per electron is (hf - \u03d5) = eV, so V = (hf - \u03d5)/e \u2248 (4.135 - 2)/1 \u2248 2.135 V. Therefore, if the resistor has a voltage of 2.135 V, then the current would be I = V/R. But since the problem doesn't specify R, we can't calculate it that way. However, if the resistor allows the current to flow such that the voltage doesn't exceed 2.135 V, then R would be V/I = 2.135 V / 24.16 A \u2248 0.088 Ohms. But since R isn't given, perhaps the question assumes that the resistor is such that the current is the maximum possible, i.e., saturation current, which is 24 A. Therefore, the answer is approximately 24 A.\n\nBut let me check standard references. In the photoelectric effect, the saturation current is proportional to the intensity (power) of the light, which is consistent with our calculation. So yes, the current should be 24 A. Therefore, the answer is approximately 24 A. But let me check if the exact value is different.\n\nWait, let's compute more precisely:\n\nE_photon = hf = 6.62607015\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s * 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 Hz = 6.62607015\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J.\n\nNumber of photons per second: 100 / 6.62607015\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 100 / 6.62607015 * 10\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 15.097 * 10\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 1.5097\u00d710\u00b2\u2070.\n\nCurrent: 1.5097\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 * 1.602176634\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 (1.5097 * 1.602176634) * 10\u00b9 \u2248 2.418 * 10\u00b9 \u2248 24.18 A.\n\nSo approximately 24.2 A. Rounding to two significant figures, since the given values are 2 eV (one significant figure?), wait: \u03d5 = 2 eV (one significant figure?), f = 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 Hz (one significant figure?), P = 100 W (two significant figures). Hmm, tricky. The work function is given as 2 eV, which is one significant figure. The frequency is 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075, which is one significant figure. The power is 100 W, which is two. So the least number of significant figures is one, but usually, we take the smallest given. However, sometimes 100 W could be considered as three significant figures if the trailing zeros are significant, but without a decimal, it's ambiguous. But since the problem is from a textbook, maybe they expect two significant figures because of 100 W. But 2 eV is one sig fig. Hmm. Maybe the answer is 24 A, which is two sig figs. But if strictly following sig figs, since 2 eV is one sig fig, the answer should be 20 A. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the question expects an exact answer using e.g., e = 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 C, h = 6.63\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 J\u00b7s, leading to:\n\nE_photon = 6.63\u00d710\u207b\u00b3\u2074 * 1\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 = 6.63\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 J.\n\nNumber of photons per second: 100 / 6.63\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 1.508\u00d710\u00b2\u2070.\n\nCurrent: 1.508\u00d710\u00b2\u2070 * 1.6\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2079 \u2248 24.13 A \u2248 24 A.\n\nSo 24 A is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is approximately 24 Amps.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe current through the resistor is \\boxed{24} A."
