        "question": "As of 2019, about what percentage of Americans agree that the state is run for the benefit of all the people?",
        "response": "As of 2019, public opinion surveys indicated that a significant portion of Americans were skeptical about whether the state was run for the benefit of all the people. According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2019, only about **30% of Americans** believed that the government was run for the benefit of all the people. In contrast, a majority (around **66%**) felt that the government was primarily run to benefit a few big interests. This reflects a long-standing sentiment of distrust in government and concerns about inequality and political influence in the United States."
