        "question": "Which of the following best states an argument made by James Madison in The Federalist number 10?",
        "response": "In *The Federalist No. 10*, James Madison argues that a large republic is the best form of government to control the dangers of **factions** (groups of citizens with interests contrary to the rights of others or the interests of the community). Madison contends that factions are inevitable due to the nature of human beings, but their negative effects can be mitigated in a large, diverse republic. In such a system, the sheer number of factions and their competing interests make it difficult for any single faction to dominate, and elected representatives can filter and balance these interests for the common good. This argument supports the idea of a strong, centralized federal government as established by the U.S. Constitution."
