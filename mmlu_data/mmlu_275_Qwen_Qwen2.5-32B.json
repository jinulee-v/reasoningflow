        "question": "Why are parvoviruses a highly impactful parasite?",
        "response": "Parvoviruses are a highly impactful parasite because they are able to infect a wide range of hosts, including humans, animals, and plants. They are also able to replicate quickly and efficiently, which allows them to spread rapidly through populations. Additionally, parvoviruses are able to evade the host's immune system, which makes them difficult to treat and control. This combination of factors makes parvoviruses a highly impactful parasite that can cause significant harm to their hosts."
