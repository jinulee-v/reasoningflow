        "question": "A son owed a creditor $5,000. The son's father contacted the creditor and told him that he wanted to pay the son's debt. The father signed a document that stated the father would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. The creditor made no written or oral commitment to forbear to sue the son to collect the $5,000 debt, and the father made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. For the next five months, the father made and the creditor accepted the $500 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, the creditor, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against the son. However, the father then informed the creditor that he would make no further payments on the debt. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement?",
        "response": "The most persuasive argument that the father is liable to the creditor under the terms of their agreement is that the father signed a document stating that he would pay the son's debt at a rate of $500 a month for 10 months. This document serves as a written agreement between the father and the creditor, and the father has already made five payments as agreed. Therefore, the father is legally bound to continue making the agreed-upon payments until the debt is fully paid off."
