        "question": "What is the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the approximate mean cranial capacity of Homo erectus. Let me start by recalling what cranial capacity means. It's the volume of the braincase, right? So it's a measure of how big the brain was in these ancient humans. \n\nHomo erectus is an extinct species that lived from about 1.9 million years ago to maybe 143,000 years ago. They were important because they were the first to leave Africa and spread to other parts of the world. Now, their brain size is a key feature in human evolution. \n\nI remember that earlier hominins like Australopithecus had smaller brains, around 400-500 cubic centimeters. Then Homo habilis, which came before Homo erectus, had a cranial capacity of about 600 cm\u00b3. So Homo erectus should be bigger than that. \n\nWait, I think Homo erectus had a larger brain. Maybe around 750 to 1250 cm\u00b3? But I need to be precise here. Let me think. I've heard different numbers before. Some sources say the average is around 900 cm\u00b3. But there's variation because different specimens might have different sizes. \n\nFor example, the Turkana Boy, which is a well-preserved Homo erectus skeleton, had a cranial capacity of about 900 cm\u00b3. But some Asian Homo erectus specimens, like those from Java or China, might have had larger capacities, maybe up to 1200 cm\u00b3. So the range is probably between 700 and 1250, but the mean would be somewhere in the middle. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the mean. So maybe the average is around 900-1000 cm\u00b3? Let me check my memory again. I think the commonly cited average is approximately 900 cubic centimeters. But I should also consider that there's a range. Some studies might put it lower or higher depending on the sample. \n\nAnother point is that cranial capacity can vary based on the sex and age of the individual. But when they talk about the mean for the species, they probably average across all known specimens. \n\nHmm, I should also remember that Homo erectus existed over a long period and across different regions, so there might be some evolutionary increase in brain size over time. Early Homo erectus might have smaller brains compared to later ones. \n\nWait, I think the Dmanisi skulls from Georgia have smaller capacities, maybe around 600 cm\u00b3, but some argue they might belong to an earlier species or a variant. So maybe the Dmanisi specimens are outliers. \n\nPutting this all together, the generally accepted mean cranial capacity for Homo erectus is around 900 cm\u00b3. But I should confirm if there's a more precise number. Maybe 900 is the average, but some sources might say 850 or 950. Let me see if I can recall any specific studies. \n\nOh, right, the Smithsonian Human Origins Program states that Homo erectus had a cranial capacity ranging from about 700 to 1250 cm\u00b3, with an average of approximately 900 cm\u00b3. That seems to align with what I was thinking. \n\nSo the answer should be around 900 cubic centimeters. But I should present it as an approximate mean, acknowledging the range. The question asks for the approximate mean, so 900 cm\u00b3 is the figure to go with.\n</think>\n\nThe approximate mean cranial capacity of *Homo erectus* is **around 900 cubic centimeters (cm\u00b3)**. However, there is significant variation among individuals and populations, with estimates ranging from approximately **700 cm\u00b3 to 1,250 cm\u00b3**. This range reflects differences in geographic distribution (e.g., smaller capacities in early African specimens like those from Dmanisi, Georgia, and larger capacities in some Asian specimens) as well as potential evolutionary changes over time. The commonly cited average of ~900 cm\u00b3 is based on well-known fossils such as the Turkana Boy (KNM-WT 15000), which had a cranial capacity of about 900 cm\u00b3. This increase from earlier hominins (e.g., *Homo habilis*) highlights *Homo erectus*'s advanced cognitive capabilities and role in human evolution. \n\n**Key points:**  \n- **Mean:** ~900 cm\u00b3  \n- **Range:** ~700\u20131,250 cm\u00b3  \n- **Context:** Represents a significant increase from earlier hominins, supporting complex behaviors like tool use and migration out of Africa."
