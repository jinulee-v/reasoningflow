        "question": "On January 1, year 1, Alpha Co. signed an annual maintenance agreement with a software provider for $15,000 and the maintenance period begins on March 1, year 2. Alpha also incurred $5,000 of costs on January 1, year 1, related to software modification requests that will increase the functionality of the software. Alpha depreciates and amortizes its computer and software assets over five years using the straight-line method. What amount is the total expense that Alpha should recognize related to the maintenance agreement and the software modifications for the year ended December 31, year 1?",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the total expense Alpha Co. should recognize for the year ended December 31, year 1, related to the maintenance agreement and the software modifications. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the maintenance agreement. Alpha signed it on January 1, year 1, for $15,000, but the maintenance period doesn't start until March 1, year 2. So, the service period begins in March of the next year. Since the service hasn't started yet in year 1, I don't think Alpha should recognize any expense for the maintenance agreement in year 1. Instead, the $15,000 is probably a prepayment for services to be received starting in year 2. So, maybe that $15,000 is recorded as a prepaid asset on January 1, year 1, and then expensed starting from March 1, year 2, over the maintenance period. Therefore, for the year ending December 31, year 1, there's no expense related to the maintenance agreement. That part might be $0 expense in year 1.\n\nNext, the software modification costs. Alpha incurred $5,000 on January 1, year 1, to increase the functionality of the software. These costs are likely to be capitalized as part of the software's cost because they enhance the software's functionality. Since they are capitalized, Alpha would amortize these costs over the software's useful life. The problem states that Alpha uses straight-line depreciation/amortization over five years. So, the $5,000 should be amortized over five years.\n\nLet me check the dates again. The modification was done on January 1, year 1, so the amortization period starts from that date. For the year ended December 31, year 1, that's a full year. Therefore, the amortization expense for the software modifications would be $5,000 divided by 5 years, which is $1,000 per year. So, in year 1, the expense related to the software modifications is $1,000.\n\nWait, but hold on. The maintenance agreement is $15,000, but since the service period starts in March 1, year 2, does that mean the entire $15,000 is for a 12-month period starting March 1, year 2? If so, then even if they paid it on January 1, year 1, the service hasn't been provided yet, so it's a prepaid expense. Therefore, no part of it should be expensed in year 1. So, correct, the entire $15,000 would be recognized as an expense starting from March 1, year 2, over the next 12 months. Therefore, in year 1, no expense for maintenance.\n\nFor the software modification, since it's capitalized and amortized over five years starting from January 1, year 1, the amortization expense for year 1 is $1,000. Therefore, total expense for year 1 is $0 (maintenance) + $1,000 (software amortization) = $1,000.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The problem says \"the total expense that Alpha should recognize related to the maintenance agreement and the software modifications.\" So, maintenance agreement expense and software modification expense. The maintenance hasn't started, so $0. The software modifications are capitalized and amortized, so $1,000. So total expense is $1,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $5,000 software modification is not a separate asset but part of the existing software. But regardless, if it's increasing the functionality, it's capitalized and amortized. So, yes, $1,000 per year.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $1,000. Let me confirm again.\n\nMaintenance agreement: paid on Jan 1, year 1, service starts March 1, year 2. So, in year 1, no service period has occurred, so no expense. The $15,000 is a prepaid asset until March 1, year 2. Then, from March 1, year 2, over the next 12 months, they would expense $15,000. But since the question is about year 1, nothing there.\n\nSoftware modification: $5,000 on Jan 1, year 1. Amortized over 5 years straight-line. So each year is $1,000. For year 1, full year's amortization, so $1,000.\n\nTotal expense: $0 + $1,000 = $1,000.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't see any other factors here. The key points are recognizing that the maintenance is a prepaid expense for a future period and the software modifications are capitalized and amortized. So, the answer should be $1,000."
