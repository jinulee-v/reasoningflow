        "question": "A 44-year-old man comes to the office because of a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He says the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. He has not had shortness of breath. Medical history is unremarkable. He takes no medications other than the ibuprofen for pain. Vital signs are temperature 37.4\u00b0C (99.4\u00b0F), pulse 88/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 120/84 mm Hg. Examination of the nares shows erythematous mucous membranes. Examination of the throat shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia on the posterior oropharynx. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
        "response": "Okay, let's see. The patient is a 44-year-old man with a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. The headache is worse in the morning and gets better with ibuprofen. He doesn't have shortness of breath. His vitals are mostly normal except for a slight fever of 37.4\u00b0C. On exam, his nares are red, throat is erythematous with follicular lymphoid hyperplasia, no swollen neck lymph nodes, and lungs are clear.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out what's causing these symptoms. The main symptoms are upper respiratory: sore throat, runny nose, cough, headache. The headache is frontal and worse in the morning. The fact that it's better with ibuprofen suggests it might be inflammatory, maybe sinus-related? Since frontal sinuses are in the forehead area, a frontal headache could point towards sinusitis. But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nThe throat exam shows erythema and follicular lymphoid hyperplasia. Follicular hyperplasia is often seen in viral infections, like infectious mononucleosis, but he doesn't have cervical adenopathy here. Wait, mono usually has lymphadenopathy, especially posterior cervical nodes. Since there's no palpable adenopathy, maybe it's not mono. Also, the patient is 44, which is a bit older for mono, though not impossible.\n\nThe runny nose and sore throat could be a common cold. But the headache's timing (worse in the morning) and the fact that it's frontal makes me think of sinusitis. Acute sinusitis often presents with purulent nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure, worse in the morning, maybe fever. But here, the discharge is described as runny, not necessarily purulent. However, sometimes early sinusitis might have clear discharge before it becomes purulent. Also, the cough is nonproductive, which is more common in upper respiratory infections rather than lower (like bronchitis). Since the lungs are clear, that's more supportive of an upper issue.\n\nAnother thought: could this be influenza? But he doesn't have high fever (only 37.4), and influenza usually has more systemic symptoms like myalgias, which aren't mentioned here. Also, the cough is nonproductive, which can be with flu, but the headache's timing is more sinus-like.\n\nLooking at the throat exam: erythema and follicular hyperplasia. Follicular pattern is seen in viral pharyngitis, like adenovirus, or maybe even EBV (mono). But again, without adenopathy, maybe it's a viral pharyngitis. However, the presence of nasal symptoms (runny nose, congestion) along with sore throat and cough makes me think this is a common cold virus, which is usually rhinovirus, coronavirus, etc. But the headache's characteristics are pointing towards sinus involvement.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the most likely cause. Let's consider the differential:\n\n1. Viral upper respiratory infection (common cold): This is the most common cause. Symptoms include sore throat, cough, runny nose, maybe low-grade fever. Headache can occur, but the timing (worse in morning) might be more sinus-related.\n\n2. Acute bacterial sinusitis: Typically follows a viral URI. Symptoms include purulent nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure, worse in the morning, possibly fever. The headache here is described as frontal and worse in the morning, which fits. However, the nasal discharge here is just \"runny\" \u2013 maybe it's early sinusitis before it becomes purulent? Or maybe the discharge is clear but the other symptoms point towards sinusitis.\n\n3. Allergic rhinitis: Can cause similar symptoms but usually no fever. The headache might not be as prominent, and the timing might not be as morning-specific. Also, the sore throat and cough might be less common in allergies unless there's post-nasal drip.\n\n4. Influenza: As mentioned, less likely due to low fever and lack of systemic symptoms.\n\n5. Tonsillitis: Usually more severe sore throat, possible exudate, lymphadenopathy. He has follicular hyperplasia but no adenopathy, so maybe not.\n\n6. EBV (mononucleosis): As before, but no adenopathy, so less likely.\n\nSo between viral URI and sinusitis. The key points are the headache characteristics. In sinusitis, the headache is typically worse in the morning because of the horizontal position leading to increased sinus pressure. The fact that ibuprofen helps suggests it's an inflammatory process, which aligns with sinusitis. However, sinusitis usually has more nasal symptoms like purulent discharge, but maybe in early stages it's just rhinorrhea. Also, the cough is nonproductive, which can occur with sinus drainage.\n\nAlternatively, the follicular hyperplasia in the throat could be part of a viral syndrome. But the combination of symptoms points more towards sinusitis. Since the patient has a low-grade fever, that could be part of the sinus infection.\n\nWait, but the question says \"most likely cause\". In primary care, the majority of these cases are viral. Acute bacterial sinusitis is a possibility but requires certain criteria. According to guidelines, acute bacterial sinusitis is diagnosed if symptoms last more than 10 days without improvement, or worsening after initial improvement (double worsening). Since this patient has only had symptoms for 3 days, it's more likely viral. The headache could be due to sinus congestion from the viral URI.\n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is viral upper respiratory infection (common cold). But the question is trying to get us to think about sinusitis? Let me check the details again.\n\nThe headache is worse in the morning, which is classic for sinusitis. The presence of a low-grade fever could be part of the viral illness. The nasal mucosa is erythematous, which is common in both viral and bacterial sinusitis. The throat findings are follicular, which is more viral. Since the symptoms have only been present for 3 days, it's still within the timeframe of a viral URI. Bacterial sinusitis typically comes on after a viral upper respiratory infection, so maybe this is still the early phase.\n\nAlternatively, could it be influenza? But the fever is low, and the cough is nonproductive. Influenza can have nonproductive cough, but again, the timing of the headache is more sinus-related.\n\nAnother angle: the cough is nonproductive. If it were bacterial sinusitis, maybe the cough is from postnasal drip. That's possible. But again, in the first 3 days, it's more likely viral.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the most likely cause. Since the symptoms are all pointing towards an upper respiratory infection with possible sinus involvement, but given the short duration, the most likely is viral. However, the headache's characteristics might make some think of sinusitis. But in the absence of purulence and given the duration, it's still viral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's allergic rhinitis with sinus congestion? But the fever would be less likely in allergies.\n\nWait, the patient has a slight fever (37.4), which is a low-grade fever. That's more consistent with a viral infection. Allergies usually don't cause fever.\n\nSo putting it all together: the patient has a 3-day history of URI symptoms, including a frontal headache worse in the morning. The exam shows signs of upper respiratory infection (erythematous nares, pharynx with follicular hyperplasia). Since the symptoms are only 3 days, it's most likely a viral upper respiratory infection. The headache is due to sinus congestion from the viral illness. Bacterial sinusitis is less likely at this point because it usually takes longer to develop, and there's no purulence yet.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause is a viral upper respiratory infection, such as the common cold.\n</think>\n\nThe patient's symptoms and examination findings are most consistent with a **viral upper respiratory infection (common cold)**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Key Clinical Findings:\n1. **Symptoms**: \n   - 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache (worse in the morning, improved with ibuprofen).\n   - No shortness of breath or systemic symptoms like myalgias.\n   - Low-grade fever (37.4\u00b0C).\n\n2. **Physical Exam**:\n   - Erythematous nares and posterior oropharynx with **follicular lymphoid hyperplasia** (common in viral pharyngitis).\n   - No cervical lymphadenopathy or purulent nasal discharge.\n   - Clear lungs on auscultation.\n\n### Differential Considerations:\n1. **Acute Bacterial Sinusitis**:\n   - Typically follows a viral URI and presents with **purulent nasal discharge**, facial pressure/pain, and worsening symptoms after 5\u20137 days. \n   - The patient\u2019s 3-day duration, absence of purulence, and lack of facial tenderness make this less likely at this stage.\n\n2. **Influenza**:\n   - Usually presents with higher fever, myalgias, and more severe systemic symptoms. The low-grade fever and absence of myalgias make this less likely.\n\n3. **EBV/Infectious Mononucleosis**:\n   - Associated with cervical lymphadenopathy, which is absent here. Follicular hyperplasia can occur in EBV, but the short duration and lack of adenopathy make this unlikely.\n\n4. **Allergic Rhinitis**:\n   - Typically lacks fever and sore throat. The headache\u2019s timing (worse in the morning) could align with sinus congestion, but the fever and pharyngeal findings favor a viral etiology.\n\n### Why Viral Upper Respiratory Infection?\n- **Duration**: Symptoms have only been present for 3 days, which is typical for a viral URI (common cold) caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, or adenovirus.\n- **Headache**: Frontal headaches worsened in the morning are often due to sinus congestion from viral rhinitis, not yet progressing to bacterial sinusitis.\n- **Exam Findings**: Follicular hyperplasia in the oropharynx and erythematous mucous membranes are hallmark signs of viral infection.\n- **Response to Ibuprofen**: The headache\u2019s improvement with NSAIDs supports an inflammatory process (e.g., sinus congestion) rather than a tension or migraine-type headache.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms and exam are most consistent with a **viral upper respiratory infection (common cold)**. Bacterial sinusitis is unlikely given the short duration and lack of purulent signs. No further testing or antibiotics are warranted at this stage; supportive care (hydration, rest, nasal decongestants) is appropriate.\n\n**Answer:** Viral upper respiratory infection (common cold)."
