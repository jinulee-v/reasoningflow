        "question": "A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the pKa of this new monoprotic acid. Let me start by recalling what I know. The problem says it's a monoprotic acid, so it donates one proton. The molar mass is 248 g/mol, but I'm not sure if that's needed yet. The key information is that 0.0050 mol of the acid is dissolved in 0.500 L of water, and the pH is 3.89. \n\nFirst, maybe I should write down the formula for a weak acid dissociation. Since it's monoprotic, the acid (let's call it HA) will dissociate as:\n\nHA \u21cc H\u207a + A\u207b\n\nThe pH is given, so I can find the concentration of H\u207a ions. The pH is 3.89, so [H\u207a] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-3.89). Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 10^-3 is 0.001, and 10^-0.89 is... Let me think. Since 10^-0.89 is the same as 1/(10^0.89). 10^0.89 is approximately... Well, 10^0.9 is about 7.94, so 10^0.89 is maybe around 7.76? Let me check with a calculator. Wait, actually, maybe I should use a more precise method. Alternatively, since I know that log(7.76) is about 0.89, so 10^0.89 \u2248 7.76. Therefore, 10^-0.89 \u2248 1/7.76 \u2248 0.129. So 10^-3.89 \u2248 1.29 x 10^-4 M. Let me confirm that with a calculator step:\n\npH = 3.89 \u2192 [H+] = 10^(-3.89). Let me compute this more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator: 10^(-3.89) = 10^(-4 + 0.11) = 10^0.11 * 10^-4. 10^0.11 is approximately 1.288. So 1.288 x 10^-4. So approximately 1.29 x 10^-4 M. Okay, so [H+] \u2248 1.29e-4 M.\n\nSince the acid is monoprotic, the concentration of H+ should be equal to the concentration of A\u207b, right? Because each HA that dissociates gives one H+ and one A\u207b. So [H+] = [A\u207b] = 1.29e-4 M.\n\nNow, the initial concentration of the acid is 0.0050 mol in 0.500 L. Let me calculate that concentration. \n\nMolarity (M) = moles / liters = 0.0050 mol / 0.500 L = 0.010 M. So the initial concentration of HA is 0.010 M. \n\nBut when it dissociates, some of it becomes H+ and A\u207b. Let me set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).\n\nInitial:\n[HA] = 0.010 M\n[H+] = 0 (but actually, water autoionization gives 1e-7, but negligible here)\n[A\u207b] = 0\n\nChange:\n[HA] decreases by x\n[H+] increases by x\n[A\u207b] increases by x\n\nEquilibrium:\n[HA] = 0.010 - x\n[H+] = x\n[A\u207b] = x\n\nBut wait, we already found that [H+] is 1.29e-4, so x = 1.29e-4. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[HA] = 0.010 - 1.29e-4 \u2248 0.009871 M (since 1.29e-4 is much smaller than 0.010, maybe we can approximate 0.010 - x \u2248 0.010, but let's see if that's valid)\n\n[A\u207b] = 1.29e-4 M\n\n[H+] = 1.29e-4 M\n\nNow, the Ka expression is:\n\nKa = [H+][A\u207b] / [HA]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nKa = (1.29e-4)(1.29e-4) / (0.010 - 1.29e-4)\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, numerator: (1.29e-4)^2 = (1.29)^2 x 10^-8 \u2248 1.6641 x 10^-8\n\nDenominator: 0.010 - 0.000129 \u2248 0.009871\n\nSo Ka \u2248 (1.6641e-8) / 0.009871 \u2248 ?\n\nCalculating that division: 1.6641e-8 / 0.009871 \u2248 1.686e-6\n\nWait, let me do that division step by step. \n\n1.6641e-8 divided by 0.009871. Let's write both in scientific notation:\n\n1.6641e-8 / 9.871e-3 = (1.6641 / 9.871) x 10^(-8 + 3) = (0.1686) x 10^-5 = 1.686 x 10^-6\n\nSo Ka \u2248 1.686 x 10^-6\n\nTherefore, pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.686e-6)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nlog(1.686e-6) = log(1.686) + log(1e-6) \u2248 0.227 + (-6) = -5.773\n\nTherefore, pKa \u2248 5.773\n\nWait, but let me check if the approximation was valid. The initial concentration was 0.010 M, and x is 1.29e-4, which is about 1.3% of 0.010. Since 5% is usually the cutoff for approximation, 1.3% is okay, so the approximation [HA] \u2248 0.010 is valid. Therefore, the error introduced is minimal. \n\nAlternatively, if I use the exact denominator:\n\n0.009871 instead of 0.010, so let's see:\n\n1.6641e-8 / 0.009871 \u2248 1.686e-6 as before. So the approximation doesn't change much. \n\nTherefore, the pKa is approximately 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again step by step to be sure.\n\nFirst, [H+] = 10^-3.89. Let me compute that more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator: 10^-3.89. Let me use natural logs for better precision?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use logarithm tables or a calculator. Since I don't have a calculator here, but let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the exact value:\n\npH = 3.89, so [H+] = 10^-3.89. Let me compute 10^-3.89:\n\nTake log(10^-3.89) = -3.89, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I use a calculator, 10^0.89 is approximately 7.76, so 10^-0.89 is 1/7.76 \u2248 0.1289, so 10^-3.89 = 10^(-4 + 0.11) = 10^0.11 * 10^-4. Wait, 0.11? Wait, 3.89 is 3 + 0.89, so 10^-3.89 = 10^-3 * 10^-0.89 \u2248 0.001 * 0.1289 \u2248 0.0001289, so 1.289e-4. So that's correct. \n\nSo [H+] is 1.289e-4. \n\nThen, the numerator is (1.289e-4)^2 = (1.289)^2 x 10^-8. Let's compute 1.289 squared:\n\n1.289 * 1.289: 1*1 =1, 1*0.289=0.289, 0.289*1=0.289, 0.289*0.289\u22480.0835. So adding up:\n\n(1 + 0.289 + 0.289 + 0.0835) but actually, that's not the right way. Wait, actually, (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 where a=1, b=0.289. Wait, no, 1.289 is 1 + 0.289, so (1 + 0.289)^2 = 1 + 2*0.289 + 0.289\u00b2 \u2248 1 + 0.578 + 0.0835 \u2248 1.6615. So approximately 1.6615 x 10^-8. \n\nDenominator: 0.010 - 0.0001289 = 0.0098711. \n\nSo 1.6615e-8 / 0.0098711 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 1.6615 / 0.0098711 first. \n\n1.6615 divided by 0.0098711. Let's see:\n\n0.0098711 * 168 = approx 0.0098711 * 100 = 0.98711, 0.0098711 * 60 = 0.592266, 0.0098711 * 8 = 0.0789688. Adding those: 0.98711 + 0.592266 = 1.579376 + 0.0789688 \u2248 1.65834. That's very close to 1.6615. So 0.0098711 * 168 \u2248 1.65834, which is just slightly less than 1.6615. The difference is 1.6615 - 1.65834 \u2248 0.00316. \n\nSo 0.00316 / 0.0098711 \u2248 0.32. So total is approximately 168.32. \n\nTherefore, 1.6615 / 0.0098711 \u2248 168.32, so the total is 168.32 x 10^-8 / 10^0 (since denominator was 10^-3?) Wait, no, sorry, the denominator was 0.0098711 which is 9.8711e-3. Wait, actually, the division is (1.6615e-8) / (9.8711e-3) = (1.6615 / 9.8711) x 10^(-8 + 3) = (0.1683) x 10^-5 = 1.683 x 10^-6. \n\nSo that gives Ka \u2248 1.683 x 10^-6. \n\nTherefore, pKa = -log(1.683e-6). \n\nCalculating log(1.683e-6):\n\nlog(1.683) + log(1e-6) = approx 0.226 + (-6) = -5.774. \n\nTherefore, pKa = 5.774. \n\nSo rounding to two decimal places, that would be 5.77. \n\nBut maybe the question expects more precise? Let me see if I can get a better approximation for log(1.683). \n\nlog(1.683): since log(1.6) = 0.2041, log(1.7)=0.2304. 1.683 is between 1.6 and 1.7. \n\nThe difference between 1.6 and 1.7 is 0.1 in the argument, and the log difference is 0.2304 - 0.2041 = 0.0263. \n\n1.683 - 1.6 = 0.083. So fraction is 0.083 / 0.1 = 0.83. \n\nTherefore, log(1.683) \u2248 0.2041 + 0.83 * 0.0263 \u2248 0.2041 + 0.0218 \u2248 0.2259. \n\nSo log(1.683e-6) = 0.2259 -6 = -5.7741, so pKa = 5.7741. \n\nSo approximately 5.77. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use more precise calculation for [H+]. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming that [H+] equals x. Wait, in the dissociation of HA, the H+ comes from the acid and also from water. But since the pH is 3.89, which is quite acidic, the contribution from water autoionization is negligible, so [H+] \u2248 x. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, if the acid is weak, but in this case, since the concentration is 0.01 M and the pH is 3.89, so the [H+] is about 1e-4, so the dissociation is small, so the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to do the exact calculation without approximating [HA] as 0.01. \n\nSo, the exact expression for Ka is:\n\nKa = (x^2) / (0.010 - x)\n\nWe know x = [H+] = 1.289e-4. \n\nSo plugging in:\n\nKa = ( (1.289e-4)^2 ) / (0.010 - 1.289e-4 )\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before, so that gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, the pKa is approximately 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check if the problem mentions anything about the molar mass. The molar mass is 248 g/mol. Hmm, why is that given? \n\nWait, maybe I need to check if the acid is diprotic or something else, but the problem says it's monoprotic. So molar mass might not be necessary here. Maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps I missed something. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem states that it's a monoprotic acid with molar mass 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol are dissolved in 0.500 L, so the concentration is 0.01 M as I calculated. \n\nWait, perhaps the molar mass is given in case we need to find the formula or something else, but since they just ask for pKa, maybe it's not needed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that [H+] = x. Let me think again. \n\nIn the dissociation HA \u21cc H+ + A\u207b, the H+ concentration is equal to x, which is the amount dissociated. However, in reality, the H+ comes from both the acid and water. But since the solution is acidic (pH 3.89), the contribution from water is negligible, so [H+] \u2248 x. \n\nAlternatively, if the acid were very weak, maybe the contribution from water would be significant, but here, since pH is 3.89, which is quite acidic, so the H+ is mostly from the acid. \n\nTherefore, the calculation should be okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation? Let me see. \n\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A\u207b]/[HA])\n\nWe can rearrange that to pKa = pH - log([A\u207b]/[HA])\n\nWe know pH is 3.89. \n\n[A\u207b] is equal to [H+] = 1.29e-4, and [HA] is 0.010 - 1.29e-4 \u2248 0.009871. \n\nTherefore, [A\u207b]/[HA] \u2248 (1.29e-4)/0.009871 \u2248 0.01307. \n\nTaking log(0.01307) = log(1.307 x 10^-2) = log(1.307) + (-2). \n\nlog(1.307) \u2248 0.116, so log(0.01307) \u2248 0.116 - 2 = -1.884. \n\nTherefore, pKa = 3.89 - (-1.884) = 3.89 + 1.884 = 5.774. \n\nSame result! So that confirms it. \n\nTherefore, the pKa is approximately 5.77. \n\nWait, so the molar mass is irrelevant here? The problem mentions it, so maybe I need to check if there's another approach where molar mass is needed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick us into thinking it's a diprotic acid? But it says monoprotic. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the concentration was given in grams instead of moles? Wait, no, the problem says 0.0050 mol. \n\nHmm, perhaps the molar mass is given to check if the student considers the formula weight, but since we are dealing with concentrations in terms of moles, maybe it's not needed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to calculate the degree of dissociation and then find Ka, but that's essentially what I did. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in assuming that [H+] = [A\u207b]. Let me think again. \n\nIn the dissociation HA \u21cc H+ + A\u207b, yes, each mole of HA that dissociates gives one mole of H+ and one mole of A\u207b. So [H+] = [A\u207b] = x. \n\nTherefore, that part is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution isn't dilute enough? But 0.01 M is a moderate concentration, and the dissociation is small (since x is ~0.000129, which is 1.3% of 0.01), so the approximation holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the exact expression without approximating [HA] as 0.01. Let me try that. \n\nKa = x\u00b2 / (0.01 - x) \n\nWe have x = 1.289e-4, so plugging in:\n\nKa = (1.289e-4)^2 / (0.01 - 1.289e-4) \n\nCalculates to:\n\n(1.661e-8) / (0.0098711) \u2248 1.683e-6, as before. \n\nSo pKa is still 5.77. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check with more precise calculation for log(1.683e-6). \n\nLet me recall that log(1.683e-6) = log(1.683) + log(1e-6). \n\nlog(1.683): \n\nWe can use logarithm tables or linear approximation between log(1.68) and log(1.69). \n\nlog(1.68) = ?\n\nWell, log(1.6) = 0.2041, log(1.7)=0.2304. \n\nWait, perhaps better to use natural logs and convert? \n\nAlternatively, use the Taylor series for log around 1.68? Hmm, maybe overcomplicating. \n\nAlternatively, remember that log(1.683) is approximately 0.226. Let me check with a calculator-like approach. \n\nLet me recall that 10^0.226 \u2248 10^0.2 * 10^0.026 \u2248 1.5849 * 1.062 \u2248 1.683. \n\nYes, exactly. Because 10^0.226 \u2248 1.683. Therefore, log(1.683) = 0.226. \n\nTherefore, log(1.683e-6) = 0.226 -6 = -5.774, so pKa = 5.774. \n\nSo, rounding to two decimal places, that's 5.77. \n\nAlternatively, maybe to two decimal places, it's 5.77, or three? The question doesn't specify, but in pH and pKa values, typically two decimal places are common. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer expects three decimal places. Let me see. \n\nWait, the given pH is 3.89, which is two decimal places. So maybe the answer should also be two decimal places. \n\nTherefore, 5.77. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the student is supposed to use the formula for weak acids: \n\nFor a weak acid, the pH can be calculated by:\n\n[H+] = sqrt(Ka * C)\n\nBut this is only valid when the dissociation is small, so that [HA] \u2248 C. \n\nIn that case, solving for Ka gives Ka = [H+]\u00b2 / C. \n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. \n\nSo, using that formula:\n\nKa = (1.289e-4)^2 / 0.01 \u2248 (1.66e-8)/0.01 = 1.66e-6, which gives pKa \u2248 5.78. \n\nWait, but when I used the exact denominator (0.009871), it was 1.683e-6, so pKa 5.774. \n\nThe difference comes from whether we approximate [HA] as 0.01 or use the exact value. \n\nSince the problem gives the pH, which is an exact measurement, perhaps we should use the exact value. \n\nTherefore, the precise calculation gives pKa \u2248 5.77. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the student to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation as I did earlier, which also gives the same result. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. \n\nWait, the problem says \"a new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol\". The molar mass is given, but I didn't use it. Maybe that's a trick? \n\nWait, perhaps the student is supposed to calculate the concentration using the molar mass? Wait, but the problem already gives the moles (0.0050 mol) dissolved in 0.500 L. So the concentration is 0.01 M regardless of molar mass. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in different units? Like, if they gave grams instead of moles, but no, it says 0.0050 mol. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molar mass is to check if the student considers the formula, but since it's a monoprotic acid, the formula is irrelevant for calculating pKa. \n\nTherefore, I think the molar mass is just extra information, perhaps to test if the student gets confused. \n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the pKa is approximately 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. \n\nSuppose I let x be the concentration of H+ (which is equal to [A\u207b]), then:\n\nKa = x\u00b2 / (0.01 - x)\n\nWe can plug in x = 1.289e-4, so:\n\nKa = (1.289e-4)^2 / (0.01 - 1.289e-4) \u2248 1.683e-6, so pKa is 5.774. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't approximate x as negligible compared to 0.01, but actually, since x is 0.0001289, which is 1.289% of 0.01, so the error is minimal. \n\nAlternatively, if I do the exact calculation without approximating, but since x is so small, the difference is negligible. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check with the exact formula. \n\nSuppose I don't approximate, so:\n\nKa = (x)^2 / (C - x)\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for Ka, but since we know x from the pH, we can plug in directly. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't know x, but that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the student to use the relation between pH and pKa for a weak acid. \n\nThe formula when the acid is weak and not too dilute is:\n\n[H+] = ( -Ka + sqrt(Ka\u00b2 + 4*Ka*C) ) / 2\n\nBut solving this would require knowing Ka, which is what we need to find. \n\nAlternatively, setting up the quadratic equation:\n\nKa = x\u00b2/(C - x)\n\nMultiply both sides by (C - x):\n\nKa*(C - x) = x\u00b2\n\nKa*C - Ka*x = x\u00b2\n\nx\u00b2 + Ka*x - Ka*C = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in x: x\u00b2 + Ka x - Ka*C = 0\n\nBut since we know x from the pH, we can plug in x and solve for Ka. \n\nWait, but that's exactly what I did earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't know x, but here we do know x from the pH. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is straightforward. \n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check with another method. \n\nSuppose I use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation again. \n\npH = pKa + log([A\u207b]/[HA])\n\nWe have pH = 3.89, [A\u207b] = [H+] = 1.289e-4, [HA] = 0.01 - 1.289e-4 \u2248 0.009871. \n\nTherefore, log([A\u207b]/[HA]) = log( (1.289e-4)/0.009871 ) = log(0.01306) \u2248 log(1.306 x 10^-2) = log(1.306) + log(10^-2) \u2248 0.116 - 2 = -1.884. \n\nTherefore, pKa = 3.89 - (-1.884) = 3.89 + 1.884 = 5.774. \n\nSame result. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5.77. \n\nWait, but the problem might expect the answer to be in two decimal places, so 5.77, or maybe three? Let me see. \n\nThe given pH is 3.89 (two decimal places), so the pKa should also be reported to two decimal places. \n\nTherefore, 5.77. \n\nAlternatively, if I use more precise calculation for log(1.683e-6):\n\nLet me use a calculator-like approach. \n\nlog(1.683e-6) = log(1.683) + log(1e-6). \n\nlog(1.683):\n\nWe can use logarithm properties. Let me recall that ln(1.683) \u2248 0.520, so log(1.683) = ln(1.683)/ln(10) \u2248 0.520 / 2.3026 \u2248 0.2258. \n\nTherefore, log(1.683e-6) \u2248 0.2258 -6 = -5.7742, so pKa = 5.7742, which rounds to 5.77. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check once more if I messed up any step. \n\nWait, the problem says \"monoprotic acid\", so that's correct. \n\nMolar mass given but not needed. \n\nConcentration is 0.01 M. \n\npH is 3.89, so [H+] is 1.289e-4. \n\nKa is (1.289e-4)^2 / (0.01 - 1.289e-4) \u2248 1.68e-6, so pKa \u2248 5.77. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check with another perspective. \n\nSuppose someone does the problem and forgets that [HA] is 0.01 - x, and just uses 0.01, then they get Ka = (1.289e-4)^2 / 0.01 = 1.66e-6, so pKa = 5.78. \n\nBut since the question gives the pH, which is precise, we should use the exact [HA]. \n\nTherefore, the precise answer is 5.77. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the student to use the approximation and get 5.78. \n\nHmm, but given that the difference between 5.77 and 5.78 is small, but since the exact calculation gives 5.77, I think that's better. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+]. Let me recalculate [H+] from pH 3.89. \n\npH = -log[H+], so [H+] = 10^-3.89. \n\nLet me compute 10^-3.89:\n\nFirst, 10^-3 = 0.001. \n\n10^-0.89 = ?\n\nLet me compute log(7.76) \u2248 0.89, so 10^0.89 \u2248 7.76, so 10^-0.89 \u2248 1/7.76 \u2248 0.1289. \n\nTherefore, 10^-3.89 = 10^(-3 -0.89) = 10^-3 * 10^-0.89 \u2248 0.001 * 0.1289 \u2248 0.0001289, so 1.289e-4. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, all steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5.77. \n\nWait, but let me check with another method. \n\nSuppose I let the acid be HA, then:\n\nThe concentration of HA is 0.01 M. \n\nAt equilibrium, [H+] = [A\u207b] = 1.289e-4, [HA] = 0.01 - 1.289e-4. \n\nTherefore, plugging into Ka:\n\nKa = (1.289e-4)^2 / (0.009871) \u2248 1.68e-6. \n\nTaking the negative log:\n\npKa = -log(1.68e-6) \u2248 5.775. \n\nSo, 5.78 when rounded to two decimal places? Wait, 5.775 would round to 5.78. \n\nWait, hold on. \n\nWait, 1.68e-6 is 1.68 x 10^-6. \n\nlog(1.68) is log(1.68). \n\nlog(1.68) = ?\n\nWell, log(1.6) = 0.2041, log(1.7)=0.2304. \n\n1.68 is 0.08 above 1.6. \n\nThe difference between log(1.6) and log(1.7) is 0.0263 over 0.1. \n\nSo, 0.08/0.1 = 0.8 of the interval. \n\nSo, 0.2041 + 0.8*(0.0263) = 0.2041 + 0.0210 = 0.2251. \n\nTherefore, log(1.68) \u2248 0.2251. \n\nTherefore, log(1.68e-6) = 0.2251 -6 = -5.7749. \n\nTherefore, pKa = 5.7749, which is approximately 5.77 when rounded to two decimal places. \n\nBecause the third decimal is 4, which is less than 5, so it stays 5.77. \n\nWait, 5.7749 is 5.77 when rounded to two decimal places. \n\nYes, because the third decimal is 4, so we don't round up. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 5.77. \n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe pKa of the acid is \\boxed{5.77}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the pKa of the monoprotic acid, we start by noting the given information: the acid has a molar mass of 248 g/mol, 0.0050 mol is dissolved in 0.500 L of water, and the pH is 3.89. \n\n1. **Calculate the concentration of the acid:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Concentration} = \\frac{0.0050 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.500 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.010 \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the hydrogen ion concentration [H\u207a]:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{pH} = 3.89 \\implies [\\text{H}^+] = 10^{-3.89} \\approx 1.29 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{M}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set up the equilibrium concentrations:**\n   - The acid (HA) dissociates as \\( \\text{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^+ + \\text{A}^- \\)\n   - At equilibrium, \\([\\text{H}^+] = [\\text{A}^-] = 1.29 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{M}\\)\n   - The concentration of undissociated HA is \\(0.010 - 1.29 \\times 10^{-4} \\approx 0.009871 \\, \\text{M}\\)\n\n4. **Calculate the acid dissociation constant \\(K_a\\):**\n   \\[\n   K_a = \\frac{[\\text{H}^+][\\text{A}^-]}{[\\text{HA}]} = \\frac{(1.29 \\times 10^{-4})^2}{0.009871}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   K_a \\approx \\frac{1.664 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.009871} \\approx 1.686 \\times 10^{-6}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the pKa:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{pKa} = -\\log(K_a) = -\\log(1.686 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 5.77\n   \\]\n\nThe pKa of the acid is \\boxed{5.77}."
