        "question": "Find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find all elements c in the ring Z_3 (which is the integers modulo 3) such that when we form the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 + c), the result is a field. Hmm, let me recall some algebra concepts here. \n\nFirst, I remember that for a quotient ring R/I to be a field, the ideal I must be maximal. In the case of polynomial rings over a field, like Z_3[x], an ideal generated by a polynomial f(x) is maximal if and only if f(x) is irreducible over that field. So, essentially, I need to find all c in Z_3 such that the polynomial x\u00b2 + c is irreducible over Z_3. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. Since Z_3 is a field, right? Because 3 is prime, so Z_3 is indeed a field. Therefore, the ring Z_3[x] is a principal ideal domain, so the maximal ideals are exactly those generated by irreducible polynomials. Therefore, yes, if x\u00b2 + c is irreducible over Z_3, then the quotient ring will be a field. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all c in Z_3 (so c can be 0, 1, or 2) such that x\u00b2 + c is irreducible in Z_3[x]. \n\nNow, how do I check if a quadratic polynomial is irreducible over Z_3? Well, for quadratics, a polynomial is irreducible if and only if it has no roots in the field. Since if it had a root, then it would factor into linear terms. So, for each c in Z_3, I can check whether the equation x\u00b2 + c \u2261 0 mod 3 has any solutions. If there are no solutions, then the polynomial is irreducible, and hence the quotient ring is a field. \n\nAlternatively, since the polynomial is degree 2, if it factors, it would factor into two linear terms, which would mean it has a root. So, yes, checking for roots is sufficient here. \n\nSo let me list the possible values of c: 0, 1, 2. Let me check each one.\n\nFirst, c = 0: The polynomial is x\u00b2. Well, x\u00b2 factors as x*x, so it's definitely reducible. Therefore, Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2) is not a field. So c=0 is out.\n\nNext, c = 1: The polynomial is x\u00b2 + 1. Let's check if this has any roots in Z_3. The elements of Z_3 are 0, 1, 2. Let's plug them in:\n\nFor x=0: 0\u00b2 + 1 = 1 \u2260 0 mod 3.\n\nFor x=1: 1 + 1 = 2 \u2260 0 mod 3.\n\nFor x=2: (2)^2 +1 = 4 +1 = 5 \u2261 2 mod 3 \u2260 0.\n\nSo none of the elements in Z_3 are roots of x\u00b2 +1. Therefore, x\u00b2 +1 is irreducible over Z_3. Therefore, the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 +1) is a field. So c=1 is a candidate.\n\nNow, c = 2: The polynomial is x\u00b2 + 2. Let's check for roots again.\n\nx=0: 0 + 2 = 2 \u2260 0 mod 3.\n\nx=1: 1 + 2 = 3 \u2261 0 mod 3. Oh, so x=1 is a root. Therefore, x\u00b2 +2 factors as (x -1)(x +1) in Z_3[x]? Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, if x=1 is a root, then (x -1) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or factorization.\n\nLet me see: x\u00b2 +2 divided by (x -1). Let me do the division.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that if (x - a) is a factor, then the other factor would be (x - b), such that a + b is the coefficient of x (with a sign change) and a*b is the constant term. But in x\u00b2 + 2, the coefficient of x is 0, so a + b = 0, and a*b = 2. \n\nSo, solving a + b =0 and a*b =2 in Z_3. Since a + b =0 implies b = -a. Then, a*(-a) = -a\u00b2 =2 mod 3. So -a\u00b2 \u22612 mod3 \u21d2 a\u00b2 \u2261 -2 mod3 \u21d2 a\u00b2 \u22611 mod3 (since -2 mod3 is 1). \n\nSo a\u00b2 \u22611 mod3. The solutions to this are a=1 and a=2 (since 1\u00b2=1 and 2\u00b2=4\u22611 mod3). Let's check with a=1: then b = -1 \u22612 mod3. So (x -1)(x -2) = x\u00b2 -3x +2 \u2261x\u00b2 +0x +2 mod3, which is x\u00b2 +2. Perfect. So indeed, x\u00b2 +2 factors as (x -1)(x -2) in Z_3[x]. Therefore, it is reducible, so the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 +2) is not a field. \n\nTherefore, c=2 is out. \n\nSo the only c in Z_3 for which Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 +c) is a field is c=1. \n\nWait, but let me double-check everything to be sure. \n\nFirst, for c=1, x\u00b2 +1 has no roots, so it's irreducible. Therefore, the ideal (x\u00b2 +1) is maximal, so the quotient is a field. That's solid. \n\nFor c=0, as I said, x\u00b2 is reducible, so the quotient ring is not a field. \n\nFor c=2, since x=1 is a root, so it factors, hence reducible, so the ideal is not maximal, so the quotient ring is not a field. \n\nTherefore, the only c is 1. \n\nBut hold on, let me think again. Wait, in Z_3, when I checked x=2 for c=2, x=2 gives (2)^2 +2 =4 +2=6\u22610 mod3? Wait, hold on, 2 squared is 4, plus 2 is 6, which is 0 mod3. Wait, so x=2 is also a root. So actually, both x=1 and x=2 are roots of x\u00b2 +2. Therefore, the polynomial factors into (x -1)(x -2). \n\nBut in any case, since it has roots, it's reducible. \n\nWait, but let me check x=2 for c=1 again. For c=1, x=2 gives 4 +1=5\u22612 mod3, which is not zero. So that's correct. \n\nWait, so everything checks out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of another way. Since Z_3 is a field, the polynomial x\u00b2 +c is irreducible if and only if it has no roots. Since it's quadratic, that's the only way it can factor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that over a finite field, a polynomial of degree n splits into linear factors if it has a root? Hmm, not exactly, but for quadratics, if it has a root, then it factors into linear terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recall that in Z_3, the squares are 0\u00b2=0, 1\u00b2=1, 2\u00b2=4\u22611 mod3. So the squares in Z_3 are 0 and 1. Therefore, the equation x\u00b2 \u2261 -c mod3 must have no solutions. \n\nTherefore, for x\u00b2 +c to be irreducible, -c must not be a square in Z_3. Since squares are 0 and 1, so -c must not be 0 or 1 mod3. \n\nWait, let me see. Let me rephrase: x\u00b2 +c is irreducible iff the equation x\u00b2 \u2261 -c mod3 has no solutions. \n\nTherefore, -c must not be a quadratic residue mod3. The quadratic residues mod3 are 0 and 1. Therefore, -c must not be in {0,1}. \n\nSo, -c \u2261 2 mod3. Because if -c is 2 mod3, then it's not a quadratic residue. \n\nTherefore, -c \u22612 mod3 \u21d2 c \u2261 -2 \u22611 mod3. \n\nTherefore, c must be 1 mod3. \n\nTherefore, c=1 is the only solution. \n\nThat's another way to see it. \n\nTherefore, that confirms the previous conclusion. \n\nTherefore, the answer is c=1. \n\nWait, but let me check again with c=1. Then -c = -1 \u22612 mod3, which is not a quadratic residue, so indeed, x\u00b2 +1 is irreducible. \n\nSimilarly, for c=2, -c =-2\u22611 mod3, which is a quadratic residue, so x\u00b2 +2 factors. \n\nFor c=0, -c=0, which is a quadratic residue, so x\u00b2 factors. \n\nTherefore, that's another way to see it. \n\nTherefore, the only c is 1. \n\nTherefore, the answer is c=1. \n\nHmm, so I think that's solid. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me also consider the structure of the quotient ring when c=1. \n\nIf we take Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2 +1), then this ring would have elements of the form a + bx + (x\u00b2 +1), where a and b are in Z_3. Since x\u00b2 \u2261 -1 mod (x\u00b2 +1), so x\u00b2 = -1. Therefore, every element can be written as a + bx, with a, b in Z_3, and multiplication is done modulo x\u00b2 +1. \n\nSince the polynomial is irreducible, the quotient ring is a field extension of Z_3 of degree 2, so it's a field with 9 elements. \n\nTherefore, that's consistent with it being a field. \n\nAlternatively, if c=2, then the quotient ring would have zero divisors, since x -1 and x -2 are zero divisors (their product is x\u00b2 +2, which is 0 in the quotient ring). Therefore, the ring is not a domain, hence not a field. \n\nSimilarly, for c=0, the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x\u00b2) has zero divisors, like x and x, since x * x =x\u00b2 \u22610. So that's not a field either. \n\nTherefore, all checks out. \n\nTherefore, the only c in Z_3 is 1. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( c \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) such that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^2 + c) \\) is a field is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo determine all \\( c \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) such that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^2 + c) \\) is a field, we need to check when the polynomial \\( x^2 + c \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).
