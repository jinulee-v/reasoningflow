        "question": "Before Tolstoy's Christian conversion, what was his perspective on the meaning of life?",
        "response": "Before Tolstoy's Christian conversion, his perspective on the meaning of life was influenced by his experiences and the philosophical ideas of his time. He was initially drawn to the ideas of rationalism and materialism, which emphasized the importance of reason and empirical evidence in understanding the world. However, he later became disillusioned with these ideas and began to explore other philosophical and religious traditions, including Buddhism and Christianity. Tolstoy's search for meaning ultimately led him to a more spiritual and ethical perspective on life, which emphasized the importance of compassion, love, and service to others."
