        "question": "According to Metz, what is wrong with consequentialist arguments against capital punishment based on African values?",
        "response": "In his analysis, Metz critiques consequentialist arguments against capital punishment that are based on African values by highlighting their limitations and potential misalignment with deeper African philosophical principles. Metz argues that such arguments often focus narrowly on the outcomes or consequences of capital punishment, such as its deterrent effect or its impact on societal harmony, without adequately engaging with the intrinsic moral values that underpin African ethical thought.\n\nMetz suggests that African moral philosophy, particularly the concept of *ubuntu* (often summarized as \"I am because we are\"), emphasizes relationality, community, and the inherent dignity of individuals. A purely consequentialist approach, which evaluates actions based on their outcomes, may fail to capture these deeper ethical commitments. For example, even if capital punishment were shown to deter crime effectively, it might still be morally objectionable from an African perspective if it violates the dignity of the individual or disrupts communal harmony in a way that is not accounted for by a utilitarian calculus.\n\nMetz also points out that consequentialist arguments can be overly simplistic or culturally insensitive when applied to African contexts. They may ignore the complex social, historical, and cultural factors that shape attitudes toward justice and punishment in African societies. By focusing solely on outcomes, such arguments risk overlooking the importance of restorative justice, reconciliation, and the restoration of relationships, which are often central to African approaches to wrongdoing.\n\nIn summary, Metz argues that consequentialist arguments against capital punishment based on African values are inadequate because they fail to fully engage with the relational and communal dimensions of African ethics. A more robust critique of capital punishment from an African perspective would need to incorporate these deeper moral principles rather than relying solely on consequentialist reasoning."
