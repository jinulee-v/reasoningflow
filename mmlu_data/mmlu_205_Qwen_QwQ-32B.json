        "question": "How many axles does a standard automobile have?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many axles a standard automobile has. Let me start by recalling what an axle is. From what I remember, an axle is a central shaft for a wheel or a pair of wheels. It's the part that connects the wheels and allows them to rotate. Now, most cars have four wheels, right? So maybe the number of axles relates to how those wheels are arranged.\n\nWait, but an axle can have more than one wheel, right? Like in trucks, sometimes they have dual wheels on an axle. But for a standard car, I think each axle connects two wheels. So front axle and rear axle. Let me think. The front wheels are connected by the front axle, and the rear wheels by the rear axle. That would make two axles total. But maybe some cars have more? Like SUVs or trucks? But the question specifies a standard automobile, so probably a regular car, not a truck or SUV.\n\nHold on, maybe I should clarify. In automotive terms, an axle can refer to the physical shaft, but sometimes people also refer to the axle assembly as part of the drivetrain. So front-wheel drive cars have the front axle driving the wheels, and the rear might be a dead axle. But regardless of whether it's driven or not, each pair of wheels on the same axle counts as one axle. So even if the rear is just supporting, it's still an axle.\n\nLet me check some examples. A typical sedan has four wheels: two in front, two in back. So front axle and rear axle. That's two axles. What about a pickup truck? They might have a third axle for more wheels, but that's not standard. So the standard car, like a family sedan or a hatchback, would have two axles. \n\nWait, but maybe some cars have independent suspension where each wheel has its own axle? Hmm, no, I think even with independent suspension, the term axle still refers to the pair. Like in independent suspension, each wheel's spindle is connected to the car independently, but they're still considered part of the same axle assembly. So the count remains two axles.\n\nAnother angle: the term \"axle\" in vehicle specifications. For instance, when they talk about 4x2 or 4x4 vehicles. The second number is the number of driven wheels. A 4x2 has two driven wheels, either front or rear, but the total axles are still two. A 4x4 has four driven wheels, meaning both axles are driven. So regardless of drive configuration, the number of axles is two for a four-wheeled car.\n\nSo putting it all together, a standard automobile with four wheels has two axles. Front and rear. Therefore, the answer should be two. But let me make sure there's no exception. Maybe some cars have more? Like a dune buggy might have three wheels, so one axle for two wheels and a single wheel on the back, but that's not standard. The question is about standard, so four wheels, two axles. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nA standard automobile typically has **two axles**. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- **Front Axle**: Connects the two front wheels.\n- **Rear Axle**: Connects the two rear wheels.\n\nEven in vehicles with independent suspension or different drivetrain configurations (e.g., front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive), the term \"axle\" still refers to the structural component linking pairs of wheels. Since most standard cars have four wheels, they inherently have two axles. Exceptions like trucks or specialty vehicles with more wheels (and thus additional axles) are not considered \"standard\" in this context. \n\n**Answer:** A standard automobile has **2 axles**."
