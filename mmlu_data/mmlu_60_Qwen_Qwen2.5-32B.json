        "question": "Compared with the mass of a uranium atom undergoing fission, the combined masses of the products after fission are",
        "response": "The combined masses of the products after fission are less than the mass of the uranium atom before fission. This difference in mass is converted into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2. The energy released during fission is what makes nuclear power possible."
