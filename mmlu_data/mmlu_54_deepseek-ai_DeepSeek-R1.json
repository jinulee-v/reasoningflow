        "question": "The muon decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out why a muon can't decay into just an electron and a single neutrino. The question says it's because of a conservation law. Let me start by recalling what conservation laws are important in particle physics. There's conservation of energy, momentum, charge, angular momentum, and maybe some others like lepton number or baryon number. \n\nFirst, let's check the basic ones. The muon has a charge of -1, right? If it decays into an electron and a neutrino, let's see. The electron has a charge of -1, and neutrinos are neutral. So charge is conserved here: -1 becomes -1 + 0. That works. So charge conservation isn't the issue.\n\nNext, energy and momentum. Well, those are always conserved in any decay, but the problem here is that the decay isn't happening because of some other law, not energy or momentum. So maybe it's not those. \n\nWhat about lepton numbers? There are different types of leptons: electrons, muons, taus, and their neutrinos. Each has their own lepton number. So for the muon decay, the muon has a muon lepton number of +1. When it decays, the products should conserve the lepton numbers. \n\nIn the allowed decay, the muon decays into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. Let's check the lepton numbers. The electron has an electron lepton number of +1, the muon neutrino has a muon lepton number of +1, and the electron antineutrino has an electron lepton number of -1. So adding those up: for electron lepton number, +1 (electron) + (-1) (electron antineutrino) = 0. For muon lepton number, the original muon had +1, and the decay products have +1 from the muon neutrino. So both lepton numbers are conserved. \n\nBut if the muon were to decay into just an electron and a single neutrino, let's say a muon neutrino, then the electron has electron lepton number +1, and the muon neutrino has muon lepton number +1. The original muon had muon lepton number +1. So total muon lepton number is conserved, but electron lepton number would be +1, which wasn't present before. So that violates conservation of electron lepton number. \n\nAlternatively, if the single neutrino were an electron neutrino, then the electron has electron lepton number +1, and the electron neutrino also has electron lepton number +1. So total electron lepton number would be +2, which wasn't there before. The original muon had electron lepton number 0. So that's a problem. \n\nWait, but maybe the neutrino is an antineutrino? If the muon decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino, then electron lepton number would be +1 (electron) + (-1) (antineutrino) = 0. But the muon lepton number was +1 originally, and in the decay products, there's no muon lepton number. So that would violate muon lepton number conservation. \n\nSo regardless of whether the single neutrino is a muon or electron type, you can't conserve both lepton numbers. The original muon has muon lepton number +1 and electron lepton number 0. If you produce an electron, which has electron lepton number +1, you need something with electron lepton number -1 to cancel it out, which would be an electron antineutrino. But then you also need to account for the muon lepton number. The original muon's +1 muon lepton number has to be carried away by a muon neutrino. So in the standard decay, you have both a muon neutrino (carrying +1 muon lepton number) and an electron antineutrino (carrying -1 electron lepton number), which allows both lepton numbers to be conserved. \n\nIf you only have one neutrino, you can't balance both lepton numbers. Either you have an excess in electron lepton number or a deficit in muon lepton number. Therefore, the decay is forbidden by the conservation of lepton number, specifically the separate conservation of electron and muon lepton numbers. \n\nWait, but I remember that in the Standard Model, lepton numbers are actually not conserved separately in some cases, like in neutrino oscillations. But maybe in decays, the separate lepton numbers are conserved? Or is it that in the Standard Model, the charged current interactions only allow creation of a neutrino paired with its corresponding lepton? \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it's conservation of lepton family number. Each lepton family (electron, muon, tau) has their own lepton number, and in interactions, these must be conserved. So in the decay of a muon, which is a member of the muon family, you have to conserve each family's lepton number. \n\nSo when the muon decays, it produces a muon neutrino (same family) and then the electron and electron antineutrino. The electron is in the electron family, so to balance the electron lepton number, you need an electron antineutrino. Similarly, the muon's muon lepton number is carried away by the muon neutrino. \n\nIf you tried to have only one neutrino, you can't balance both. For example, if you have an electron and a muon neutrino, then electron lepton number is +1 (from electron) and muon lepton number is +1 (from neutrino). But the original muon had muon lepton number +1 and electron lepton number 0. So electron lepton number is not conserved. \n\nAlternatively, if you have an electron and an electron antineutrino, then electron lepton number is 0, but muon lepton number is 0 (since neither the electron nor the antineutrino have muon lepton number), but the original muon had muon lepton number +1. So that's not conserved either. \n\nTherefore, the decay into just an electron and a single neutrino (of any type) would violate conservation of either electron or muon lepton numbers. Hence, the law that forbids this decay is the conservation of lepton family numbers, or more specifically, the conservation of electron and muon lepton numbers individually. \n\nBut wait, I've heard that in the Standard Model, neutrinos have mass and mix, so the individual lepton numbers aren't strictly conserved. However, in the case of muon decay, the process is mediated by the weak force, which does respect lepton family numbers in the interaction vertices. So even though neutrinos can oscillate, the interactions themselves must conserve the lepton numbers. \n\nTherefore, the muon decay must emit a muon neutrino to conserve muon lepton number, and an electron antineutrino to cancel the electron lepton number from the electron. Hence, two neutrinos are needed. If there was only one neutrino, you can't satisfy both conservation laws. \n\nSo the answer should be conservation of lepton family numbers or conservation of electron and muon lepton numbers. But maybe the question is referring to a more general law. Wait, the question says \"the law of conservation of...\" So probably the answer is lepton number, but more specifically, since the problem is that you can't have just one neutrino, maybe it's conservation of lepton number in each generation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe angular momentum? Let me check. The muon has spin 1/2. The decay products would need to have total spin 1/2. If it's an electron and a neutrino, both are spin 1/2 particles. So combining two spin 1/2 particles can give total spin 0 or 1. But maybe the combination can't give the correct spin? Wait, but in the allowed decay, there are three particles: electron, muon neutrino, and electron antineutrino. Each is spin 1/2, so total spin could be 3/2 or 1/2. But maybe the orbital angular momentum can compensate. Hmm, I'm not sure. But angular momentum conservation is probably not the reason here because even with two neutrinos, you can have the spins add up appropriately with some orbital angular momentum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's conservation of baryon number? But muons and electrons are leptons, so baryon number is zero in all cases. So that's not it. \n\nAnother possibility is the conservation of the total lepton number. Wait, in the allowed decay, the total lepton number would be: electron (lepton number +1), muon neutrino (+1), and electron antineutrino (-1). So total lepton number is +1. But the original muon has lepton number +1. So total lepton number is conserved. If the decay was into electron and a single neutrino, say a muon neutrino, then total lepton number would be +1 (electron) +1 (muon neutrino) = +2, which doesn't match the original +1. If the neutrino was an antineutrino, say electron antineutrino, then total lepton number would be +1 (electron) + (-1) (electron antineutrino) = 0, which doesn't match the original +1. So in either case, total lepton number isn't conserved. \n\nWait, but in the standard decay, total lepton number is conserved as +1. If you have an electron (lepton number +1), muon neutrino (+1), and electron antineutrino (-1), total is +1. So total lepton number is conserved. But if you have only an electron and a neutrino, then total lepton number would be either +2 (if neutrino is a muon neutrino) or 0 (if neutrino is an electron antineutrino). Neither of which equals +1. Therefore, even total lepton number isn't conserved in the hypothetical decay into electron and one neutrino. \n\nBut wait, the original muon has a total lepton number of +1. So if the decay products have total lepton number +1, that's okay. But if you have an electron (lepton number +1) and a neutrino (which could be a muon neutrino, lepton number +1), total is +2. Not conserved. If neutrino is an antineutrino (lepton number -1), then total is 0. Also not conserved. So regardless, total lepton number isn't conserved. \n\nBut in the standard decay, total lepton number is conserved. So the decay into electron and one neutrino would violate total lepton number conservation. But wait, the question says the decay is forbidden by conservation of something. So maybe the answer is conservation of total lepton number? But wait, in the standard decay, total lepton number is conserved. But in the decay into electron and one neutrino, total lepton number isn't conserved. So that's a possible answer. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that individual lepton numbers (electron and muon) are the reason. But total lepton number is also a thing. However, in the standard model, total lepton number is not strictly conserved if neutrinos are Majorana particles, but in the Standard Model with Dirac neutrinos, it is conserved. However, the muon decay as per the question is allowed, and in that case, total lepton number is conserved. \n\nBut if the decay into electron and one neutrino violates total lepton number, then that's the reason. But let's check. Original muon: total lepton number +1. Decay into electron (lepton +1) and, say, muon neutrino (lepton +1). Total is +2. Not conserved. If decay into electron (lepton +1) and electron antineutrino (lepton -1), total is 0. Not conserved. So either way, total lepton number isn't conserved. Therefore, the decay is forbidden by conservation of total lepton number. \n\nBut wait, but in the standard decay, total lepton number is conserved. So why is that? Because the standard decay has an electron (lepton +1), muon neutrino (lepton +1), and electron antineutrino (lepton -1). Total lepton number: +1 +1 -1 = +1, which matches the original muon's lepton number. So total lepton number is conserved. \n\nTherefore, if the decay were to produce only an electron and a single neutrino, total lepton number wouldn't be conserved. Hence, the law is conservation of total lepton number. \n\nBut earlier, I thought it was conservation of individual lepton numbers. Which is correct? \n\nWait, let's see. If the decay produced an electron and a muon antineutrino, then total lepton number would be +1 (electron) + (-1) (muon antineutrino) = 0. Not conserved. If it's electron and muon neutrino, total is +2. Not conserved. If it's electron and electron neutrino, total is +2. Not conserved. If it's electron and electron antineutrino, total is 0. Not conserved. So regardless, total lepton number isn't conserved. \n\nTherefore, the decay into electron and one neutrino violates conservation of total lepton number. However, in the standard decay, total lepton number is conserved. So maybe the answer is conservation of lepton number. \n\nBut wait, another angle: in the standard decay, the muon converts into a muon neutrino, and the electron and electron antineutrino are created. So maybe it's about weak isospin or something else? Probably not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's conservation of family lepton numbers. For example, the muon has a muon lepton number of +1. When it decays, the muon lepton number must be conserved. So if it decays into a muon neutrino (+1), then that's conserved. But then the electron has an electron lepton number of +1, which wasn't there before, so you need an electron antineutrino (-1) to cancel that. Hence, conservation of electron lepton number. \n\nTherefore, both muon and electron lepton numbers are conserved separately. So the decay into electron and a single neutrino would violate either muon or electron lepton number conservation. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"the law of conservation of...\", so which one is it? The options could be \"lepton number\" or \"electron lepton number\" or \"muon lepton number\". But since both are violated in different ways depending on the neutrino, maybe the answer is that each lepton number must be conserved. However, the question might be expecting the answer \"lepton number\" in general, but given that total lepton number is conserved in the standard decay, but not in the hypothetical one, but also individual lepton numbers are conserved. \n\nWait, in the hypothetical decay into electron and one neutrino, if the neutrino is a muon neutrino, then total lepton number is +2 (violation), and electron lepton number is +1 (violation). If the neutrino is an electron antineutrino, total lepton number is 0 (violation), and muon lepton number is 0 (violation). So in either case, both total and individual lepton numbers are violated. \n\nBut in the standard decay, total lepton number is conserved, and individual lepton numbers are also conserved. So which conservation law is the reason? \n\nThe question is from a textbook or similar, so likely the answer they expect is conservation of lepton number, referring to the individual lepton numbers (electron and muon separately). Because historically, before the understanding of neutrino oscillations, it was thought that each lepton number was conserved separately. So the decay into an electron and a single neutrino would violate either electron or muon lepton number conservation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is conservation of lepton number, but more precisely, conservation of electron and muon lepton numbers. However, the question might just say \"lepton number\" if it's considering each generation's lepton number separately. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is angular momentum? Let me think again. The muon has spin 1/2. If it decays into two particles, electron and neutrino, each spin 1/2. The total spin could be 0 or 1. But the original spin is 1/2. So unless there's orbital angular momentum, the spins can't add up. But in three-body decay, there's more flexibility with angular momentum because the three particles can have orbital angular momentum. In two-body decay, it's harder to balance angular momentum. However, I think angular momentum can be conserved with the spins and orbital angular momentum. So maybe that's not the reason. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the conservation of the weak isospin? Probably not. \n\nAnother thought: the decay of the muon is a charged current interaction, which in the Standard Model, involves the emission of a W- boson. The muon converts into a muon neutrino via the W- boson, which then decays into an electron and electron antineutrino. So the interaction requires both the muon neutrino and the electron antineutrino. Therefore, the decay must produce both a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino to mediate the interaction. Hence, producing only one neutrino would not fulfill the requirements of the weak interaction. \n\nBut this is more about the mechanism rather than the conservation law. The question is asking for the law that forbids it, not the mechanism. \n\nSo going back, the most straightforward answer is that the decay is forbidden by the conservation of lepton number, either total or individual. Since in the decay into electron and one neutrino, total lepton number is not conserved (either +2 or 0 instead of +1), and individual lepton numbers (electron and muon) are also not conserved. \n\nBut which one is the primary reason? In the standard decay, both total and individual lepton numbers are conserved. However, if the question is from an older textbook, it might refer to the separate conservation of electron and muon lepton numbers. In more modern contexts, since total lepton number isn't strictly conserved (due to neutrino oscillations and Majorana masses), but in the context of the Standard Model with massless neutrinos, both total and individual are conserved. \n\nBut given that the decay into electron and one neutrino violates both total and individual lepton numbers, but the question is likely looking for the separate conservation of lepton numbers for each family. Therefore, the answer is conservation of lepton number, with the understanding that each lepton type (electron, muon) must have their lepton numbers conserved. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be \"conservation of lepton family number\" or \"conservation of electron and muon lepton numbers\". But the exact phrasing might vary. \n\nLooking up similar questions, typically the answer given is conservation of lepton number, referring to the separate conservation for each generation. So the muon decay must conserve both muon and electron lepton numbers, hence requiring two neutrinos. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the conservation of lepton number, specifically the separate conservation of electron and muon lepton numbers. But since the question says \"the law of conservation of...\", the answer is likely \"lepton number\" or \"lepton family number\". \n\nBut to confirm, let's think again. If only one neutrino is emitted, say a muon neutrino, then muon lepton number is conserved (1 from muon neutrino), but electron lepton number isn't (electron has +1, original was 0). If the neutrino is an electron antineutrino, then electron lepton number is conserved (electron +1 and antineutrino -1), but muon lepton number isn't (original was +1, decay products have 0). Therefore, either way, one of the lepton numbers isn't conserved. Hence, the decay is forbidden by conservation of lepton number (per family). \n\nSo the answer is conservation of lepton number, with the understanding that each lepton type's number must be conserved. However, the question might expect the answer \"lepton number\", but sometimes this is specified as \"conservation of lepton family number\" or \"separate conservation of electron and muon numbers\". \n\nBut given the way the question is phrased, the answer is probably \"lepton number\". But to be precise, since the problem arises because you can't conserve both electron and muon lepton numbers with only one neutrino, the answer is conservation of lepton number. \n\nAlternatively, some sources might phrase this as conservation of \"electron lepton number\" and \"muon lepton number\" separately. But since the question asks for \"the law\", singular, it's likely referring to the conservation of lepton number in general, considering each family. \n\nBut I need to check standard answers to similar questions. For example, in the decay of a muon, the reason it can't decay into an electron and a photon is conservation of lepton number. Similarly, here, decaying into an electron and one neutrino would violate lepton number conservation. \n\nWait, but in the case of electron and photon, photon doesn't carry lepton number, so the electron would have lepton number +1, but the original muon had +1 muon lepton number. So that's a different violation. \n\nIn our case, the problem is that with one neutrino, you can't balance both electron and muon lepton numbers. So the answer is that the decay is forbidden by conservation of lepton number, which includes conservation of each individual lepton family number. \n\nTherefore, the answer is conservation of lepton number. But to be more precise, maybe \"conservation of lepton family number\" or \"conservation of electron and muon lepton numbers\". However, given that the question is likely expecting the answer from the standard conservation laws taught in introductory particle physics, the answer is \"lepton number\". \n\nBut wait, another angle: the decay into an electron and a single neutrino would have to involve a neutrino that is both a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino, which isn't possible. Therefore, you need two neutrinos to carry away the different lepton numbers. \n\nSo yes, the answer is conservation of lepton number. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe muon decay is forbidden by the law of conservation of \\boxed{lepton\\ number}."
