        "correct_answer": "By adopting the framework of human security, the limitations of the realist state-centric approach become evident. Whilst human security defines the referent object as the person or population, state-centric approaches prioritise the security of the state, de-prioritizing the pursuit of human security."

        "question": "How can we best describe the relationship between the state-centric approach and the concept of human security?",
        "response": "The state-centric approach and the concept of human security are two distinct perspectives on international relations and security. The state-centric approach focuses on the interests and security of nation-states, while the concept of human security emphasizes the protection and well-being of individuals. The relationship between these two perspectives can be described as complementary, as both aim to ensure security and stability, but from different angles. The state-centric approach prioritizes the security of the state, while human security prioritizes the security of individuals. Both perspectives are important in understanding and addressing global security challenges."
