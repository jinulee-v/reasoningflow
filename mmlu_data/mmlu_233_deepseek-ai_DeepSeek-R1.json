        "question": "Recent research on hominid species dating from the Middle Pliocene indicates there was (as of 2020):",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what recent research from 2020 says about hominid species during the Middle Pliocene. Let me start by recalling some basics. The Pliocene epoch is part of the Neogene period, right? The Middle Pliocene would be around 3 to 3.6 million years ago. Hominids refer to the family Hominidae, which includes humans and their ancestors. \n\nI remember that Australopithecus species were around during the Pliocene. The famous one is Australopithecus afarensis, like the Lucy specimen. But there's also Australopithecus africanus, though I think that's a bit later. Then there's Paranthropus, but those might be more recent, maybe early Pleistocene. Wait, Paranthropus is part of the robust australopithecines. \n\nIn 2020, were there any new discoveries? I think there was something about a new species in Ethiopia, maybe Australopithecus anamensis? Or was that earlier? Wait, no, in 2019, there was a study about a skull from A. anamensis, which is older, around 3.8 million years. But maybe in 2020, there were more findings related to that. \n\nAlso, there's the issue of the genus Homo. Did Homo habilis exist in the Middle Pliocene? Wait, Homo habilis is usually dated to around 2.4 million years ago, which is the end of the Pliocene or start of the Pleistocene. So Middle Pliocene would be before that. So maybe Homo wasn't around yet. \n\nAnother point is the diversity of hominids. There's a hypothesis that multiple hominid species coexisted. For example, Australopithecus afarensis and Kenyanthropus platyops. But Kenyanthropus is from around 3.5 million years ago, which is Middle Pliocene. So maybe in 2020, research pointed to more diversity in that time period. \n\nWait, in 2020, there was a study about the site in Ethiopia called Woranso-Mille. They found a skull named MRD, which was attributed to Australopithecus anamensis. But that was in 2019. Maybe in 2020, there were follow-up studies discussing the implications. The MRD skull showed that A. anamensis and A. afarensis might have overlapped in time, suggesting a more complex evolutionary tree rather than a linear progression. \n\nAlso, there's the issue of bipedalism. Middle Pliocene hominids were definitely bipedal, but maybe there were different adaptations. For example, some species might have spent more time in trees. \n\nAnother area could be the environment. Research might link hominid diversity to environmental changes during the Middle Pliocene, like climate shifts leading to varied habitats that supported different species. \n\nWait, I should check if there were any specific publications in 2020. For example, a paper in Nature or Science. Let me think. In 2020, a study came out about the footprints in Tanzania, but those are from Laetoli and are around 3.66 million years old, attributed to A. afarensis. That's Middle Pliocene. The study might discuss the gait and group behavior, showing that they walked similarly to humans and maybe lived in groups. \n\nAlso, genetic studies? Well, for such old hominids, ancient DNA is unlikely, but maybe some protein analyses? Not sure. \n\nAnother angle is the use of tools. The earliest stone tools are around 3.3 million years ago, from Lomekwi in Kenya. That's towards the end of the Middle Pliocene. So maybe research in 2020 discussed the origins of tool use in this period. \n\nWait, but the Lomekwi tools are dated to about 3.3 million years ago, which is within the Middle Pliocene. So if there's 2020 research on that, it could be about pushing back the date of tool use or understanding the species responsible. Since Homo habilis isn't that old, maybe it was Australopithecus or Kenyanthropus. \n\nAlso, there's the debate about the classification of certain fossils. For example, whether some remains should be grouped into existing species or represent new ones. \n\nSo putting this together, recent research as of 2020 on Middle Pliocene hominids might highlight: \n\n1. Greater diversity of hominid species coexisting than previously thought. \n2. Evidence of overlapping species challenging linear ancestor-descendant relationships.\n3. New fossil discoveries adding to the understanding of species like A. anamensis and their relation to A. afarensis.\n4. Insights into bipedalism and behavior through footprint evidence.\n5. Earlier use of stone tools pushing back the timeline of technological development.\n6. Environmental factors influencing hominid evolution and speciation.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not mixing up dates. The Middle Pliocene is roughly 3.3 to 3.6 million years ago. So the Laetoli footprints (3.66 Ma) and Lomekwi tools (3.3 Ma) fit here. The MRD skull (3.8 Ma) is a bit older, maybe Early Pliocene. But discussions in 2020 might still relate to Middle Pliocene context. \n\nAlso, in 2020, a study might have been published on the phylogenetic relationships using new fossils or methods. Maybe more evidence of species like Australopithecus deyiremeda from Ethiopia, which is around 3.3-3.5 million years ago, suggesting another contemporary species alongside A. afarensis. \n\nSo the key points would be diversity, coexistence, tool use, bipedalism, and environmental drivers. I should structure the answer around these points, citing specific studies or species as examples from 2020 research."
