        "question": "For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this thermodynamics question here: \"For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\" Hmm, let me think. I remember that internal energy change in an ideal gas is related to temperature change, right? And there's the first law of thermodynamics, which is \u0394U = Q - W, where \u0394U is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system. \n\nSo the question is asking when \u0394U equals Q. That would mean that the work done by the system, W, is zero. Because if W is zero, then \u0394U = Q - 0 = Q. So I need to figure out which process has no work done by the gas. \n\nNow, work done by the gas is given by W = P\u0394V, but that's only for a constant pressure process. In general, for any process, the work is the integral of P dV from initial to final volume. So if the volume doesn't change, then the work done would be zero. Because if \u0394V is zero, then the integral would be zero. So maybe the process where the volume is constant? That's an isochoric process. \n\nWait, let me confirm. In an isochoric process, the volume doesn't change, so yes, the gas doesn't expand or contract, so it doesn't do any work. Therefore, all the heat added goes into the internal energy. So in that case, \u0394U = Q. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another process where work done is zero? Like if the pressure is zero? But that doesn't make much sense. Or maybe an adiabatic process? Wait, no, adiabatic means Q=0, so then \u0394U would equal -W. But the question is when \u0394U equals Q, so adiabatic is the opposite. \n\nAnother thought: for an isothermal process, temperature is constant, so \u0394U should be zero (since internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature). So in that case, Q would equal W. But the question is when \u0394U equals Q, so that's not it. \n\nIsothermal is when temp is constant, so \u0394U = 0, so Q = W. \n\nIsochoric is when volume is constant, so W = 0, so \u0394U = Q. \n\nIsobaric is constant pressure, so work is P\u0394V, so \u0394U = Q - P\u0394V. \n\nIsothermal again, as above. \n\nSo the answer should be isochoric process. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The question says \"the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas\". So yes, that's exactly the case when no work is done, so isochoric. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another scenario? For example, if the process is done in such a way that the work done on the gas equals the heat added? Wait, no, the first law is \u0394U = Q - W. So if the work done BY the gas is zero, then \u0394U = Q. \n\nAlternatively, if the work done ON the gas is positive, but that's a different sign convention. Wait, sometimes work done ON the system is considered positive, so then the formula would be \u0394U = Q + W. But I think in the standard convention, W is work done BY the system. So need to be careful here. \n\nAssuming the question uses the standard convention where W is work done by the system, then yes, when W=0, \u0394U = Q. \n\nTherefore, the process must be one where the system doesn't do any work, which is when volume is constant. \n\nSo the answer is isochoric process. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me recall the different processes:\n\n1. Isothermal: T constant. For ideal gas, \u0394U = 0, so Q = W. So heat added equals work done by the gas. Not the case here.\n\n2. Isobaric: P constant. Then, work W = P\u0394V. So \u0394U = Q - P\u0394V. So unless P\u0394V is zero, which would require \u0394V = 0, but that's isochoric. So not isobaric.\n\n3. Isochoric: V constant. Then, W = 0, so \u0394U = Q. That's exactly the case.\n\n4. Adiabatic: Q = 0, so \u0394U = -W. So internal energy change is equal to negative work done by the system. Not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct process is isochoric. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, maybe free expansion? But in free expansion, the gas expands without any pressure against, so the work done is zero, but also, since it's free expansion, no heat is exchanged (if it's adiabatic). Wait, free expansion is typically considered as a process where the gas expands into a vacuum, so no work is done (since there's no external pressure), and if it's adiabatic, then Q=0, so \u0394U = 0. So internal energy doesn't change. But in that case, even though W=0, Q is also 0, so it's not the case where \u0394U equals Q (since both are zero, technically it's true, but maybe the question is referring to a non-zero heat addition). \n\nBut the question says \"the increase in the internal energy... equal to the heat added\". So if heat is added, then in free expansion, if it's not adiabatic, but maybe... Hmm, actually free expansion is usually considered adiabatic because there's no heat transfer. So maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a process where the work done is equal to zero but heat is added. So the only way is isochoric. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is isochoric process. \n\nWait, but let me check if the question gives options. Wait, the original question says \"For which of the following thermodynamic processes...\" but the user hasn't provided the options. Wait, hold on, the user just says \"For which of the following thermodynamic processes...\" but in the problem statement, but in the initial prompt, the user hasn't listed the options. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back: The user wrote \"For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\" and that's the entire question. Since they didn't provide options, but they are asking for the answer, so I need to state the process. Since in the problem statement, the user is probably expecting me to recall that it's the isochoric process. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they had options like isothermal, isobaric, isochoric, adiabatic, and the answer is isochoric. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a standard list, so I can confirm again. \n\nYes, so in conclusion, the process where the volume is constant (isochoric) is the one where \u0394U = Q, because no work is done. So the answer is isochoric process. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe correct process is an isochoric process, so the answer is \\boxed{isochoric}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which thermodynamic process results in the increase in internal energy of an ideal gas being equal to the heat added to the gas, we use the first law of thermodynamics: \n\n\\[\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta U\\) is the change in internal energy, \\(Q\\) is the heat added to the system, and \\(W\\) is the work done by the system. For \\(\\Delta U\\) to equal \\(Q\\), the work done \\(W\\) must be zero. \n\nWork done by the gas \\(W\\) is given by the integral of pressure with respect to volume change (\\(W = \\int P \\, dV\\)). If the volume does not change (\\(\\Delta V = 0\\)), the work done \\(W\\) is zero. This occurs in an isochoric process, where the volume is constant. \n\nAnalyzing other processes:\n- **Isothermal process**: Temperature is constant, so \\(\\Delta U = 0\\), hence \\(Q = W\\).\n- **Isobaric process**: Pressure is constant, so work \\(W = P \\Delta V\\), leading to \\(\\Delta U = Q - P \\Delta V\\).\n- **Adiabatic process**: No heat is added (\\(Q = 0\\)), so \\(\\Delta U = -W\\).\n\nThus, the only process where \\(\\Delta U = Q\\) is the isochoric process, as no work is done (\\(W = 0\\)).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{isochoric}\n\\]"

For \\(\\Delta U\\) to equal \\(Q\\), the work done \\(W\\) must be zero. \n\nWork done by the gas \\(W\\) is given by the integral of pressure with respect to volume change (\\(W = \\int P \\, dV\\)). If the volume does not change (\\(\\Delta V = 0\\)), the work done \\(W\\) is zero. This occurs in an isochoric process, where the volume is constant. \n\nAnalyzing other processes:\n- **Isothermal process**: Temperature is constant, so \\(\\Delta U = 0\\), hence \\(Q = W\\).\n- **Isobaric process**: Pressure is constant, so work \\(W = P \\Delta V\\), leading to \\(\\Delta U = Q - P \\Delta V\\).\n- **Adiabatic process**: No heat is added (\\(Q = 0\\)), so \\(\\Delta U = -W\\).\n\nThus, the only process where \\(\\Delta U = Q\\) is the isochoric process, as no work is done (\\(W = 0\\)).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{isochoric}\n\\]",
