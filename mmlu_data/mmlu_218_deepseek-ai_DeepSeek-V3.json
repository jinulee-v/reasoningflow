        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | During the house's demolition, I pushed him into a wall. Scenario 2 | When I choose a babysitter for my twin nieces, I don't care about her racial background.",
        "response": "According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, **Scenario 1** involves a clearly morally wrong action. Pushing someone into a wall during a house demolition is an act of physical violence, which is generally considered unethical and harmful. It violates principles of respect for others' safety and well-being.\n\n**Scenario 2**, on the other hand, does not involve a clearly morally wrong action. Choosing a babysitter without considering racial background aligns with principles of equality and non-discrimination, which are widely supported in contemporary US moral standards. In fact, judging someone based on race would be considered morally wrong. \n\nThus, **Scenario 1** is the one where the main character does something clearly morally wrong."
