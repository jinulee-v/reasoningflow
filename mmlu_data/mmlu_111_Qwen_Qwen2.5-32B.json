        "response": "During the third stage of the demographic transition model, the birth rate begins to decline while the death rate continues to fall, leading to a lower overall population growth rate. This stage is characterized by a shift towards smaller family sizes, often due to factors such as increased access to education, particularly for women, and improved healthcare. The population growth is still positive but at a slower pace compared to the second stage."
