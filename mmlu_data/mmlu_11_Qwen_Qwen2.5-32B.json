        "question": "Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?",
        "response": "Most short-period comets come from the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system beyond Neptune's orbit. We know this because the orbits of these comets are influenced by the gravitational pull of the giant planets, particularly Jupiter. The Kuiper Belt is a reservoir of icy bodies, including comets, that can be perturbed by the planets and sent into the inner solar system, where they become visible as comets. The study of the orbits and compositions of these comets has provided evidence for their origin in the Kuiper Belt."
