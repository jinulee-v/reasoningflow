        "question": "If the government subsidizes producers in a perfectly competitive market, then",
        "response": "If the government subsidizes producers in a perfectly competitive market, then the supply curve will shift to the right, resulting in a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity. This is because the subsidy reduces the cost of production for firms, allowing them to produce more at each price level. The lower price benefits consumers, while the higher quantity benefits both consumers and producers. However, the subsidy also creates a deadweight loss, as some of the benefits of the increased production are captured by the government in the form of tax revenue."
