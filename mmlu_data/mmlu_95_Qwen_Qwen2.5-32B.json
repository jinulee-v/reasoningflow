        "question": "Which of the following is considered an acid anhydride?",
        "response": "An acid anhydride is a compound that can be formed by the removal of water from an acid. The most common type of acid anhydride is a carboxylic acid anhydride, which is formed by the removal of water from two carboxylic acid molecules. For example, acetic anhydride is formed by the removal of water from two acetic acid molecules. Other types of acid anhydrides include phosphoric acid anhydrides, sulfuric acid anhydrides, and nitric acid anhydrides. These compounds are often used as reagents in organic synthesis and can be highly reactive."
