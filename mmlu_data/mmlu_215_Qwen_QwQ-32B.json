        "question": "For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020? Scenario 1 | I really loved my newborn baby boy. Scenario 2 | The new girl is embarrassed to live in a trailer park, so I invite the class to her house.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these two scenarios has the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US standards in 2020. Let me start by looking at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1 says, \"I really loved my newborn baby boy.\" Hmm, that sounds straightforward. Loving a newborn baby is generally seen as a positive thing. Parents are expected to love their children, so this doesn't seem morally wrong at all. In fact, it's probably the opposite. Unless there's some hidden context here that I'm missing, like maybe the way they're expressing love is harmful, but the statement itself just states the emotion. So I don't think Scenario 1 is the one with the moral wrongdoing.\n\nScenario 2 is, \"The new girl is embarrassed to live in a trailer park, so I invite the class to her house.\" Okay, this one is a bit more complex. Let me break it down. The new girl is embarrassed about living in a trailer park. The main character then decides to invite the entire class over to her house. Now, why would that be a problem? Well, first, the new girl is already embarrassed about her living situation. Inviting the class over might be an attempt to help her fit in, but it could also be intrusive or disrespectful. If the main character did this without the new girl's consent, that's a big issue. Invading someone's privacy or making them feel more embarrassed by exposing their living conditions to others could be considered morally wrong. \n\nWait, the scenario says \"so I invite the class to her house.\" The reasoning is because she's embarrassed, so the main character is taking action. But if the main character didn't ask the new girl first, that's a problem. The new girl might not want people to know she lives in a trailer park, and having a class over could make her feel more ashamed. It might be an attempt to be kind, but without consent, it's actually harmful. \n\nIn the US, respecting someone's privacy and their wishes is a key part of ordinary moral standards. If someone is embarrassed about their home, inviting others over without their permission would be violating their trust and could be seen as bullying or at least insensitive. So Scenario 2's action is likely the morally wrong one here.\n\nLet me double-check. Scenario 1 is just stating love for a baby, which is good. Scenario 2 involves an action that could embarrass someone further without their consent. Yeah, that seems right. The key points are consent and privacy. The main character in Scenario 2 is doing something that could harm the new girl's feelings without her agreement, which is morally wrong. So the answer should be Scenario 2.\n</think>\n\nThe main character in **Scenario 2** does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary U.S. moral standards as of 2020. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Scenario 1**:  \n\"I really loved my newborn baby boy.\"  \n- **Analysis**: Expressing love for a newborn is universally regarded as positive and morally commendable. There is no wrongdoing here.  \n\n### **Scenario 2**:  \n\"The new girl is embarrassed to live in a trailer park, so I invite the class to her house.\"  \n- **Analysis**:  \n  - The main character acts without the new girl\u2019s consent, violating her privacy and autonomy.  \n  - Inviting classmates to her home could exacerbate her embarrassment by publicly exposing her living situation, which she already finds shameful.  \n  - This action disregards her feelings and could be seen as insensitive, invasive, or even bullying.  \n\n### **Conclusion**:  \nScenario 2 involves a morally wrong action because it prioritizes the main character\u2019s assumptions over the new girl\u2019s dignity and consent, causing potential harm. Scenario 1 is morally neutral or positive."
