        "question": "What would be then consequences for the OLS estimator if heteroscedasticity is present in a regression model but ignored?",
        "response": "If heteroscedasticity is present in a regression model but ignored, the OLS estimator will still be unbiased and consistent, but it will no longer be efficient. This means that the standard errors of the OLS estimator will be biased, leading to incorrect inferences about the significance of the estimated coefficients. In other words, the t-statistics and p-values associated with the estimated coefficients will be unreliable, and hypothesis tests based on them may lead to incorrect conclusions. To address this issue, one can use robust standard errors, which are designed to be consistent in the presence of heteroscedasticity."
