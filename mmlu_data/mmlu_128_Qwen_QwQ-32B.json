        "question": "Simplify and write the result with a rational denominator: $$\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}$$",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to simplify this expression: the square root of the cube root of the square root of 1/729. And then make sure the denominator is rational. Hmm, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me start from the innermost part, which is the square root of 1/729. The square root of 1/729... Well, the square root of 1 is 1, right? And the square root of 729? Hmm, I know that 27 squared is 729 because 27 times 27 is 729. Wait, no, actually 27 squared is 729? Let me check that. 27 times 20 is 540, and 27 times 7 is 189, so 540 + 189 is 729. Yeah, so 27 squared is 729. So the square root of 729 is 27. Therefore, the square root of 1/729 is 1/27. \n\nSo that simplifies the innermost radical. Now the next step is the cube root of that result. So the cube root of 1/27. The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 27 is 3 because 3 cubed is 27. So the cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. \n\nNow, we have to take the square root of that result. So the square root of 1/3. Hmm, the square root of 1 is 1, and the square root of 3 is irrational. So that would be 1 over the square root of 3. But the problem says to write the result with a rational denominator. So I need to rationalize the denominator here. \n\nTo rationalize the denominator, I can multiply numerator and denominator by the square root of 3. That way, the denominator becomes sqrt(3) times sqrt(3) which is 3, and the numerator becomes sqrt(3). So that would give me sqrt(3)/3. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps here. Let me go through each part again step by step to confirm. \n\nStarting over: the original expression is sqrt(cbrt(sqrt(1/729))). \n\nFirst, compute the innermost sqrt(1/729). As I did before, sqrt(1) is 1, sqrt(729) is 27, so that gives 1/27. \n\nThen, take the cube root of 1/27. Since 27 is 3^3, so the cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 27 is 3, so that gives 1/3. \n\nThen, take the square root of 1/3. Which is 1 over sqrt(3), and rationalizing the denominator gives sqrt(3)/3. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward, but let me check if there's another way to approach this by expressing all the operations with exponents. Maybe using fractional exponents? Let me try that method to confirm.\n\nExpressing each radical as an exponent:\n\nThe original expression is sqrt(cbrt(sqrt(1/729))). \n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nsqrt(1/729) is (1/729)^(1/2).\n\nThen, the cube root of that would be [(1/729)^(1/2)]^(1/3) = (1/729)^((1/2)*(1/3)) = (1/729)^(1/6).\n\nThen, taking the square root of that would be [(1/729)^(1/6)]^(1/2) = (1/729)^((1/6)*(1/2)) = (1/729)^(1/12).\n\nSo the entire expression simplifies to (1/729) raised to the 1/12 power. \n\nHmm, so 1/729 is the same as 729^(-1), so (729^(-1))^(1/12) = 729^(-1/12) = 1/(729^(1/12)).\n\nNow, 729 is 9^3, which is also 3^6, since 3^6 = (3^3)^2 = 27^2 = 729. Wait, actually 3^6 is 729. Let me confirm: 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729. Yes, so 729 is 3^6. \n\nTherefore, 729^(1/12) is (3^6)^(1/12) = 3^(6*(1/12)) = 3^(1/2) = sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, 1/(729^(1/12)) is 1/sqrt(3), which again leads us to the same point. Then, rationalizing the denominator gives sqrt(3)/3. \n\nSo both methods give me the same result. That's reassuring. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the exponents correctly. Let me go through the exponent steps again. \n\nStarting with sqrt(cbrt(sqrt(1/729))). \n\nExpressed with exponents, that's [( (1/729)^(1/2) )^(1/3) ]^(1/2). \n\nMultiplying the exponents each time: first, the inner sqrt is exponent 1/2. Then, the cube root is exponent 1/3, so total exponent after that is (1/2)*(1/3) = 1/6. Then, the outer square root is exponent 1/2, so total exponent is (1/6)*(1/2) = 1/12. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression is (1/729)^(1/12). Since 1/729 is 729^(-1), so that's 729^(-1/12). \n\nAlternatively, since 729 is 3^6, so substituting that in, we have (3^6)^(-1/12) = 3^(6*(-1/12)) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/(3^(1/2)) = 1/sqrt(3). Then, rationalizing gives sqrt(3)/3. \n\nYes, that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of 729 as 9^3, so 9 is 3^2, so 9^3 is (3^2)^3 = 3^6, which is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down 729 into prime factors. Let's see, 729 divided by 3 is 243, divided by 3 again is 81, again is 27, again is 9, again is 3. So that's 3^6. Yep, so 3^6. \n\nTherefore, 729^(1/12) is 3^(6/12) = 3^(1/2). \n\nSo that's sqrt(3). \n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to 1/sqrt(3), which becomes sqrt(3)/3 after rationalizing. \n\nHmm, so that seems to check out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by simplifying the radicals step by step, without exponents. Let me try that. \n\nStarting again with sqrt(cbrt(sqrt(1/729))). \n\nFirst step: sqrt(1/729). Since 729 is 27 squared, so sqrt(1/729) is 1/27. \n\nSecond step: cbrt(1/27). Since 27 is 3 cubed, so cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. \n\nThird step: sqrt(1/3). Which is 1 over sqrt(3). Then, rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(3): \n\n(1 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3)) = sqrt(3)/3. \n\nSame result again. \n\nSo all methods lead to sqrt(3)/3. \n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's any possible mistake in the order of operations or misinterpretation of the radicals. The original expression is sqrt{ cbrt{ sqrt{1/729} } }, right? So the square root is the outermost, then the cube root, then the innermost square root. \n\nYes, so the order is correct as I applied: first the inner sqrt, then the cube root, then the square root. \n\nAlternatively, if the expression was interpreted differently, but as written, it's nested in that order. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write all the steps in fractional exponents again to confirm. \n\nOriginal expression: sqrt[ cbrt( sqrt(1/729) ) ]\n\nExpressed as exponents:\n\n( [ (1/729)^(1/2) ]^(1/3) )^(1/2) \n\nOrder of operations: innermost first: (1/729)^(1/2) is sqrt(1/729) = 1/27.\n\nThen, raise that to 1/3: (1/27)^(1/3) = 1/3.\n\nThen, raise that to 1/2: (1/3)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/3.\n\nSame steps again. \n\nAlternatively, combining all exponents first:\n\nThe exponent on 1/729 is (1/2)*(1/3)*(1/2) = 1/12, so (1/729)^(1/12). \n\nSince 729 is 3^6, so (1/3^6)^(1/12) = 3^(-6/12) = 3^(-1/2) = 1/3^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(3). \n\nSo that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is definitely sqrt(3)/3. \n\nBut let me check if there's an alternative simplified form. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes people write it as (\u221a3)/3, which is the same as 1/\u221a3 but rationalized. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different form? Let me see. \n\nWait, the problem says \"simplify and write the result with a rational denominator\". So the key is that the denominator can't have a radical. So 1/sqrt(3) is not acceptable, but sqrt(3)/3 is. \n\nTherefore, the answer is sqrt(3)/3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as (3)^(1/2)/3, but that's the same thing. \n\nAlternatively, is there a different way to express this? Hmm, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the exponents? Let me check with numbers. \n\nSuppose I compute the original expression numerically, and then compute sqrt(3)/3 and see if they match. \n\nLet me compute step by step numerically. \n\nFirst, compute 1/729. That's approximately 0.001371742... \n\nTake the square root of that: sqrt(0.001371742). Let me compute that. \n\nWell, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27 \u2248 0.037037... \n\nThen take the cube root of 0.037037. Let's see, 0.037037 is 1/27. The cube root of 1/27 is 1/3 \u2248 0.333333... \n\nThen take the square root of 0.333333... which is sqrt(1/3) \u2248 0.57735... \n\nNow, sqrt(3)/3 is equal to approximately 1.732 / 3 \u2248 0.57735..., which matches. \n\nTherefore, numerically, it checks out. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is correct. \n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way someone might approach this problem and make a mistake. For example, maybe miscalculating the exponents? \n\nSuppose someone thought that 729 is 9^3, so 9^3 = 729. Then, sqrt(1/729) is 1/27, as before. Then cube root of 1/27 is 1/3. Then sqrt(1/3) is 1/sqrt(3), leading to the same answer. \n\nAlternatively, if someone messed up the order of operations, like taking the cube root first before the square root, but the problem specifies the square root inside first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that 729 is 729^1, so when taking the 12th root, but that's exactly what we did. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that 729 is 3^6, so 3^(6*(1/12)) is 3^(1/2), so reciprocal is 1/3^(1/2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that 729 is 9^3, so (9^3)^(1/12) is 9^(1/4) which is 3^(1/2), but that's the same as sqrt(3). \n\nHmm, so all these different ways of breaking it down lead to the same conclusion. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is definitely sqrt(3)/3. \n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that after simplifying the given expression and rationalizing the denominator, the result is sqrt(3)/3. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\n</think>\n\nTo simplify the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}}}}\\) and write the result with a rational denominator, we proceed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the innermost radical:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{729}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{729}\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{27}\n   \\]\n   because \\(\\sqrt{729} = 27\\).\n\n2. Next, take the cube root of the result:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{27}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{1}{3}\n   \\]\n   because \\(\\sqrt[3]{27} = 3\\).\n\n3. Then, take the square root of the result:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n   \\]\n\n4. Rationalize the denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the simplified expression with a rational denominator is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}\n\\]"
