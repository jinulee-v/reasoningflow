        "question": "As of 2017, how many of the world\u2019s 1-year-old children today have been vaccinated against some disease? *",
        "response": "As of 2017, global vaccination coverage for 1-year-old children was relatively high for many diseases, thanks to widespread immunization programs. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF:\n\n- **Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis (DTP3)**: Approximately **85%** of 1-year-old children globally had received three doses of the DTP vaccine, which is often used as a key indicator of immunization coverage.\n- **Measles**: Around **85%** of 1-year-old children had received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.\n- **Hepatitis B (HepB3)**: About **84%** of 1-year-old children had received three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine.\n- **Polio (Pol3)**: Roughly **85%** of 1-year-old children had received three doses of the polio vaccine.\n\nThese figures indicate that the majority of 1-year-old children globally were vaccinated against these diseases in 2017. However, coverage varied significantly by region, with lower rates in some low-income countries due to challenges in healthcare access and infrastructure."
