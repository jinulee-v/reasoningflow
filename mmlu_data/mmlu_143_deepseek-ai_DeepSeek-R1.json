        "question": "According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which of the following must an educational agency do before it changes the educational placement of a student with a disability?",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out what an educational agency must do before changing the educational placement of a student with a disability according to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA). Let me start by recalling what I know about IDEA.\n\nFirst, IDEA is a federal law that ensures students with disabilities receive free appropriate public education (FAPE). Part of this involves procedures that schools must follow when making changes to a student's educational placement. Educational placement refers to where the student receives their education, such as a regular classroom, special education classroom, or another setting.\n\nI remember that IDEA has specific provisions regarding changes in placement. One key aspect is the requirement for parental involvement. Schools typically need to notify parents and get their consent for certain actions. But wait, is it just notification or actual consent? Also, there's something about a manifestation determination review if the change is due to disciplinary actions. But the question isn't specifically about discipline, just a general placement change.\n\nAnother thing that comes to mind is the IEP (Individualized Education Program) team. Any change in placement would likely require the IEP team to meet and make decisions. The IEP team includes parents, teachers, school representatives, and sometimes the student. So maybe the agency must convene an IEP meeting to discuss and agree on the placement change.\n\nAdditionally, IDEA emphasizes the importance of prior written notice. Schools must provide parents with written notice before making any changes to the student's placement. This notice should explain the reasons for the proposed change, the options considered, and the evaluations or factors that led to the decision. That makes sense because parents have the right to be informed and involved in decisions affecting their child's education.\n\nWait, but is prior written notice sufficient, or is there a requirement for consent? For initial placement or evaluations, parental consent is required. However, for changes in placement, I think the process involves the IEP team meeting and providing prior written notice, rather than requiring explicit consent unless it's a significant change. But if the parents disagree with the change, they can request a due process hearing.\n\nSo putting this together: Before changing the educational placement, the educational agency must convene an IEP team meeting that includes the parents to discuss and agree on the change. They also must provide prior written notice to the parents, detailing the proposed changes and the reasons behind them. If the parents disagree, there are dispute resolution mechanisms available.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are any exceptions or additional steps. For example, in cases where the student's behavior leads to a disciplinary change of placement, the process might involve a manifestation determination. However, the question is general, not specific to discipline. Therefore, the main steps would be IEP team meeting and prior written notice.\n\nAnother point is that the IEP team must review the student's current IEP and determine if the proposed placement change is necessary to provide FAPE. The team should consider the student's needs and whether the new placement is the least restrictive environment (LRE) appropriate for the student. So ensuring that the change aligns with LRE requirements is part of the process.\n\nIn summary, the educational agency must:\n1. Convene an IEP team meeting with the parents to discuss and decide on the placement change.\n2. Provide prior written notice to the parents explaining the proposed change, reasons, and other relevant information.\n3. Ensure that the new placement is in the least restrictive environment appropriate for the student.\n\nI think that's it. These steps ensure that parents are involved, the decision is made collaboratively, and the student's rights under IDEA are protected."
