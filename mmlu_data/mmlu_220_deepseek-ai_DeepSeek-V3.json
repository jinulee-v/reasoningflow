        "response": "The correct statement, based on the risk ratio (RR) of 0.86, is:\n\n**\"Tea consumption is associated with a 14% lower risk of developing diabetes compared to non-consumption of tea.\"**\n\n### Explanation:\n- A risk ratio (RR) of 0.86 indicates that the risk of developing diabetes in the tea-consuming group is 86% of the risk in the non-tea-consuming group.\n- This means the risk is **14% lower** in the tea-consuming group (100% - 86% = 14%).\n- A risk ratio less than 1 suggests a protective effect of the exposure (tea consumption) on the outcome (diabetes).\n\nThis interpretation aligns with epidemiological principles as of 2020. However, it's important to consider other factors such as study design, confounding variables, and statistical significance when drawing conclusions."
