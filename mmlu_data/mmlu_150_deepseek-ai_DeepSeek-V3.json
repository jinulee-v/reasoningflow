        "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.\"\nThomas Paine, Common Sense, 1776\nWhich of the following \"miseries\" alluded to above were most condemned by Anti-Federalists of the post-Revolutionary era?",
        "response": "The \"miseries\" alluded to in Thomas Paine's *Common Sense* that were most condemned by Anti-Federalists in the post-Revolutionary era were those related to **government overreach, tyranny, and the loss of individual liberties**. Anti-Federalists were deeply concerned about the potential for a strong central government to infringe upon the rights and freedoms of the people, much like the British government had done before the Revolution. They feared that a powerful federal government, as proposed in the Constitution, could lead to oppression, excessive taxation, and the erosion of state sovereignty.\n\nSpecifically, Anti-Federalists criticized the lack of a Bill of Rights in the original Constitution, arguing that without explicit protections for individual liberties, the government could become as oppressive as the British monarchy. They also opposed the concentration of power in a central authority, advocating instead for a decentralized system that prioritized state and local governance. These concerns align with Paine's critique of government as a \"necessary evil\" that could become \"intolerable\" if it failed to protect the people's security and freedom."
