        "question": "A photocell of work function \u03d5 = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a photocell with a work function of 2 eV connected to a resistor. The light hitting the metal plate has a frequency of 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz and a power of 100 W. I need to find the current through the resistor. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a photocell, or photoelectric cell, works by the photoelectric effect. When light of sufficient frequency hits a metal surface, it ejects electrons, creating a current. The key here is that the energy of the incoming photons must be greater than the work function of the metal to eject electrons. The work function is given as 2 eV, so I need to check if the frequency provided is enough to overcome that.\n\nThe frequency given is 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz. To find the energy of each photon, I can use the equation E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency. Let me recall the value of Planck's constant. I think it's approximately 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s. But since the work function is given in electron volts, maybe I should convert that to eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602 \u00d7 10^-19 J. So, maybe I can compute the energy in eV directly?\n\nAlternatively, there's a shortcut formula where the energy in eV is (frequency in Hz) multiplied by a constant. Let me see. Since h = 4.135667696 \u00d7 10^-15 eV\u00b7s, so E (eV) = h (eV\u00b7s) * f (Hz). Let me confirm that. Yes, because 1 Hz is 1/s, so the units would be eV\u00b7s * 1/s = eV. So that works.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: E = 4.135667696 \u00d7 10^-15 eV\u00b7s * 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz. Let me compute that. The 10^-15 and 10^15 would cancel out, so it's approximately 4.135667696 eV. Let me round that to about 4.14 eV. Okay, so the photon energy is about 4.14 eV. The work function is 2 eV, so the excess energy is 4.14 - 2 = 2.14 eV. That means each photon can eject an electron with some kinetic energy, but the key point here is that the frequency is sufficient to cause the photoelectric effect. So electrons are being ejected.\n\nNow, the question is about the current through the resistor. Current is the rate of flow of charge. To find the current, I need to know how many electrons are being ejected per second, and then multiply by the charge of each electron. But since it's connected to a resistor, the current would depend on the number of electrons emitted per second, right?\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions the power of the light is 100 W. Power is energy per unit time. So, the total energy delivered by the light per second is 100 J/s. Since each photon has energy E = hf, the number of photons per second would be the total power divided by the energy per photon. Then, each photon can eject one electron (assuming 100% efficiency, which might not be the case, but maybe we can assume that here? The problem doesn't mention any efficiency, so perhaps we can assume that every photon that has enough energy ejects an electron).\n\nWait, but actually, even if the photon has enough energy, not all photons might eject an electron. The quantum efficiency might be less than 100%, but again, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we can assume that every photon above the work function threshold does eject an electron. So, proceeding with that assumption.\n\nSo, first, let's compute the number of photons per second. The power P = 100 W = 100 J/s. Each photon has energy E_photon = hf. Let me compute that in joules first. h is 6.626 \u00d7 10^-34 J\u00b7s, f is 1e15 Hz. So E_photon = 6.626e-34 * 1e15 = 6.626e-19 J per photon.\n\nTherefore, the number of photons per second N = P / E_photon = 100 J/s / 6.626e-19 J/photon. Let me compute that:\n\n100 / 6.626e-19 \u2248 1.51 \u00d7 10^20 photons per second. Let me check that division:\n\n6.626e-19 is approximately 6.626 \u00d7 10^-19. So 100 divided by that is 100 / 6.626 \u00d7 10^19 \u2248 15.1 \u00d7 10^19, which is 1.51 \u00d7 10^20. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, approximately 1.51 \u00d7 10^20 photons per second. Assuming each photon ejects one electron, then the number of electrons per second is the same, 1.51e20 electrons/s.\n\nEach electron has a charge of e = 1.602e-19 C. So the current I is the number of electrons per second multiplied by the charge per electron:\n\nI = N * e = (1.51e20 electrons/s) * (1.602e-19 C/electron)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1.51e20 * 1.602e-19 = (1.51 * 1.602) * 10^(20-19) = (2.42) * 10^1 = 24.2 A.\n\nWait, that's 24.2 Amperes? That seems really high. 100 W light source giving 24 amps? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again step by step.\n\nFirst, photon energy in joules:\n\nE_photon = h * f = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 1e15 Hz = 6.626e-19 J. That's correct.\n\nNumber of photons per second:\n\nN = P / E_photon = 100 J/s / 6.626e-19 J/photon \u2248 1.51e20 photons/s. That seems right.\n\nNumber of electrons per second is same as photons per second (assuming 100% efficiency), so 1.51e20 electrons/s.\n\nCharge per second is electrons/s * e = 1.51e20 * 1.602e-19 C/s.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.51e20 * 1.602e-19 = (1.51 * 1.602) * 10^(20-19) = (2.42) * 10^1 = 24.2 C/s, which is 24.2 A. Hmm, that's correct mathematically, but 24 amps from a 100 W light? That seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the work function is 2 eV, so even though the photon energy is 4.14 eV, which is above the work function, but maybe not all the energy is converted into current? Wait, no, the current is just the number of electrons times their charge. The energy of the electrons would be the kinetic energy, but the current is just the flow of charge. So the energy of the photons beyond the work function becomes kinetic energy of the electrons, but that doesn't affect the number of electrons, just their speed. So the number of electrons is still determined by the number of photons, assuming each photon ejects one electron.\n\nBut 24 A is a very large current. Maybe the mistake is in the assumption of 100% quantum efficiency? In reality, photoelectric materials don't have 100% efficiency. But the problem doesn't mention any efficiency, so perhaps we are to assume that every photon above the work function threshold does eject an electron. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponents?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the number of photons per second:\n\n100 W is 100 J/s. Each photon is 6.626e-19 J. So 100 divided by 6.626e-19 is indeed 100 / 6.626e-19 \u2248 1.51e20 photons per second. That's correct.\n\nThen, 1.51e20 electrons per second. Each electron is 1.6e-19 C. So 1.51e20 * 1.6e-19 = (1.51 * 1.6) * 10^(20-19) = 2.416 * 10^1 = 24.16 A. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but 24 A is a huge current. Maybe the problem is in the units? Let me check the frequency again. The frequency is 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz. Let me confirm the photon energy calculation again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have used the energy in eV from the start. Let me try that approach.\n\nPhoton energy E_photon = h*f. Using h in eV\u00b7s: h = 4.135667696 \u00d7 10^-15 eV\u00b7s. So E_photon = 4.135667696e-15 eV\u00b7s * 1e15 Hz = 4.135667696 eV. So that's about 4.14 eV, which is correct. Since the work function is 2 eV, the excess energy is 2.14 eV, so electrons are emitted.\n\nBut the number of electrons is still based on the number of photons. So the calculation seems right. Maybe 24 A is correct? Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to consider that the power is spread over the area of the plate, but the problem doesn't mention the area. Hmm, the problem says \"light of frequency f = 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell\". It just says the power is 100 W. So maybe we can assume that all the light is incident on the photocell, so the total power is 100 W. So the calculation is okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the units of work function? The work function is given as 2 eV, which is correct. So the photon energy is indeed higher than the work function, so electrons are emitted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, if the frequency was below the threshold, then no current. But here it's above, so current is as calculated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resistor is part of the circuit, but since it's in series with the photocell, the current through the resistor is the same as the current from the photocell. Since the photocell is acting as a current source here, the resistor's resistance doesn't matter for the current? Wait, but in reality, the voltage developed by the photocell would be related to the stopping potential, but in this case, since it's connected to a resistor, the current would depend on the total voltage generated by the photocell and the resistance. Wait, hold on, maybe I oversimplified.\n\nWait a second, I think I might have made a mistake here. The current in the circuit isn't just the number of electrons per second times the charge. Because in a real photocell, the electrons are ejected and create a current, but the current is also limited by the voltage developed across the circuit. Wait, but the problem says it's connected to a resistor in series. Hmm, so the photocell itself is part of the circuit with a resistor. But how does the photocell behave electrically?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the photoelectric current in terms of the saturation current. The saturation current is the maximum current when all the photoelectrons are collected, which would be when the anode is at a potential that allows all electrons to reach it. In that case, the saturation current is indeed given by the number of electrons per second times the charge. But if there is a resistor in the circuit, then the voltage across the resistor would be I*R, but unless we know the resistance, we can't find the voltage. Wait, but the problem is asking for the current through the resistor, so maybe they are assuming that the photocell is an ideal current source, so the current is just the saturation current, regardless of the resistor? But the problem mentions it's connected in series with a resistor, so perhaps the resistor is part of the load, but without knowing the resistance, how can we compute the current?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\n\"A photocell of work function \u03d5 = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\"\n\nHmm, so the photocell is connected in series with a resistor. The light is hitting the metal plate, so the photocell is generating a current. The current through the resistor would be the same as the current through the photocell, since they are in series. But to find the current, we need to know the voltage developed by the photocell and the resistance, but the problem doesn't give the resistance. Wait, that can't be. Maybe the resistor is part of the circuit but the question is just asking for the photoelectric current, assuming that the resistor doesn't affect it? Or perhaps the resistor is just there to complete the circuit, and the current is determined solely by the photoelectric effect?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to ignore the resistor's resistance and just compute the saturation current, which is the maximum possible current, which would be the number of electrons per second times the charge. Since the problem doesn't mention any voltage or resistance value, maybe that's the case. The question says \"what is the current through the resistor\", so perhaps they just want the saturation current, assuming that the circuit is set up so that all the electrons are collected, so the current is indeed 24 A. But 24 A is a very high current for a 100 W light. Let me see.\n\nWait, 100 W light, but the power is the power of the light, not the electrical power of the circuit. The light's power is 100 W, which is the energy per second of the light. The electrical power in the circuit would be I^2 * R, but since we don't know R, maybe they just want the current, which is 24 A. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming 100% efficiency?\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"connected to a resistor in series\". In a typical photocell circuit, you have a battery or a voltage source opposing the photoelectric effect, but here it's just a resistor. So the circuit is just the photocell and a resistor in series. The current would depend on the voltage generated by the photocell and the resistance. But without knowing the resistance, how can we compute the current?\n\nWait, maybe the voltage generated by the photocell is the stopping potential, which is the maximum voltage needed to stop the electrons. The stopping potential V0 is given by eV0 = hf - \u03d5. So V0 = (hf - \u03d5)/e. Let me compute that.\n\nWe have hf = 4.14 eV, \u03d5 = 2 eV, so V0 = (4.14 - 2)/1 = 2.14 V. So the stopping potential is 2.14 V. If the circuit has a resistor in series, then the current would be V0 divided by the resistance. But since the problem doesn't give the resistance, maybe they are assuming that the resistor is just part of the circuit and the current is determined by the photoelectric effect's saturation current, which is the number of electrons per second times e. But then why mention the resistor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to consider that the power of the light is 100 W, so the energy per second is 100 J/s, and the current is the total energy divided by the voltage? But that would be power = IV, so I = P/V. But then we need to know the voltage. If the voltage is the stopping potential, then I = 100 W / 2.14 V \u2248 46.7 A. But that contradicts the previous calculation.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Let me think again.\n\nThere are two ways to approach this:\n\n1. The saturation current is the number of electrons per second times the charge. So that's N * e, which we calculated as ~24 A.\n\n2. The current could also be calculated as the power divided by the voltage (if we consider the voltage as the stopping potential). But power here is the light power, not the electrical power. The electrical power would be I * V, where V is the stopping potential. But the light power is the energy of the photons per second, which is N * hf. So N = P / (hf). Then, the electrical power is I * V = (N * e) * V. But unless we know V, we can't relate it to the light power.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is mixing up the concepts. Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"A photocell of work function \u03d5 = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 \u00d7 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?\"\n\nHmm, the key here is that the photocell is connected to a resistor in series. The light's power is 100 W. The question is about the current through the resistor. Since they are in series, the current through the resistor is the same as the current through the photocell. The current in the circuit is determined by the photoelectric effect. The maximum current (saturation current) is when all the photoelectrons are collected, so that would be N * e, where N is the number of photons per second (assuming 100% efficiency). Since the problem doesn't mention any opposing voltage or resistance value, maybe they just want the saturation current, which is 24 A. But that seems high, but perhaps that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider that the energy of each photon beyond the work function contributes to the current's voltage, but the current is still determined by the number of electrons. The voltage would be the stopping potential, but the current is still N * e. The resistor would just determine the voltage drop, but since we don't have R, maybe they just want the current, which is 24 A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of photons. Let me check again:\n\nPower P = 100 W = 100 J/s.\n\nEnergy per photon E_photon = hf = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s * 1e15 Hz = 6.626e-19 J.\n\nNumber of photons per second N = P / E_photon = 100 / 6.626e-19 \u2248 1.51e20 photons/s.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, electrons per second is same as photons per second (assuming 100% efficiency), so 1.51e20 electrons/s.\n\nCharge per second is 1.51e20 * 1.6e-19 C = 24.2 C/s = 24.2 A. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, maybe the answer is indeed 24 A. Let me see if that makes sense. 100 W light, so 100 J every second. Each photon has 6.6e-19 J, so 1e20 photons per second. Each photon gives one electron, so 1e20 electrons per second. Each electron is 1.6e-19 C, so 1e20 * 1.6e-19 = 16 A. Wait, but my calculation was 1.51e20, so 24 A. Hmm, but 1e20 would be 16 A. Since 1.51e20 is 1.5 times that, so 24 A. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the answer in terms of the stopping potential and the current, but without resistance, that's not possible. Since the problem mentions the resistor in series, but doesn't give its value, perhaps the current is indeed the saturation current, which is 24 A. Maybe the resistor is just there to complete the circuit, and the question is testing understanding that the current is determined by the photoelectric effect's electron emission rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the power of the light is 100 W, but only a fraction of that is converted into electrical power. Wait, but the electrical power would be I * V, where V is the stopping potential. The light power is the total energy of the photons, which is N * hf. The electrical power is I * V = (N * e) * V. The difference between the light power and the electrical power is the kinetic energy of the electrons and any other losses. But since the problem doesn't mention efficiency or ask about power conversion, maybe it's just asking for the current, which is N * e.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the unit conversion. Let me check the photon energy again using eV:\n\nE_photon = h*f. h is 4.135667696e-15 eV\u00b7s. So 4.135667696e-15 * 1e15 = 4.135667696 eV. So that's correct. So the energy is indeed above the work function.\n\nHmm, I think my calculation is correct. Maybe 24 A is the right answer. Let me see if there's another way someone might approach it and get a different answer.\n\nWait, another thought: the power of the light is 100 W, but maybe that's the power incident on the photocell. However, the area of the photocell isn't given, so we can't compute the intensity or anything else. But since power is given, maybe it's already the total power hitting the plate, so the calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to use the relation between current and the photoelectric equation, but I don't see another way. The current is the number of electrons per second times the charge. Since each photon (above threshold) gives one electron, the number of electrons is the number of photons, so current is (P/(hf)) * e. Which is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, unless there's a missing component here, like the quantum efficiency, but since it's not mentioned, I think the answer is 24 A. Maybe the problem expects the answer in Amperes, so 24 A. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of energy. The total energy per second is 100 J. The energy per photon is 4.14 eV, which is 4.14 * 1.6e-19 J = 6.624e-19 J, which matches the earlier calculation. So number of photons is 100 / 6.624e-19 \u2248 1.51e20. So same as before.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 24 A. Maybe the problem is designed to show that even with a relatively low power light, the current can be high because electrons have small charge. 24 A is indeed high, but in terms of photoelectric effect, if all the photons are converted, that's the result. Maybe in reality, quantum efficiency is low, but since it's not given, we proceed with 100%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the frequency is not sufficient? Wait, no, 4.14 eV is higher than 2 eV, so it is sufficient.\n\nHmm, I think I have to go with 24 A. Maybe the answer is 24 A. Let me write that as the final answer, but I'm a bit unsure because 24 A seems high, but given the math, it's correct.\n\nWait, another check: 100 W light, so 100 J every second. Each electron has a charge of 1.6e-19 C. To get 24 A, that's 24 C/s. So 24 C/s * 1.6e-19 C/electron = 1.5e20 electrons/s. Each electron comes from a photon, so 1.5e20 photons/s. Each photon has energy 6.6e-19 J, so total energy per second is 1.5e20 * 6.6e-19 = 1.5 * 6.6 * 10^(1) = 9.9 J/s, which is 9.9 W. Wait, that contradicts the given power of 100 W. Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, this is a problem!\n\nWait a second, this is a critical mistake. Wait, if the current is 24 A, then the number of electrons per second is 24 / (1.6e-19) \u2248 1.5e20 electrons/s. Each electron corresponds to a photon, so number of photons is 1.5e20 per second. Each photon has energy 6.6e-19 J, so total power is 1.5e20 * 6.6e-19 = 1.5 * 6.6 * 10^(1) = 9.9 * 10^1 = 99 J/s, which is ~100 W. Wait, that actually matches the given power. Wait, so my calculation is correct. Because 1.5e20 photons/s * 6.6e-19 J/photon = 1.5 * 6.6 * 10^(20-19) = 9.9 * 10^1 = 99 J/s \u2248 100 W. So that's correct. So the power of the light is indeed the total energy of the photons, so the calculation is consistent. Therefore, the current is indeed approximately 24 A. So my initial confusion was misplaced. The numbers do check out. So the answer is 24 A.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 24 A, so 24 Amperes. So boxed, it would be \\boxed{24} A. Wait, but let me check the exact calculation again for precision.\n\nLet me do the exact calculation step by step:\n\nFirst, compute the energy per photon in joules:\n\nE_photon = h * f = 6.62607015e-34 J\u00b7s * 1e15 Hz = 6.62607015e-19 J.\n\nNumber of photons per second:\n\nN = P / E_photon = 100 / 6.62607015e-19 \u2248 100 / 6.62607015e-19 \u2248 1.509e20 photons/s.\n\nNumber of electrons per second is the same, so N_e = 1.509e20 electrons/s.\n\nCurrent I = N_e * e = 1.509e20 * 1.602176634e-19 C.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.509e20 * 1.602176634e-19 = (1.509 * 1.602176634) * 10^(20-19) \u2248 (2.417) * 10^1 \u2248 24.17 A.\n\nSo approximately 24.2 A. Rounding to two significant figures, since the given values are 2 eV (1 significant figure?), 1e15 Hz (1 significant figure?), and 100 W (1 or 3? If it's 100 as exact, maybe 3). Hmm, the work function is 2 eV (1 sig fig), frequency is 1e15 (1 sig fig), power is 100 W (could be 1 or 3). Since 100 could be 1 (if written as 1 \u00d7 10\u00b2) or 3 if it's 100.0. But given as 100 W, probably 3 sig figs. But the frequency is 1 \u00d7 10^15, which is 1 sig fig. So the least is 1 sig fig, so the answer should be 20 A? Wait, but 1e15 is 1 sig fig, so the photon energy would be 4eV (1 sig fig). Then the number of photons would be 100 / (6.6e-19) \u2248 1.5e20 (2 sig figs?), but since 1e15 is 1 sig fig, maybe the answer should be 20 A. Hmm, but the problem might expect more precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects an exact calculation with the given numbers. Let me see:\n\nIf we use h = 4.135667696e-15 eV\u00b7s, then E_photon = 4.135667696e-15 * 1e15 = 4.135667696 eV.\n\nThen, the number of photons per second is P/(E_photon in joules). Wait, but if we do it in eV:\n\nPower in eV per second: 100 W = 100 J/s = 100 / 1.602e-19 eV/s \u2248 6.242e20 eV/s.\n\nThen, number of photons per second is total energy in eV per second divided by energy per photon in eV:\n\nN = (6.242e20 eV/s) / (4.135667696 eV) \u2248 1.509e20 photons/s, same as before.\n\nThen current is same as before, so 24.2 A. So maybe the answer is 24 A, or 24.2 A. Since the given values have 1 or 2 significant figures, maybe 24 A is acceptable. Alternatively, if they want an exact answer, perhaps 24 A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that each photon produces one electron. In reality, the quantum efficiency (the probability that a photon ejects an electron) is usually less than 100%, but since it's not given, we can't account for that. The problem might be assuming 100% efficiency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to use the relation I = (P * e) / (h f), but let me see:\n\nWait, I = (number of electrons per second) * e = (P/(h f)) * e. So I = (P e)/(h f). Let me plug the numbers:\n\nP = 100 W = 100 J/s,\n\ne = 1.602e-19 C,\n\nh = 6.626e-34 J\u00b7s,\n\nf = 1e15 Hz.\n\nSo,\n\nI = (100 * 1.602e-19) / (6.626e-34 * 1e15)\n\nCompute denominator: 6.626e-34 * 1e15 = 6.626e-19,\n\nSo,\n\nI = (100 * 1.602e-19) / 6.626e-19 = (100 * 1.602)/6.626 \u2248 (160.2)/6.626 \u2248 24.2 A. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is consistent. So the answer is 24 A. So I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{24}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the current through the resistor in the photocell circuit, we start by calculating the energy of the incident photons. The energy of a photon is given by \\( E = hf \\), where \\( h \\) is Planck's constant and \\( f \\) is the frequency of the light.\n\n1. **Photon Energy Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{photon}} = h \\cdot f\n   \\]\n   Using \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\) and \\( f = 1 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{Hz} \\):\n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{photon}} = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\times 1 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{Hz} = 6.626 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of Photons per Second**:\n   The power of the light is \\( P = 100 \\, \\text{W} = 100 \\, \\text{J/s} \\). The number of photons per second is:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{P}{E_{\\text{photon}}} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{J/s}}{6.626 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/photon}} \\approx 1.51 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\text{photons/s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Current Calculation**:\n   Assuming each photon ejects one electron (100% quantum efficiency), the number of electrons per second is the same as the number of photons. The current \\( I \\) is the charge of these electrons per second:\n   \\[\n   I = N \\cdot e\n   \\]\n   where \\( e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} \\):\n   \\[\n   I = 1.51 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\text{electrons/s} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C/electron} \\approx 24.2 \\, \\text{A}\n   \\]\n\nRounding to the appropriate significant figures, the current through the resistor is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]"

The energy of a photon is given by \\( E = hf \\), where \\( h \\) is Planck's constant and \\( f \\) is the frequency of the light.\n\n1. **Photon Energy Calculation**:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{photon}} = h \\cdot f\n   \\]\n   Using \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\) and \\( f = 1 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{Hz} \\):\n   \\[\n   E_{\\text{photon}} = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s} \\times 1 \\times 10^{15} \\, \\text{Hz} = 6.626 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of Photons per Second**:\n   The power of the light is \\( P = 100 \\, \\text{W} = 100 \\, \\text{J/s} \\). The number of photons per second is:\n   \\[\n   N = \\frac{P}{E_{\\text{photon}}} = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{J/s}}{6.626 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/photon}} \\approx 1.51 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\text{photons/s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Current Calculation**:\n   Assuming each photon ejects one electron (100% quantum efficiency), the number of electrons per second is the same as the number of photons. The current \\( I \\) is the charge of these electrons per second:\n   \\[\n   I = N \\cdot e\n   \\]\n   where \\( e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C} \\):\n   \\[\n   I = 1.51 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\text{electrons/s} \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{C/electron} \\approx 24.2 \\, \\text{A}\n   \\]\n\nRounding to the appropriate significant figures, the current through the resistor is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]",
