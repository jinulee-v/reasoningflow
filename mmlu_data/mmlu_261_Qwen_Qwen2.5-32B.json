        "response": "The best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers is the lens of human rights. This lens allows us to examine the issue from a perspective of justice, equality, and the inherent dignity of all individuals, regardless of age. By focusing on human rights, we can better understand the systemic issues that lead to the recruitment and use of child soldiers, as well as the long-term impact on the children involved and the communities they come from. Additionally, this lens can help us identify and advocate for effective solutions to prevent and address the use of child soldiers in conflict zones around the world."
