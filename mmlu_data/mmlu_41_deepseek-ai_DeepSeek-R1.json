        "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about salt mixing in a tank. Let me read it again carefully.\n\n\"A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\"\n\nAlright, so initially, there's 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water. Then, they're adding a salt solution at 4 liters per minute, which has 0.02 grams per liter. The mixture is flowing out at the same rate, 4 liters per minute. So the volume in the tank remains constant at 100 liters. We need to find the amount of salt after 100 minutes.\n\nThis seems like a classic mixing problem, which usually involves setting up a differential equation. Let me recall how these problems work. The general idea is that the rate of change of the amount of salt in the tank is equal to the rate at which salt enters minus the rate at which salt leaves.\n\nLet me denote the amount of salt in the tank at time t as S(t). Then, the rate in is the concentration of the incoming solution times the flow rate, and the rate out is the concentration of the tank solution times the outflow rate.\n\nGiven that the inflow and outflow rates are both 4 L/min, the volume in the tank stays constant at 100 L. That simplifies things because otherwise, the volume would be changing, and we'd have to account for that. But here, volume is constant, so we don't have to worry about that.\n\nSo, the concentration of the incoming solution is 0.02 grams per liter. Therefore, the rate at which salt enters the tank is 0.02 g/L * 4 L/min = 0.08 g/min.\n\nThe concentration of salt in the tank at time t is S(t)/100, since the volume is 100 L. Therefore, the rate at which salt leaves the tank is (S(t)/100 g/L) * 4 L/min = (4S(t))/100 g/min = S(t)/25 g/min.\n\nTherefore, the differential equation governing S(t) is:\n\ndS/dt = rate in - rate out = 0.08 - S(t)/25.\n\nThis is a linear first-order differential equation. To solve this, I can use an integrating factor.\n\nThe standard form for a linear DE is dS/dt + P(t)S = Q(t). Let me rewrite the equation:\n\ndS/dt + (1/25)S = 0.08.\n\nHere, P(t) = 1/25, which is a constant, and Q(t) = 0.08, also constant. So the integrating factor is e^(\u222bP(t)dt) = e^(t/25).\n\nMultiplying both sides of the DE by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(t/25) dS/dt + (1/25)e^(t/25) S = 0.08 e^(t/25).\n\nThe left side is the derivative of [S(t) * e^(t/25)] with respect to t. Therefore, we can integrate both sides:\n\n\u222b d/dt [S(t) e^(t/25)] dt = \u222b 0.08 e^(t/25) dt.\n\nIntegrating both sides:\n\nS(t) e^(t/25) = 0.08 * 25 e^(t/25) + C.\n\nWait, integrating the right side: \u222b0.08 e^(t/25) dt. Let me check that integral.\n\nLet u = t/25, so du = dt/25, dt = 25 du. Then \u222b0.08 e^u *25 du = 0.08*25 \u222be^u du = 2 e^u + C = 2 e^(t/25) + C. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore:\n\nS(t) e^(t/25) = 2 e^(t/25) + C.\n\nMultiply through by e^(-t/25):\n\nS(t) = 2 + C e^(-t/25).\n\nNow apply the initial condition. At t = 0, S(0) = 3 grams.\n\nSo:\n\n3 = 2 + C e^(0) => 3 = 2 + C => C = 1.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nS(t) = 2 + e^(-t/25).\n\nWait, let me check that again. If integrating factor is e^(t/25), then after integrating, we have S(t) e^(t/25) = 0.08 * 25 e^(t/25) + C. Then 0.08*25 is 2, so that term is 2 e^(t/25). Then dividing by e^(t/25) gives S(t) = 2 + C e^(-t/25). Then initial condition S(0) = 3: 3 = 2 + C => C=1. So S(t) = 2 + e^(-t/25). Hmm, that seems too simple, but maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the integration again. Let me re-derive the solution step by step.\n\nThe differential equation is dS/dt = 0.08 - S(t)/25.\n\nRewriting: dS/dt + (1/25)S = 0.08.\n\nIntegrating factor: e^(\u222b(1/25)dt) = e^(t/25).\n\nMultiply both sides by integrating factor:\n\ne^(t/25) dS/dt + (1/25)e^(t/25) S = 0.08 e^(t/25).\n\nLeft side is d/dt [S e^(t/25)].\n\nTherefore, d/dt [S e^(t/25)] = 0.08 e^(t/25).\n\nIntegrate both sides from t=0 to t:\n\nS e^(t/25) - S(0) e^(0) = \u222b0.08 e^(\u03c4/25) d\u03c4 from \u03c4=0 to \u03c4=t.\n\nLeft side: S(t) e^(t/25) - 3.\n\nRight side: 0.08 * 25 [e^(t/25) - 1] = 2 [e^(t/25) - 1].\n\nTherefore:\n\nS(t) e^(t/25) - 3 = 2 e^(t/25) - 2.\n\nBring the 3 to the right side:\n\nS(t) e^(t/25) = 2 e^(t/25) - 2 + 3 = 2 e^(t/25) + 1.\n\nTherefore:\n\nS(t) = 2 + e^(-t/25).\n\nYes, that's correct. So S(t) = 2 + e^(-t/25). Therefore, at t=100 minutes,\n\nS(100) = 2 + e^(-100/25) = 2 + e^(-4).\n\nCalculating e^(-4) is approximately e^(-4) \u2248 0.01831563888.\n\nTherefore, S(100) \u2248 2 + 0.01831563888 \u2248 2.01831563888 grams.\n\nWait, but the initial amount was 3 grams, and we're adding salt at 0.08 g/min, but also removing it. The steady-state solution is 2 grams? That seems odd. Wait, let me check the setup again.\n\nWait, the inflow concentration is 0.02 g/L, inflow rate is 4 L/min, so the rate in is 0.02*4=0.08 g/min. The outflow rate is 4 L/min, and the concentration is S(t)/100, so rate out is 4*S(t)/100 = S(t)/25 g/min. Therefore, the differential equation is correct: dS/dt = 0.08 - S(t)/25.\n\nThe steady-state solution is when dS/dt = 0, so 0.08 = S/25 => S = 0.08*25 = 2 grams. So yes, the steady-state is 2 grams. So as t approaches infinity, S(t) approaches 2 grams. But initially, we have 3 grams, which is more than the steady-state. Therefore, the amount of salt should decrease from 3 grams towards 2 grams. But according to our solution, S(t) = 2 + e^(-t/25). At t=0, S(0)=3=2+1, correct. Then as t increases, the exponential term decays, approaching 2. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, after 100 minutes, which is 4 time constants (since the time constant is 25 minutes), e^(-4) is indeed about 0.0183, so total salt is approximately 2.0183 grams. But the problem says \"how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\" So maybe we need to give the exact value in terms of e^(-4), or compute the numerical value?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, but since it's a math problem, perhaps we can leave it in terms of e^(-4), but maybe they want a decimal. Let me check the question again.\n\n\"If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\"\n\nHmm, it doesn't specify, but in many similar problems, they might expect an exact expression, but sometimes they want a decimal. Let me see. Since e^(-4) is a clean expression, maybe we can write 2 + e^(-4), but perhaps they want a numerical answer. Let me compute e^(-4):\n\ne^4 is approximately 54.59815, so e^(-4) \u2248 1/54.59815 \u2248 0.01831563888. So 2 + 0.01831563888 \u2248 2.01831563888 grams. Rounding to, say, four decimal places, 2.0183 grams. But maybe they want more precise? Or maybe leave it as 2 + e^(-4). Let me check standard practice. In calculus problems, unless specified, sometimes they prefer the exact answer. So 2 + e^(-4) grams. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a more precise answer. Let me see.\n\nWait, but let me check my differential equation solution again. Wait, S(t) = 2 + e^(-t/25). At t=100, that's 2 + e^(-100/25) = 2 + e^(-4). So that's the exact answer. So unless they ask for a decimal, this is the exact answer. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\" It doesn't specify the form, so maybe either is acceptable, but in most higher-level math problems, exact form is preferred. However, in some engineering contexts, a decimal is preferred. Since this is a mathematics problem, perhaps exact form is better.\n\nBut let me check the initial setup again. Wait, the initial amount is 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. Wait, is that 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of solution, or 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water? The wording says \"a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water.\" So that would be 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water, but when you dissolve salt in water, the total volume might change slightly, but in these problems, they usually assume that the volume is just the water volume plus the salt volume is negligible. So here, the total volume is 100 liters. Wait, but wait, if you dissolve 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water, is the total volume 100 liters? Probably, in these problems, they consider that the salt doesn't affect the volume, so the total volume is 100 liters. Then, when they add the solution at 4 L/min, which is a salt solution with 0.02 g/L, so that's 0.02 grams of salt per liter of solution. So the incoming solution has a concentration of 0.02 g/L, and the outflow is at 4 L/min, with concentration S(t)/100 g/L.\n\nSo the setup is correct. Therefore, the solution S(t) = 2 + e^(-t/25). Therefore, at t=100, S(100) = 2 + e^(-4). So unless they want a decimal, that's the answer.\n\nBut let me check again. Wait, integrating factor method seems correct. Let me verify with another method. Suppose we solve the differential equation dS/dt = 0.08 - S/25.\n\nThis is a linear equation, and we can also solve it by separation of variables. Let's try that.\n\nRewrite the equation as dS/dt = - (S - 2)/25.\n\nLet me set y = S - 2. Then dy/dt = dS/dt = - y/25.\n\nSo dy/dt = - y/25. This is separable.\n\ndy/y = - dt/25.\n\nIntegrate both sides:\n\nln |y| = - t/25 + C.\n\nExponentiate both sides:\n\ny = C e^(-t/25).\n\nTherefore, S(t) = y + 2 = C e^(-t/25) + 2.\n\nInitial condition S(0) = 3:\n\n3 = C e^(0) + 2 => C = 1.\n\nTherefore, S(t) = 2 + e^(-t/25). Same result. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2 + e^(-4) grams. If we compute e^(-4), as above, it's approximately 0.0183, so total is approximately 2.0183 grams.\n\nBut let me check if the question is expecting maybe a different answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the inflow concentration. The problem says \"a salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water\". Wait, is that 0.02 grams per liter of solution, or per liter of water? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, \"0.02 grams of salt per liter of water\". So if it's per liter of water, then the total volume of the incoming solution would be more than the water, because when you dissolve salt in water, the volume increases. But in these problems, usually, they mean per liter of solution. Otherwise, the problem would need more information about how the volume changes when salt is added. But since the inflow and outflow rates are both 4 L/min, and the tank remains at 100 L, maybe the incoming solution is 0.02 grams of salt per liter of solution. Otherwise, if it's per liter of water, then we need to know the total volume of the incoming solution. But the problem says \"0.02 grams of salt per liter of water\", which is a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\n\"A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank...\"\n\nSo, in the incoming solution, for every liter of water, there is 0.02 grams of salt. But when you have a solution, the total volume is water volume plus salt volume, but since the salt mass is negligible compared to water, maybe they still consider the total volume as approximately equal to the water volume. So perhaps the concentration is 0.02 grams per liter of solution. Otherwise, if it's 0.02 grams per liter of water, then the total volume of the incoming solution would be slightly more than a liter, but since the salt mass is so small (0.02 grams), the volume change would be negligible. So maybe the problem is just saying 0.02 grams per liter, meaning per liter of solution. Otherwise, the problem is complicating itself unnecessarily.\n\nGiven that, I think my original interpretation is correct: 0.02 grams per liter of solution. Therefore, the inflow rate is 0.02 g/L * 4 L/min = 0.08 g/min. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2 + e^(-4) grams, which is approximately 2.0183 grams. Since the problem might expect an exact value, I should present that as 2 + e^(-4) grams. But let me check the question again.\n\nThe problem says \"how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\" It doesn't specify, but in most textbooks, they prefer the exact answer unless asked for a numerical approximation. So I think writing the answer as 2 + e^{-4} grams is acceptable. However, sometimes they want it in a box as a decimal. Let me compute e^{-4} more accurately.\n\ne^4 \u2248 54.59815\n\nTherefore, e^{-4} \u2248 1 / 54.59815 \u2248 0.01831563888\n\nSo 2 + e^{-4} \u2248 2.01831563888 grams. Rounding to, say, four decimal places, that's 2.0183 grams. Alternatively, maybe to three decimal places: 2.018 grams. But since the initial amount is 3 grams, which is exact, and the inflow is 0.02 g/L, which is exact, perhaps the answer should be exact. But e^{-4} is an exact expression. So I think the answer is 2 + e^{-4} grams. However, maybe the problem expects a different form? Let me check.\n\nWait, another way to write e^{-4} is 1/e^4. So 2 + 1/e^4. But maybe they want it written as 2 + e^{-4}. Either way is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, let me check once more.\n\nInitial salt: 3 grams in 100 liters. Inflow: 4 L/min with 0.02 g/L, so 0.08 g/min. Outflow: 4 L/min, with concentration S(t)/100 g/L, so 4*S(t)/100 = S(t)/25 g/min. So dS/dt = 0.08 - S(t)/25. Correct. Solution is S(t) = 2 + e^{-t/25}(1). At t=100, S(100)=2 + e^{-4}. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the answer. So unless the problem expects a different interpretation, this should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check units:\n\nInflow: 0.02 g/L * 4 L/min = 0.08 g/min. Outflow: 4 L/min * (S(t) g / 100 L) = 0.04 S(t) g/min. Wait, wait, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, not 0.08. Wait, hold on, 4 L/min * (S(t)/100 g/L) = (4/100) S(t) g/min = 0.04 S(t) g/min. Wait, but earlier I wrote S(t)/25. Wait, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, which is 1/25. Wait, 4/100 = 1/25? Wait, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, which is 1/25. Because 1/25 is 0.04. So 4/100 simplifies to 1/25. So 4 L/min * S(t)/100 g/L = (4/100) S(t) g/min = (1/25) S(t) g/min. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the outflow rate is S(t)/25 g/min, so the differential equation is dS/dt = 0.08 - S(t)/25. Correct.\n\nTherefore, solution is correct. So S(t) = 2 + e^{-t/25}. At t=100, S(100) = 2 + e^{-4}. So that's the answer.\n\nTherefore, the number of grams of salt in the tank after 100 minutes is 2 + e^{-4}, which is approximately 2.0183 grams. Since the problem might accept either form, but given the context, I think the exact answer is preferable. So I will present both, but specify the exact answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe amount of salt in the tank after 100 minutes is \\boxed{2 + e^{-4}} grams."

The wording says \"a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water.\" So that would be 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water, but when you dissolve salt in water, the total volume might change slightly, but in these problems, they usually assume that the volume is just the water volume plus the salt volume is negligible. So here, the total volume is 100 liters. Wait, but wait, if you dissolve 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water, is the total volume 100 liters? Probably, in these problems, they consider that the salt doesn't affect the volume, so the total volume is 100 liters.
