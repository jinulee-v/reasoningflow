        "response": "According to G.E. Moore's \"ideal utilitarianism,\" the right action is the one that brings about the greatest amount of **intrinsic good**. Moore argued that certain states of affairs, such as beauty, knowledge, and personal relationships, are intrinsically valuable\u2014meaning they are good in and of themselves, regardless of their consequences. Unlike classical utilitarianism, which focuses solely on maximizing pleasure or happiness, ideal utilitarianism considers a broader range of intrinsic goods. The morally right action, therefore, is the one that maximizes the overall amount of these intrinsic goods in the world."
