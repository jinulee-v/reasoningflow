        "question": "A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?",
        "response": "Alright, I have this problem about a tank with a salt solution, and I need to figure out how much salt is in the tank after 100 minutes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand what's going on:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The tank has 100 liters of water with 3 grams of salt dissolved in it.\n2. **Inflow**: A salt solution with 0.02 grams of salt per liter is being added at a rate of 4 liters per minute.\n3. **Outflow**: The mixed solution is flowing out at the same rate of 4 liters per minute.\n4. **Mixing**: The solution is mixed instantaneously, so the concentration is uniform throughout the tank at any time.\n5. **Goal**: Find the amount of salt in the tank after 100 minutes.\n\nOkay, so the volume of the tank is staying constant at 100 liters because the inflow and outflow rates are the same. That's good to know.\n\n### Setting Up the Problem\n\nI think this is a classic mixing problem, and I can model it using differential equations. Let's define:\n\n- \\( Q(t) \\): the amount of salt in the tank at time \\( t \\) (in grams).\n- \\( V \\): the volume of the tank, which is 100 liters.\n- \\( r \\): the flow rate, which is 4 liters per minute.\n- \\( c_{\\text{in}} \\): the concentration of salt in the incoming solution, which is 0.02 grams per liter.\n\nSince the volume is constant, the rate of change of salt in the tank is the rate at which salt is coming in minus the rate at which salt is going out.\n\n### Formulating the Differential Equation\n\nThe rate at which salt is entering the tank is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate in} = r \\times c_{\\text{in}} = 4 \\times 0.02 = 0.08 \\text{ grams per minute} \\]\n\nThe rate at which salt is leaving the tank depends on the concentration of salt in the tank at any time \\( t \\), which is \\( \\frac{Q(t)}{V} \\). So:\n\n\\[ \\text{Rate out} = r \\times \\frac{Q(t)}{V} = 4 \\times \\frac{Q(t)}{100} = \\frac{Q(t)}{25} \\text{ grams per minute} \\]\n\nTherefore, the rate of change of \\( Q(t) \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\text{Rate in} - \\text{Rate out} = 0.08 - \\frac{Q(t)}{25} \\]\n\nSo, the differential equation is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dQ}{dt} + \\frac{Q(t)}{25} = 0.08 \\]\n\n### Solving the Differential Equation\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. The standard form is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dQ}{dt} + P(t)Q = G(t) \\]\n\nIn our case, \\( P(t) = \\frac{1}{25} \\) and \\( G(t) = 0.08 \\).\n\nThe integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\mu(t) = e^{\\int P(t) dt} = e^{\\int \\frac{1}{25} dt} = e^{\\frac{t}{25}} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\n\\[ e^{\\frac{t}{25}} \\frac{dQ}{dt} + e^{\\frac{t}{25}} \\frac{Q(t)}{25} = 0.08 e^{\\frac{t}{25}} \\]\n\nThe left side is the derivative of \\( Q(t) e^{\\frac{t}{25}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( Q(t) e^{\\frac{t}{25}} \\right) = 0.08 e^{\\frac{t}{25}} \\]\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ Q(t) e^{\\frac{t}{25}} = \\int 0.08 e^{\\frac{t}{25}} dt \\]\n\nThe integral on the right side is:\n\n\\[ \\int 0.08 e^{\\frac{t}{25}} dt = 0.08 \\times 25 e^{\\frac{t}{25}} + C = 2 e^{\\frac{t}{25}} + C \\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[ Q(t) e^{\\frac{t}{25}} = 2 e^{\\frac{t}{25}} + C \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( Q(t) \\):\n\n\\[ Q(t) = 2 + C e^{-\\frac{t}{25}} \\]\n\n### Applying the Initial Condition\n\nWe know that at \\( t = 0 \\), \\( Q(0) = 3 \\) grams. Let's use this to find \\( C \\):\n\n\\[ 3 = 2 + C e^{0} \\]\n\\[ 3 = 2 + C \\]\n\\[ C = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\n\\[ Q(t) = 2 + e^{-\\frac{t}{25}} \\]\n\n### Finding the Amount of Salt After 100 Minutes\n\nNow, we need to find \\( Q(100) \\):\n\n\\[ Q(100) = 2 + e^{-\\frac{100}{25}} \\]\n\\[ Q(100) = 2 + e^{-4} \\]\n\nI know that \\( e^{-4} \\) is a small number. Let's calculate it:\n\n\\[ e^{-4} \\approx 0.0183 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ Q(100) \\approx 2 + 0.0183 = 2.0183 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter 100 minutes, the amount of salt in the tank is approximately:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.0183} \\]\n\nBut since the problem likely expects an exact value, I'll keep it in terms of \\( e \\):\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 + e^{-4}} \\]\n\nHowever, if a decimal approximation is preferred, then:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.0183} \\]\n\nBut looking back at the problem, it's probably better to leave it in exact form. So, the final answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2 + e^{-4}} \\]"
