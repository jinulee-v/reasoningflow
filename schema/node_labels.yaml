  description: 'This node includes the model''s final answer for the question. Each "attempt" of solving the problem will have one conclusion node at the end.


    Make sure the node includes what the question is actually asking for. For instance, if the question is multiple choice, only those that mention the symbol (e.g., Answer: (A) 5) can be the answer, not the ones without such intent despite having the same conclusion (e.g., therefore, the minimum number is 5). The intermediate calculations that do not have the intent to answer the question should be annotated as Reasoning.'
