  color: '#a0c4ff'
  description: '**Reflection** is a node that expresses *opinions* on the previous nodes. Reflections include both illogical emotions like *curiosity, uncertainty, and satisfaction*, and logical judgments like *correctness*.

    However, LLMs sometimes include subjective words during the reasoning process, as in "I think that (fact)" or "Wait, (fact)". Make sure the reflection nodes are not directly a part of the solution, i.e., removing the reflection node will make the reasoning trace still logically complete.

    Note: Reflection should not introduce the content of the following nodes (unlike planning nodes). It should purely reflect on the previous node without planning ahead. For instance, "I should double-check that." is an opinion, but it indicates that it will verify the node in the following steps, so it should be treated as planning.'
