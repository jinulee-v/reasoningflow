So, perfect squares are numbers like \\(0, 1, 4, 9, 16,\\) and so on. I need to prove that none of these can be written in the form \\(4n + 3\\).\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about what perfect squares look like when divided by 4. In other words, what is the remainder when a perfect square is divided by 4?\n\nLet me consider some examples:\n\n- \\(0^2 = 0\\), which is \\(4 \\times 0 + 0\\).\n\n- \\(1^2 = 1\\), which is \\(4 \\times 0 + 1\\).\n\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\), which is \\(4 \\times 1 + 0\\).\n\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\), which is \\(4 \\times 2 + 1\\).\n\n- \\(4^2 = 16\\), which is \\(4 \\times 4 + 0\\).\n\n- \\(5^2 = 25\\), which is \\(4 \\times 6 + 1\\).\n\n- \\(6^2 = 36\\), which is \\(4 \\times 9 + 0\\).\n\n- \\(7^2 = 49\\), which is \\(4 \\times 12 + 1\\).\n\nHmm, it seems like all these perfect squares are either \\(4n + 0\\) or \\(4n + 1\\). None of them are \\(4n + 2\\) or \\(4n + 3\\). But I need to specifically show that they can't be \\(4n + 3\\).\n\nMaybe there's a pattern here based on whether the number being squared is even or odd.\n\nLet's consider an even number: let’s say \\(2k\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer.\n\nThen, \\((2k)^2 = 4k^2\\), which is \\(4n + 0\\), where \\(n = k^2\\).\n\nNow, consider an odd number: let’s say \\(2k + 1\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer.\n\nThen, \\((2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1\\), which is \\(4n + 1\\), where \\(n = k^2 + k\\).\n\nSo, whether the number being squared is even or odd, its square is either \\(4n + 0\\) or \\(4n + 1\\). There’s no way it can be \\(4n + 2\\) or \\(4n + 3\\).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this covers all possible integers. Every integer is either even or odd, so this should cover all cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about modular arithmetic.

And I need to express the answer in interval notation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the inequality to have real solutions for \\( x \\). For a quadratic inequality like this, the graph is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive). The inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) represents the values of \\( x \\) where the parabola is below the x-axis.\n\nFor the quadratic to be negative for some real \\( x \\), the parabola must cross the x-axis at two distinct points. That means the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \\) must have two distinct real roots.\n\nTo have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive. The discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\).\n\nSo, for our equation \\( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \\), the coefficients are:\n\n- \\( a = 1 \\)\n\n- \\( b = -6 \\)\n\n- \\( c = c \\) (the constant term)\n\nThe discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n\nD = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c\n\n\\]\n\nFor two distinct real roots, we need \\( D > 0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\n36 - 4c > 0\n\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\n\n36 > 4c \\\\\n\n9 > c \\\\\n\nc < 9\n\n\\]\n\nBut the problem asks for positive values of \\( c \\), so \\( c > 0 \\). Therefore, combining these inequalities:\n\n\\[\n\n0 < c < 9\n\n\\]\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that the quadratic is indeed negative between the roots. Since the parabola opens upwards, it will be negative between its roots if it has two distinct real roots.\n\nLet me verify this. If \\( c < 9 \\) and \\( c > 0 \\), then the quadratic has two distinct real roots, and the parabola crosses the x-axis at two points. Between these points, the parabola is below the x-axis, meaning \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) for \\( x \\) in that interval.\n\nSo, the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) has real solutions for \\( x \\) precisely when \\( 0 < c < 9 \\).\n\nLet me consider the boundary cases. If \\( c = 9 \\), then \\( D = 0 \\), meaning one real root, and the parabola just touches the x-axis. In this case, the quadratic is never negative, because it only equals zero at that one point and is positive elsewhere.\n\nIf \\( c \\geq 9 \\), then \\( D \\leq 0 \\), meaning no real roots or one real root, and the quadratic is always non-negative. So, there are no real solutions to the inequality \\( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \\) in this case.\n\nIf \\( c \\leq 0 \\), then \\( D = 36 - 4c \\), which is greater than 36 (since \\( -4c \\) is non-negative), so \\( D > 0 \\), meaning two distinct real roots. However, the problem specifies positive values of \\( c \\), so \\( c \\leq 0 \\) is not considered.\n\nWait a second, the problem asks for positive values of \\( c \\), so \\( c > 0 \\). Therefore, the valid range is \\( 0 < c < 9 \\).\n\nLet me check with specific values to confirm.\n\nTake \\( c = 4 \\), which is between 0 and 9.\n\nThe quadratic becomes \\( x^2 - 6x + 4 < 0 \\).\n\nThe discriminant is \\( 36 - 16 = 20 \\), which is positive, so two distinct real roots.\n\nThe roots are at \\( x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{20}}{2} = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\).\n\nSo, the quadratic is negative between \\( 3 - \\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( 3 + \\sqrt{5} \\), which are real numbers.\n\nNow, take \\( c = 9 \\).\n\nThe quadratic is \\( x^2 - 6x + 9 < 0 \\), which factors to \\( (x - 3)^2 < 0 \\).\n\nThe only root is \\( x = 3 \\), and the expression is zero at \\( x = 3 \\) and positive elsewhere. So, there are no real solutions to the inequality.\n\nTake \\( c = 10 \\), which is greater than 9.\n\nThe discriminant is \\( 36 - 40 = -4 \\), which is negative, so no real roots. The quadratic is always positive, so no real solutions to the inequality.\n\nNow, take \\( c = 0 \\), although it's not positive.\n\nThe quadratic is \\( x^2 - 6x < 0 \\), which factors to \\( x(x - 6) < 0 \\).\n\nThis is negative between \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 6 \\). So, it does have real solutions, but since \\( c \\) must be positive, we exclude \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the positive values of \\( c \\) that satisfy the condition are \\( 0 < c < 9 \\).\n\nIn interval notation, this is expressed as \\( (0, 9) \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(0,9)} \\]",

        "raw_text": "Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the reaction quotient, Qc, for a given reaction at equilibrium.  The reaction is 2 NO2(g) + F2(g) ⇌ 2 NO2F(g), and I'm given the concentrations of NO2, F2, and NO2F at equilibrium: [NO2] = 0.25 M, [F2] = 0.15 M, and [NO2F] = 0.10 M. The temperature is 298 K and the pressure is 1 atm.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the reaction quotient, Qc, is. From what I recall, Qc is calculated using the same expression as the equilibrium constant, Kc, but it's calculated using the initial concentrations of the reactants and products, not necessarily the equilibrium concentrations. However, in this case, it seems like the concentrations provided are at equilibrium. So, if I calculate Qc using these concentrations, and since the system is at equilibrium, Qc should equal Kc.\n\nBut wait, the problem specifically asks for Qc, not Kc, even though it provides equilibrium concentrations. Maybe it's just a way to test if I understand that at equilibrium, Qc = Kc.\n\nAnyway, to calculate Qc for this reaction, I need to write the expression for Qc based on the balanced equation. The general form for Qc is:\n\nQc = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients\n\nSo, for the reaction 2 NO2(g) + F2(g) ⇌ 2 NO2F(g), the expression for Qc would be:\n\nQc = [NO2F]^2 / ([NO2]^2 [F2])\n\nNow, plugging in the given concentrations:\n\n[NO2F] = 0.10 M\n\n[NO2] = 0.25 M\n\n[F2] = 0.15 M\n\nSo, Qc = (0.10)^2 / ((0.25)^2 * 0.15)\n\nLet me calculate the numerator and the denominator separately to avoid mistakes.\n\nNumerator: (0.10)^2 = 0.01\n\nDenominator: (0.25)^2 = 0.0625, and then 0.0625 * 0.15 = 0.009375\n\nSo, Qc = 0.01 / 0.009375\n\nNow, dividing 0.01 by 0.009375.\n\nLet me see, 0.01 divided by 0.009375.\n\nI can think of this as 1 divided by 0.9375, since both numerator and denominator are multiplied by 1000.\n\nSo, 1 / 0.9375.\n\n0.9375 is 15/16, so 1 / (15/16) = 16/15, which is approximately 1.0667.\n\nSo, Qc ≈ 1.0667\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's 1.07.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the significant figures. The concentrations are given to two decimal places, so maybe I should keep two decimal places for Qc.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? The temperature is given as 298 K and pressure as 1 atm, but since Qc is calculated using concentrations and not partial pressures, and it's at equilibrium, I think that's all I need.\n\nJust to double-check, is there a reason why the problem specifies 298 K and 1 atm? Maybe to ensure I'm using the correct units, but since concentrations are given in molarity, and Qc is based on concentrations, I don't think temperature and pressure directly affect the calculation of Qc in this context.\n\nUnless there's a temperature dependence on the activities or something, but for this level, I think it's safe to proceed as above.\n\nSo, my final answer for Qc is approximately 1.07.",
