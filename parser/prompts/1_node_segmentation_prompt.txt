Please split the following text into "reasoning units". Reasoning units are mostly sentences, but can change by whether the sentence includes complex reasoning intents.
These sentences not need to start with alphanumeric character.

You need to further split in these cases where the sentence can be segmented into parts with different semantic roles:
- A sentence is separated by a colon, and the two parts are clearly planning and its implementation. If the planning is a single word, do not separate.
  Example:
    "Let's now find the value of a by using the equation 3a-4=7:", "a=(7+4)/3=11/3."
- A sentence that combines an externally verifiable fact and reasoning based on the fact. Note: If the fact is not an absolute fact but dependent on the context/previous steps, do not split.
  Example:
    "Since the speed of light is 299,752,258m/s,", "the kinetic energy of a particle would be approximately 1.5M Joules."
- A sentence links a reasoning-like phrase and a self evaluation by punctuations like comma and colon.
  Example:
    "The final answer for this question is 5,", "which seems plausible to me."
- A sentence that links an assumption and its consequence.
  Example:
    "Assuming a=1,", "the polynomial becomes x^2 + bx + 2b - 1 = 0."

**Note**: Do not split where there is no connecting punctuations (semicolon, colon, comma, etc.)

However, do not split:
- Simple headers or transition words
  Example:
    "1. Computing the velocity of the spacecraft"
    "Case 1: x=5"
    "Wait, let's verify the previous step."
- When the premise follows the conclusion in the single sentence.
  Example:
    "Cigarrettes should not be banned, since it provides tax income that can support the federal government."
    "This calculation seems off, because I know that the the typical C-H bond length is around 1.06 to 1.10 Ångströms."
    "Since a and b are coprimes as proved above, we can ensure that there exists an inverse element of a for multiplication modulo b and vise versa.
- When colons are used to denote simple fact and its description
  Example:
    "The derivative of xcos(x) is: \[ \cos(x) - x\sin(x) \]."
- A single latex equation block.
  Example:
    "\[\n x^2 - 4y = 0 \\ y = x^2/4 \]"
    "\begin{aligned} & \cos^2(x) - sin(2x) \\ =& \cos^2(x) - 2\sin(x)\cos(x) \\ =& \cos(x)(\cos(x) - \sin(x)) \end{aligned}"
- An equation and the following step explaning the symbols used.
  Example:
    "The kinetic energy E = mv^2/2 \n\n Where m is the mass of the object and v is the velocity."
