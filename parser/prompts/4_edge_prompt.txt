Given a destination node in a reasoning trace, find the relevant source node and edge labels according to the provided taxonomy.
- **Source nodes** should scontain necessary information for the destination's reasoning process. Source nodes should cover **all** crucial antecedents, logical premises, background knowledge, and core plans/ideas of the destination step. This system requires high recall in identifying source steps.
- Note that in most cases, with most common exceptions in reason:restate and validate:support/refute, source nodes are placed closely within the destination node.
- Each edge labels have information about "possible source labels". The selected source node and edge labels must match.
- For certain types of nodes (e.g., reflection, fact), it might not be attached to any source nodes. If there is no source node that satisfies the definitions below, you can return an empty list.

# Edge label definitions

Respond in JSON format by listing all edges that connect to the "destination step".
[
    {
        "source_node_id": "(node id)",
        "label": "(label)"
    }
]
