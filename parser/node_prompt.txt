Given a step in a reasoning trace, find the related previous step according to the taxonomy.

Reasoning traces are segmented into nodes, which are syntactically non-overlapping segments ranging from clauses to sentences (exceptionally multi-line equations), and are semantically atomic. Each node is assigned a distinct label based on its semantic role.
Each node is a JSON with following fields:
- "planning"

**Planning** introduces the content of the following nodes. It might be a coarse, high-level direction that affects tens to hundreds of nodes, or highly local plans that only affect the next node.

The rule of thumb for finding a Planning node is to check (1) if it includes active verbs like find, recall, check, solve, replace with first-person subjects, and (2) if the following node is in the following categories: Fact, Restatement, Assumption, Example, Conclusion, with its contents highly related to the Planning node.

- "fact"

**Fact** refers to a phrase that contains general external knowledge. To distinguish from other nodes, it must satisfy two criteria:

1. The information should not be given in the query.
2. It must not be deduced from other facts in a deductive/inductive manner.

The rule of thumb for finding a Fact node is to check (1) if a Wikipedia search can verify the content of the node, or (2) if the general public will know the fact and agree to it.

- "reasoning"

Reasoning includes any of deductive/inductive/abductive inference. Reasoning nodes should not present novel facts; they must refer to previous Context/Restatement/Fact/Assumption/Example/… nodes to derive the designated conclusion.

- "restatement"

Restatement is when the model copies/paraphrases the preceding text (context/previously presented steps). Typically, Restatement includes terms like ‘as seen previously’, ‘already stated’, ‘the problem’.
