        "question": "In gametogenesis, the germline undergoes two cycles of meiosis to give rise to haploid gametes. The goal of meiosis, unlike mitosis, is to separate not only the replicated sister chromatids but also the homologous chromosome pairs to form haploid cells. Fertilized gametes enter embryogenesis and ultimately develop into an organism. Meiosis is not always perfectly executed, and most such cases result in embryonic lethality. Viable events can already be detected in the karyotype of embryonic cells from the amniotic fluid. One such event results in Klinefelter's syndrome in boys. Which molecular mechanism is responsible for less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to better known Down's syndrome?\nA. progression of the polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst\nB. attachment of spindle to kinetochores in the metaphase I\nC. chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote\nD. chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis",
        "response": "Klinefelter's syndrome is characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males, leading to a 47,XXY karyotype. The phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome are generally less severe than those of Down's syndrome (trisomy 21), which is associated with a wide range of developmental and cognitive issues.\n\nThe less prominent phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome compared to Down's syndrome can be attributed to several factors, including gene dosage compensation mechanisms and the nature of the genes involved. However, among the options provided, the one that best aligns with a molecular mechanism contributing to the milder phenotype is:\n\nC. chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote\n\nHistone methylation is a key epigenetic modification that can influence gene expression. In the context of Klinefelter's syndrome, it is plausible that differential methylation patterns on the additional X chromosome could lead to silencing or reduced expression of certain genes, thereby mitigating some of the potential effects of having an extra X chromosome. This mechanism would help explain why the phenotypic consequences are less severe compared to trisomy 21, where there is no similar compensatory mechanism for the extra chromosome 21.\n\nOptions A, B, and D do not directly address the molecular mechanisms that could contribute to the milder phenotype observed in Klinefelter's syndrome."
