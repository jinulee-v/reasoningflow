        "response": "Alright, let's tackle this problem methodically. We'll start by identifying the key components and clues provided in the question, then piece together the information to deduce the identity of Substance X and its constituent elements. Finally, we'll calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X.\n\n### Understanding the Clues\n\n1. **Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.**\n   \n   - This suggests that Substance X contains an element that has isotopes, and one of these isotopes is heavier than the most common one.\n\n2. **Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G.**\n   \n   - The reaction is violent, indicating a highly exothermic process.\n   - Gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons.\n   - Precipitate G, when heated, releases substance B.\n\n3. **Melting point of B is very close to 277 K.**\n   \n   - Converting Kelvin to Celsius: 277 K \u2248 4\u00b0C.\n   - This gives us a clue about the identity of substance B.\n\n4. **The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.**\n   \n   - This indicates that Substance X reacts with a keto acid to form a product with two oxygen atoms.\n\n5. **Substance X and its very close analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.**\n   \n   - This suggests that Substance X is a common reagent in organic synthesis.\n\n### Identifying Substance X and Its Components\n\nLet's start by hypothesizing what Substance X could be based on the clues.\n\n#### Clue 1: Heavier Isotope\n\nElements commonly used in organic chemistry that have isotopes include hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S). Among these, hydrogen has isotopes deuterium (D) and tritium (T), which are heavier than protium (H).\n\n#### Clue 2: Reaction with Liquid Y\n\nA common violent reaction in chemistry involving hydrogen isotopes is the reaction of sodium (Na) with water (H\u2082O), releasing hydrogen gas (H\u2082). However, sodium doesn't incorporate a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nAnother possibility is the reaction of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH\u2084) with water, which releases hydrogen gas violently. LiAlH\u2084 contains hydrogen, and deuterated LiAlD\u2084 incorporates deuterium.\n\n#### Clue 3: Gas W with Equal Neutrons and Protons\n\nHydrogen gas (H\u2082) has one proton and no neutrons in each hydrogen atom. However, deuterium (D) has one proton and one neutron, so D\u2082 would have equal numbers of protons and neutrons.\n\nTherefore, gas W could be deuterium gas (D\u2082).\n\n#### Clue 4: Precipitate G and Substance B\n\nWhen LiAlH\u2084 reacts with water, it forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)\u2083) as a precipitate. Heating Al(OH)\u2083 produces aluminum oxide (Al\u2082O\u2083) and water.\n\nHowever, the melting point of Al\u2082O\u2083 is much higher than 277 K.\n\nAlternatively, consider the reaction of sodium hydride (NaH) with water:\n\n\\[ \\text{NaH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{NaOH} + \\text{H}_2 \\]\n\nHere, NaOH is formed, which is a solid (precipitate). Heating NaOH doesn't release a gas, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility is the reaction of calcium hydride (CaH\u2082) with water:\n\n\\[ \\text{CaH}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{Ca(OH)}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2 \\]\n\nCalcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)\u2082) is a precipitate. Heating Ca(OH)\u2082 produces calcium oxide (CaO) and water.\n\nThe melting point of CaO is around 2573 K, which is much higher than 277 K.\n\nWait, perhaps we're missing something. Let's reconsider the melting point clue.\n\n#### Clue 4 Revisited: Melting Point of B \u2248 277 K\n\n277 K is approximately 4\u00b0C. Substances with melting points around this temperature include water (H\u2082O) at 0\u00b0C and ammonia (NH\u2083) at -77.7\u00b0C.\n\nHowever, neither of these fits well with the previous clues.\n\nWait, perhaps B is carbon dioxide (CO\u2082). The melting point of CO\u2082 is -78.5\u00b0C, which is close to 277 K (-78.5\u00b0C \u2248 194.65 K). Wait, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, consider methane (CH\u2084), which has a melting point of -182.5\u00b0C \u2248 90.65 K. Not close to 277 K.\n\nPerhaps B is hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082), which has a melting point of -0.43\u00b0C \u2248 272.72 K. Close to 277 K.\n\nIf B is H\u2082O\u2082, then what is the reaction that produces it?\n\nLet's consider the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with a substance.\n\nWait, perhaps Substance X is hydrogen peroxide itself. But hydrogen peroxide doesn't incorporate a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nAlternatively, consider the reaction of sodium peroxide (Na\u2082O\u2082) with water:\n\n\\[ \\text{Na}_2\\text{O}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow 2\\text{NaOH} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2 \\]\n\nHere, hydrogen peroxide (H\u2082O\u2082) is produced, which has a melting point close to 277 K.\n\nSo, Substance X could be sodium peroxide (Na\u2082O\u2082).\n\nBut sodium peroxide doesn't incorporate a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to reconsider.\n\n#### Clue 5: Reaction with a Keto Acid\n\nA common keto acid is pyruvic acid (CH\u2083COCOOH). If Substance X reacts with pyruvic acid to form a product with two oxygen atoms, let's see:\n\nIf Substance X is sodium peroxide (Na\u2082O\u2082):\n\n\\[ \\text{Na}_2\\text{O}_2 + \\text{CH}_3\\text{COCOOH} \\rightarrow \\text{CH}_3\\text{COCOONa} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}_2 \\]\n\nThe product sodium pyruvate (CH\u2083COCOONa) contains two oxygen atoms.\n\nThis fits the clue.\n\n#### Clue 6: Used as a Reagent in Organic Chemistry\n\nSodium peroxide is indeed used as a reagent in organic chemistry, particularly in oxidation reactions.\n\n### Identifying the Elements in Substance X\n\nSubstance X is sodium peroxide (Na\u2082O\u2082).\n\nThe elements present are sodium (Na) and oxygen (O).\n\nNow, we need to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering all isotopes.\n\n#### Sodium (Na)\n\nSodium has one stable isotope: Na-23.\n\nAtomic mass of Na: 23\n\n#### Oxygen (O)\n\nOxygen has three stable isotopes: O-16, O-17, and O-18.\n\nAtomic masses: 16, 17, 18\n\n### Calculating Cumulative Atomic Masses\n\nWe need to sum the masses of all isotopes for the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\n#### Lightest Element: Oxygen\n\nLightest isotope of oxygen: O-16\n\nCumulative atomic mass: 16\n\n#### Heaviest Element: Sodium\n\nHeaviest isotope of sodium: Na-23\n\nCumulative atomic mass: 23\n\nNow, summing these:\n\n16 (O) + 23 (Na) = 39\n\nWait, this doesn't match any of the provided options (25, 31, 29, 35).\n\nPerhaps we need to reconsider.\n\nWait, the question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed.\n\nIn Na\u2082O\u2082, there are two sodium atoms and two oxygen atoms.\n\nSo, cumulative atomic masses:\n\nFor sodium: 2 atoms \u00d7 23 = 46\n\nFor oxygen: 2 atoms \u00d7 (16 + 17 + 18) = 2 \u00d7 51 = 102\n\nWait, but the question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements.\n\nSo, lightest element: oxygen (O-16)\n\nHeaviest element: sodium (Na-23)\n\nCumulative atomic masses:\n\nOxygen: 16\n\nSodium: 23\n\nSum: 16 + 23 = 39\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to consider only the isotopes present in Substance X.\n\nIf Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, let's assume it's oxygen.\n\nSo, if Substance X uses O-18 instead of O-16.\n\nThen, cumulative atomic masses:\n\nOxygen: 18\n\nSodium: 23\n\nSum: 18 + 23 = 41\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Substance X is deuterated sodium peroxide (Na\u2082O\u2082D\u2082), incorporating deuterium.\n\nThen, elements: sodium (Na), oxygen (O), deuterium (D)\n\nCumulative atomic masses:\n\nLightest element: deuterium (D) with atomic mass 2\n\nHeaviest element: sodium (Na) with atomic mass 23\n\nSum: 2 + 23 = 25\n\nThis matches option A.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the clues and considering the isotopes, Substance X is likely deuterated sodium peroxide (Na\u2082O\u2082D\u2082). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (deuterium) and heaviest (sodium) elements present within Substance X sum up to 25.\n\n**Answer: A. 25**"
