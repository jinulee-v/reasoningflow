        "response": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about particles produced in a spherical detector with radius 30 meters. These particles decay quickly, but travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the detector's inner walls. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two thirds of the particles reach the walls instead. The options are A. 68, B. 54, C. 40, D. 28.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Lorentz factor (gamma) does. The Lorentz factor is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), right? So as gamma increases, the velocity v approaches the speed of light c. Ultra-relativistic means gamma is very large, so v is approximately c. The problem says the particles travel at ultra-relativistic velocities, so maybe we can approximate their speed as c. That simplifies things.\n\nNow, the particles decay quickly, but they need to travel from the center of the detector to the walls (radius 30 meters) before decaying. The probability of a particle reaching the detector walls depends on its lifetime as measured in the lab frame. Since they are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor gamma.\n\nThe proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau. So the distance a particle travels before decaying is approximately v*gamma*tau. Since v \u2248 c, the distance is approximately c*gamma*tau.\n\nIf the detector has a radius R = 30 meters, then for a particle to reach the wall, the distance it travels must be at least R. So the condition is c*gamma*tau >= R. Therefore, the probability of a particle reaching the wall depends on the ratio R/(c*gamma*tau). If this ratio is less than 1, there's some probability; if it's greater than 1, the particle can definitely reach the wall.\n\nWait, but the problem states that with gamma ~20, one third of the particles reach the walls. So maybe the probability isn't a step function but an exponential decay? Because particles decay randomly, so the number surviving to distance R is N = N0 * exp(-t/(gamma*tau)), where t is the time taken to reach the wall. Since t = R/(v), and v \u2248 c, t \u2248 R/c. Therefore, the survival probability is exp(-R/(c*gamma*tau)).\n\nBut if the problem says that with gamma =20, the probability is 1/3, then we can set up the equation exp(-R/(c*gamma*tau)) = 1/3. Then, if we want the probability to be 2/3, we need to find the gamma such that exp(-R/(c*gamma_new*tau)) = 2/3.\n\nBut wait, if gamma increases, the lifetime in the lab frame increases, so the particles live longer, so they have a higher chance of reaching the walls. Therefore, increasing gamma should increase the survival probability. But in the problem, when gamma is 20, survival probability is 1/3, and we need to find gamma where survival probability is 2/3. But if higher gamma gives higher survival probability, then we need a higher gamma? Wait, but the answer options include both higher and lower numbers. Let's check the options again: A.68, B.54, C.40, D.28. So 68 is higher than 20, 54 is higher, 40 is higher, 28 is higher. Wait, all options are higher than 20? Wait, 28 is higher than 20? No, 28 is higher than 20? Wait, 28 is 28, which is higher than 20. Wait, 20 is the original gamma. So all answer options are higher than 20? Wait, no. Wait, 28 is 28, which is higher than 20. So all options are higher. But if gamma needs to be higher to have higher survival probability, then the answer should be one of the higher numbers. But the options are A.68, B.54, C.40, D.28. So higher gamma would mean higher survival probability. So if original gamma is 20 with 1/3 survival, then to get 2/3 survival, gamma needs to be higher. So answer should be one of A, B, C, D. But let's check.\n\nWait, but maybe I got the formula wrong. Let's think again. The survival probability is N/N0 = exp(-t/(gamma*tau)), where t is the time in the lab frame. But t = R/(v) \u2248 R/(c). So survival probability is exp(-R/(c*gamma*tau)). Therefore, if gamma increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so survival probability increases. So yes, higher gamma gives higher survival probability.\n\nTherefore, if gamma1 =20 gives survival probability 1/3, then we need to find gamma2 such that survival probability is 2/3. So:\n\nexp(-R/(c*gamma1*tau)) = 1/3\n\nand\n\nexp(-R/(c*gamma2*tau)) = 2/3\n\nWe can take the ratio of these two equations. Let's denote x = R/(c*tau). Then:\n\nexp(-x/gamma1) = 1/3\n\nexp(-x/gamma2) = 2/3\n\nTake natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-x/gamma1 = ln(1/3) = -ln(3)\n\nSo x = gamma1 * ln(3)\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation:\n\n-x/gamma2 = ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3)\n\nTherefore:\n\nx = gamma2 * (ln(3) - ln(2)) = gamma2 * ln(3/2)\n\nBut x is equal to gamma1 * ln(3), so:\n\ngamma1 * ln(3) = gamma2 * ln(3/2)\n\nTherefore, gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3)/ln(3/2)\n\nCompute ln(3) \u2248 1.0986\n\nln(3/2) \u2248 0.4055\n\nTherefore, gamma2 \u2248 20 * (1.0986 / 0.4055) \u2248 20 * 2.709 \u2248 54.18\n\nSo approximately 54. So answer B. 54.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal gamma1 =20, survival probability 1/3. So:\n\nProbability P = exp(-R/(c*gamma*tau)) = 1/3\n\nWe can write R/(c*tau) = gamma * ln(1/P)\n\nSo R/(c*tau) = 20 * ln(3) \u2248 20 *1.0986 \u224821.972\n\nThen, for P=2/3, gamma2 = R/(c*tau) / ln(1/(2/3)) = 21.972 / ln(3/2) \u224821.972 /0.4055\u224854.18\n\nYes, so gamma2\u224854.18, which is answer B.54.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.54.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}"
