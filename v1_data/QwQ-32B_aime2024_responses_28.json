        "question": "Rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem with two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. The given side lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE. Hmm, let me try to visualize this first.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order must be either D-E-C-F or some other order? Wait, but since they are collinear, the order probably matters here. Let me sketch this mentally.\n\nLet me try to draw a rough diagram in my mind. Let's assume rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So if I place point D at the origin (0,0), then since AD = 16, point A would be at (0,16). Then AB is 107, so point B would be at (107,16), and point C would be at (107,0). Wait, but then BC would be vertical? Wait, no, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if AB is horizontal, then BC would be vertical. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so sides AB and BC are perpendicular. So if AB is 107 units long, and BC is 16 units, then yes, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (107,0), B is at (107,16), and A is at (0,16). Hmm, that seems okay.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. Let me see. FG = 17 and EF = 184. Since it's a rectangle, FG and EH are the lengths, and EF and GH are the widths? Wait, depends on the orientation. Let me think. Let me try to place EFGH such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is at (0,0), C is at (107,0). So the line they are on is the x-axis. So E and F must also be on the x-axis. So E is somewhere between D and C or beyond? Hmm, but since they are rectangles, the positions might be such that EFGH is placed along the x-axis.\n\nWait, but rectangles have sides perpendicular to each other. So if EFGH is a rectangle with sides EF and FG, then if EF is 184 and FG is 17, then EF is a horizontal side (since it's collinear with D, E, C, F on the x-axis). Wait, but EF is a side of the rectangle. If E and F are on the x-axis, then the rectangle EFGH must have EF as a horizontal side, so FG would be vertical. Since FG is 17, then the vertical side from F would go up or down 17 units. Similarly, EH would be vertical as well? Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIn rectangle EFGH, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. So if EF is along the x-axis from E to F, then FG would be perpendicular to EF. Since EF is horizontal, FG would be vertical. So if F is on the x-axis, then G would be either above or below F by FG =17. Similarly, H would be connected back to E via HE. Since A, D, H, G are on a circle, that might help.\n\nWait, points A, D, H, G are concyclic. Let me note their coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to all points to make this easier.\n\nLet me fix coordinate system with point D at (0,0). Then as before:\n\n- Rectangle ABCD:\n  - D: (0, 0)\n  - C: (107, 0) because DC = AB = 107\n  - A: (0, 16) because AD = BC =16\n  - B: (107, 16)\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. Let me denote coordinates for E, F, G, H. Since D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis, so E and F must also lie on the x-axis. Let me denote E as (e, 0) and F as (f, 0). Since they are part of rectangle EFGH, the sides EF and FG are sides of the rectangle. Since EF is between E and F on the x-axis, the length EF is |f - e| = 184. Since rectangles can be placed either to the left or right, but given that D, E, C, F are collinear, the order might be important here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"such that D,E,C,F are collinear\". So the order must be D, then E, then C, then F? Or some other order? Let me think. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), so if E is between D and C, then F would be beyond C? Or maybe E is before D? Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the order. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Wait, but since E and F are vertices of the rectangle, and EF is a side of length 184, which is longer than DC (107). Hmm, so if EF is 184, which is longer than DC, perhaps the rectangle EFGH is placed such that E is to the left of D and F is to the right of C? But then the distance from E to F would have to be 184. Alternatively, maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, but then EF would be longer than DC. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is D, E, F, C? But then C would be after F, but the problem says D,E,C,F are collinear. So the order must be D, then E, then C, then F. So starting at D, going through E, then C, then F. So E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So the coordinates would be:\n\n- D: (0,0)\n- E: some point between D (0,0) and C (107,0), so E is (e,0) where 0 < e < 107\n- Then C is (107,0)\n- Then F is beyond C, so F is (f, 0) where f > 107\n\nThen the length EF would be f - e = 184. Since EF is the side of the rectangle, which is 184. So f - e = 184. Also, FG is 17, which is the other side of the rectangle. Since FG is vertical (since EF is horizontal), so from point F (f,0), moving up or down 17 units to point G. Let's assume it's above the x-axis for now. So G would be (f,17). Then H would be the other corner of the rectangle, so from E (e,0), moving up 17 units to H (e,17). Wait, but then EH would be vertical as well? Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular. So if EF is horizontal, then FG is vertical, so from F (f,0) up to G (f,17), then GH is horizontal back to H, which would be (e,17), and then HE is vertical down to E (e,0). Wait, that makes sense. So H would be (e,17), and G is (f,17). So the rectangle EFGH has coordinates:\n\n- E: (e, 0)\n- F: (f, 0)\n- G: (f,17)\n- H: (e,17)\n\nSo that's the rectangle. Now, the problem states that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me note their coordinates:\n\n- A: (0,16)\n- D: (0,0)\n- H: (e,17)\n- G: (f,17)\n\nThese four points must lie on a circle. So we can use the condition that four points lie on a circle by using the general equation of a circle or by using the cyclic quadrilateral properties. Maybe using the cyclic quadrilateral condition that the product of the slopes of the diagonals is -1 if they are perpendicular, but that's only for specific cases. Alternatively, the power of a point, or using the determinant condition for concyclic points.\n\nAlternatively, since three points determine a circle (unless they are colinear), so we can find the equation of the circle through A, D, H and then check that G lies on it. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's write coordinates again:\n\nA: (0,16)\n\nD: (0,0)\n\nH: (e,17)\n\nG: (f,17)\n\nWe need these four points to lie on a circle. Let me first find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by + c = 0. Let's plug in the points.\n\nFor point D (0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + a*0 + b*0 + c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by = 0.\n\nNow plug in point A (0,16):\n\n0 + (16)^2 + a*0 + b*16 = 0 \u21d2 256 + 16b = 0 \u21d2 16b = -256 \u21d2 b = -16.\n\nSo now the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax -16y = 0.\n\nNow plug in point H (e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (17)^2 + a*e -16*(17) = 0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + 289 + a e - 272 = 0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + a e + 17 = 0.\n\nSo that's equation (1): e\u00b2 + a e +17 = 0.\n\nNow, we need point G (f,17) to lie on the same circle. Let's plug G into the circle equation:\n\nf\u00b2 + (17)^2 + a*f -16*(17) = 0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 + 289 + a f - 272 = 0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 + a f +17 = 0.\n\nSo equation (2): f\u00b2 + a f +17 = 0.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) e\u00b2 + a e +17 = 0\n\n2) f\u00b2 + a f +17 = 0\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(f\u00b2 - e\u00b2) + a(f - e) = 0 \u21d2 (f - e)(f + e) + a(f - e) = 0 \u21d2 (f - e)(f + e + a) = 0.\n\nSo either f - e = 0 or f + e + a = 0.\n\nBut f \u2260 e because EF = 184, so f - e = 184. Therefore, f - e \u2260 0, so we must have f + e + a = 0 \u21d2 a = - (f + e).\n\nNow, substitute a = - (f + e) into equation 1:\n\ne\u00b2 + (- (f + e)) * e +17 = 0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 - e(f + e) +17 = 0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 - e f - e\u00b2 +17 = 0 \u21d2 -e f +17 =0 \u21d2 -e f = -17 \u21d2 e f =17.\n\nSo e*f =17.\n\nBut we also know from the length EF =184, which is f - e =184 (since F is after C which is at 107, so f > e, so f - e =184).\n\nTherefore, we have two equations:\n\n1) f - e = 184\n\n2) e*f =17\n\nWait, but hold on, e and f are lengths along the x-axis, with e between 0 and 107, and f beyond 107. But e*f =17? That would mean that e and f are positive numbers with product 17, but f is 184 more than e. Let me see:\n\nLet me write f = e + 184. Then substituting into e*f =17:\n\ne*(e + 184) =17 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + 184 e -17 =0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in e. Let me compute the discriminant:\n\nD = (184)^2 + 4*1*17 = 184\u00b2 + 68.\n\nBut 184 squared is 184*184. Let me compute that:\n\n184 * 184: 180\u00b2 = 32400, 4\u00b2=16, and cross term 2*180*4=1440. So (180+4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 32400+1440 is 33840 +16 is 33856. So discriminant D = 33856 + 68 = 33924.\n\nThen sqrt(33924). Let me see if this is a perfect square. Let me try 184.2 squared? Wait, 184 squared is 33856, so 184^2 = 33856, so 184.1^2 = (184 +0.1)^2 = 184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.1 +0.01 = 33856 + 36.8 +0.01= 33892.81, which is still less than 33924. 184.5^2 = (184 +0.5)^2 = 184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.5 +0.25 = 33856 + 184 +0.25 = 34040.25, which is too big. Hmm, maybe 184.2^2?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check sqrt(33924). Let me see 184^2 is 33856, so 33924 - 33856 = 68. So sqrt(33924) = 184 + 68/(2*184) approximately, but maybe it's not an integer. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the equations?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check my steps again because getting e*f =17 seems odd because e and f are lengths along the x-axis with f = e + 184, so their product being 17 would mean that e is a very small number, but even so, e*(e + 184)=17. Let me see, solving e\u00b2 +184 e -17 =0, so e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] /2. Since e must be positive (as it's a coordinate between D(0,0) and C(107,0)), so we take the positive root:\n\ne = [ -184 + sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68) ] /2. Hmm, but sqrt(184\u00b2 +68) is sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924). Let me see if 33924 is a perfect square. Let me try 184.2 squared? Wait, maybe 184.2 squared is 184^2 + 2*184*0.2 +0.2^2 = 33856 + 73.6 +0.04= 33929.64, which is over. Hmm, 184.1 squared is 184^2 + 2*184*0.1 +0.1^2 = 33856 + 36.8 +0.01= 33892.81. Hmm, so between 184.1 and 184.2. Not a perfect square. So perhaps this is okay, but the problem is that e*f =17, but e is between 0 and 107, so f = e +184 would be between 184 and 291. So e*f would be between 184*0 + ... but even if e is 0.1, then f is 184.1, so product is ~18.4, which is close to 17. Hmm, but maybe this is correct? Wait, but the problem is that the product is 17, which is quite small. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations?\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nWe had the circle equation through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17). The equations led us to e*f =17 and f - e =184. Hmm, perhaps there is an error here.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again.\n\nStarting over:\n\nCircle equation through A, D, H, G.\n\nFirst, with points D(0,0), A(0,16), H(e,17), G(f,17).\n\nWe set up the general circle equation as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y + c =0.\n\nPlugging in D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c =0 \u21d2 c=0.\n\nThen plugging in A(0,16): 0 + 256 +0 +16b +0 =0 \u21d2 256 +16b =0 \u21d2 b= -16.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0.\n\nNow plug in H(e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + a e -16*17 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 +a e -272 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 + a e +17 =0. (since 289-272=17). That's correct.\n\nThen plug in G(f,17):\n\nf\u00b2 +289 +a f -272 =0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 +a f +17 =0. Correct.\n\nSo equations 1 and 2 are correct.\n\nThen subtracting gives (f\u00b2 - e\u00b2) +a(f - e)=0 \u21d2 (f - e)(f + e +a)=0. Since f \u2260 e, then f + e +a =0 \u21d2 a = - (f + e). Correct.\n\nSubstituting back into equation 1:\n\ne\u00b2 + (-f -e)e +17 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 -e f -e\u00b2 +17 =0 \u21d2 -e f +17 =0 \u21d2 e f =17. Correct.\n\nSo that's correct. So the equations are right. So even though it's strange, the product e*f is 17, and f = e +184. So solving e(e +184)=17.\n\nSo quadratic equation e\u00b2 +184 e -17 =0.\n\nSolutions:\n\ne = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68) ] /2.\n\nWe can compute sqrt(184\u00b2 +68). Let me compute 184\u00b2 first:\n\n184 * 184:\n\n180\u00b2 = 32400,\n\n4\u00b2 =16,\n\nand cross term 2*180*4 = 1440,\n\nso (180+4)^2 = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 33856.\n\nThus sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33924). Let me see if 33924 is divisible by 4: 33924 /4 =8481. Hmm, 8481, does that have a square factor? Let me check sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481). Hmm, 8481 divided by 3: 8+4+8+1=21, so yes, 8481/3=2827. 2827, check divisibility by 3: 2+8+2+7=19, not divisible. 2827 divided by 7: 7*403=2821, remainder 6. 11: 2-8+2-7= -11, which is divisible by 11. 2827/11=257? 11*257=2827? 11*250=2750, plus 11*7=77, so 2750+77=2827. Yes. So 2827=11*257. 257 is a prime? Let me check 257 divided by primes up to sqrt(257) ~16. So 2,3,5,7,11,13. 257/2 no, 257/3 no, 5? no, 7? 7*36=252, 5 left. 11? 11*23=253, 4 left. 13? 13*19=247, 10 left. So 257 is prime. So sqrt(8481)=sqrt(3*11*257). So sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(3*11*257). So it's irrational. Therefore, e is [ -184 + sqrt(33924) ] /2. Hmm, but this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the coordinate system? Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe the rectangle EFGH is placed below the x-axis instead of above? Let me see. If G is below the x-axis, then coordinates would be G(f, -17) and H(e, -17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(f, -17). Would that make a difference?\n\nLet me try that. Let me recast the coordinates with G and H below the x-axis.\n\nSo if EFGH is below the x-axis, then:\n\n- E is (e,0), F is (f,0)\n\n- Then FG is downward, so G is (f, -17), and H is (e, -17).\n\nThen points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(f, -17) must lie on a circle.\n\nLet me redo the circle equation with these coordinates.\n\nGeneral equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y + c =0.\n\nPlug in D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c =0 \u21d2 c=0.\n\nPlug in A(0,16): 0 + 256 +0 +16b =0 \u21d2 16b = -256 \u21d2 b= -16.\n\nSo equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +a x -16 y =0.\n\nPlug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 +a e -16*(-17) =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +289 +a e +272 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +a e +561 =0.\n\nPlug in G(f, -17):\n\nf\u00b2 + (-17)^2 +a f -16*(-17)=0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 +289 +a f +272 =0 \u21d2 f\u00b2 +a f +561 =0.\n\nSo equations:\n\n1) e\u00b2 + a e +561 =0\n\n2) f\u00b2 +a f +561 =0\n\nSubtracting gives (f\u00b2 - e\u00b2) +a(f - e)=0 \u21d2 (f - e)(f + e +a)=0. Since f \u2260 e, then f + e +a =0 \u21d2 a = - (f + e).\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\ne\u00b2 + (-f -e)e +561 =0 \u21d2 e\u00b2 -e f -e\u00b2 +561 =0 \u21d2 -e f +561 =0 \u21d2 e f =561.\n\nSo now, with f - e =184 (since EF =184, and assuming F is after C, so f > e), then f = e +184.\n\nThus, e*(e +184)=561 \u21d2 e\u00b2 +184 e -561 =0.\n\nCompute discriminant D=184\u00b2 +4*561.\n\n184\u00b2 is 33856, 4*561=2244, so D=33856 +2244=36100.\n\nAh! 36100 is 190\u00b2, since 190\u00b2=36100. Perfect square!\n\nTherefore, sqrt(D)=190.\n\nThus, e = [ -184 \u00b1190 ] /2.\n\nWe take the positive solution:\n\ne = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3.\n\nSo e=3. Then f = e +184 =3 +184=187.\n\nTherefore, e=3, f=187.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates are:\n\nE is at (3,0), F is at (187,0). Since C is at (107,0), so the order on the x-axis is D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). That makes sense, as D,E,C,F are collinear in that order.\n\nTherefore, the length CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(3,0), which is 107 -3 =104. Wait, but CE is from C to E. Since E is before C, so CE is 107 -3 =104. But let me confirm.\n\nWait, coordinates of C are (107,0), E is (3,0). So distance CE is |107 -3|=104. So the answer is 104?\n\nWait, but let me check if this is consistent with the circle.\n\nSo with e=3, f=187, then a= - (f + e)= -190.\n\nSo the circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -190x -16y =0.\n\nLet me check if point H(e, -17)= (3, -17):\n\nPlug into equation: 3\u00b2 + (-17)^2 -190*3 -16*(-17) =9 +289 -570 +272.\n\nCompute: 9+289=298; 298 -570= -272; -272 +272=0. Correct.\n\nPoint G(f, -17)= (187, -17):\n\n187\u00b2 + (-17)^2 -190*187 -16*(-17).\n\nFirst, 187\u00b2: 187*187. Let me compute 180\u00b2 + 2*180*7 +7\u00b2 =32400 +2520 +49= 32400+2520=34920 +49=34969.\n\nThen (-17)^2=289. So total so far: 34969 +289=35258.\n\nThen -190*187: 190*187. 200*187=37400, minus 10*187=1870, so 37400-1870=35530. So -190*187= -35530.\n\nThen -16*(-17)=+272.\n\nSo total: 35258 -35530 +272 = (35258 -35530)= -272 +272=0. Correct.\n\nSo the circle equation works. Therefore, the coordinates are consistent.\n\nTherefore, CE is 107 -3 =104. So the answer is 104. Wait, but let me check again the problem statement to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nThe problem says \"rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear\". So the order is D,E,C,F collinear, which in my coordinate system is correct: D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So that's correct.\n\nAlso, A,D,H,G lie on a circle. In this case, A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187,-17) lie on the circle we found, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the length CE is 107 -3 =104. So I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check if the rectangle EFGH is indeed drawn correctly. Since E is (3,0), F is (187,0), so EF is 184, which is correct. FG is 17, going down to (187,-17), so that's 17 units. Then EH is from (3,0) to (3,-17), which is 17 units, so that's correct. So EFGH is a rectangle with sides 184 and 17. All good.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 104. Hmm, but let me check once more if I considered the right positions. Since the problem didn't specify whether the rectangle is above or below, but since A is at (0,16), which is above the x-axis, and the other points H and G are on the circle with A and D, if they were above, the circle might have to pass through (0,16), (0,0), and two other points above. But in that case, the product e*f would be 17, which led to a non-integer and complicated solution, but when we placed them below, we got a nice integer solution. Since the problem is likely constructed to have an integer answer, 104 makes sense. So I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n</think>\n\nGiven rectangles \\(ABCD\\) and \\(EFGH\\) with \\(D, E, C, F\\) collinear and \\(A, D, H, G\\) concyclic, we need to find the length of \\(CE\\). \n\n1. **Coordinates Setup**:\n   - Rectangle \\(ABCD\\) has \\(AB = 107\\) and \\(BC = 16\\). Placing \\(D\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), the coordinates are:\n     - \\(D(0, 0)\\), \\(A(0, 16)\\), \\(B(107, 16)\\), \\(C(107, 0)\\).\n   - Rectangle \\(EFGH\\) has \\(EF = 184\\) and \\(FG = 17\\). Points \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are collinear with \\(D\\) and \\(C\\) on the x-axis. Assuming \\(E\\) is between \\(D\\) and \\(C\\), and \\(F\\) is beyond \\(C\\), we denote \\(E(e, 0)\\) and \\(F(f, 0)\\) with \\(f - e = 184\\).\n\n2. **Circle Condition**:\n   - Points \\(A(0, 16)\\), \\(D(0, 0)\\), \\(H\\), and \\(G\\) must lie on a circle. Assuming \\(EFGH\\) is below the x-axis, coordinates for \\(H\\) and \\(G\\) are \\((e, -17)\\) and \\((f, -17)\\) respectively.\n   - The circle equation through \\(A\\), \\(D\\), \\(H\\), and \\(G\\) is derived as:\n     - General form: \\(x^2 + y^2 + ax + by + c = 0\\)\n     - Substituting points \\(D\\), \\(A\\), \\(H\\), and \\(G\\) leads to equations:\n       - \\(e^2 + ae + 561 = 0\\)\n       - \\(f^2 + af + 561 = 0\\)\n     - Solving these, we find \\(a = -(f + e)\\) and \\(ef = 561\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(e\\) and \\(f\\)**:\n   - With \\(f = e + 184\\), substituting into \\(ef = 561\\) gives:\n     - \\(e(e + 184) = 561\\)\n     - Solving the quadratic equation \\(e^2 + 184e - 561 = 0\\) yields \\(e = 3\\) and \\(f = 187\\).\n\n4. **Length \\(CE\\)**:\n   - Coordinates of \\(C\\) are \\((107, 0)\\) and \\(E\\) is \\((3, 0)\\). Thus, \\(CE = 107 - 3 = 104\\).\n\nThe length of \\(CE\\) is \\(\\boxed{104}\\)."

Placing \\(D\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), the coordinates are:\n     - \\(D(0, 0)\\), \\(A(0, 16)\\), \\(B(107, 16)\\), \\(C(107, 0)\\).\n   - Rectangle \\(EFGH\\) has \\(EF = 184\\) and \\(FG = 17\\). Points \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are collinear with \\(D\\) and \\(C\\) on the x-axis. Assuming \\(E\\) is between \\(D\\) and \\(C\\), and \\(F\\) is beyond \\(C\\), we denote \\(E(e, 0)\\) and \\(F(f, 0)\\) with \\(f - e = 184\\).\n\n2. **Circle Condition**:\n   - Points \\(A(0, 16)\\), \\(D(0, 0)\\), \\(H\\), and \\(G\\) must lie on a circle. Assuming \\(EFGH\\) is below the x-axis, coordinates for \\(H\\) and \\(G\\) are \\((e, -17)\\) and \\((f, -17)\\) respectively.\n   - The circle equation through \\(A\\), \\(D\\), \\(H\\), and \\(G\\) is derived as:\n     - General form: \\(x^2 + y^2 + ax + by + c = 0\\)\n     - Substituting points \\(D\\), \\(A\\), \\(H\\), and \\(G\\) leads to equations:\n       - \\(e^2 + ae + 561 = 0\\)\n       - \\(f^2 + af + 561 = 0\\)\n     - Solving these, we find \\(a = -(f + e)\\) and \\(ef = 561\\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\(e\\) and \\(f\\)**:\n   - With \\(f = e + 184\\), substituting into \\(ef = 561\\) gives:\n     - \\(e(e + 184) = 561\\)\n     - Solving the quadratic equation \\(e^2 + 184e - 561 = 0\\) yields \\(e = 3\\) and \\(f = 187\\).\n\n4. **Length \\(CE\\)**:\n   - Coordinates of \\(C\\) are \\((107, 0)\\) and \\(E\\) is \\((3, 0)\\). Thus, \\(CE = 107 - 3 = 104\\).\n\nThe length of \\(CE\\) is \\(\\boxed{104}\\).",
