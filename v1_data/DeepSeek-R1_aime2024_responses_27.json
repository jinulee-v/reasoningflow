        "question": "Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron such that $AB=CD= \\sqrt{41}$, $AC=BD= \\sqrt{80}$, and $BC=AD= \\sqrt{89}$. There exists a point $I$ inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from $I$ to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal. This distance can be written in the form $\\frac{m \\sqrt n}{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the distance from the incenter of a tetrahedron to each of its faces. The tetrahedron has edges with specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). The incenter is the point inside the tetrahedron that is equidistant to all four faces, and this distance is what I need to find. The answer should be in the form m\u221an/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be calculated by dividing the volume by the surface area. Wait, is that right? For a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Let me confirm that. Yes, similar to how in a triangle the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter, in 3D, it's 3 times volume divided by the total surface area. So, r = 3V / (sum of the areas of the four faces). So, if I can compute the volume V and the total surface area, then I can compute r.\n\nSo, the plan is: compute the volume of the tetrahedron, compute the areas of each of the four faces, sum them up to get the total surface area, then compute r = 3V / A_total.\n\nBut first, I need to compute the volume. However, given the edge lengths, this tetrahedron is not regular, and the edges are paired: opposite edges are equal. AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. This suggests that the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\" or has some symmetry. Maybe it's a kind of \"kite\" tetrahedron? Not sure. But perhaps I can use coordinates to compute the volume.\n\nYes, maybe placing the tetrahedron in coordinate system would help. Let me try that. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices such that I can compute the edges as given.\n\nLet me denote the vertices as A, B, C, D. Let me place vertex A at the origin (0,0,0). Then, let me place vertex B along the x-axis: B = (x, 0, 0). Then, vertex C can be in the xy-plane: C = (a, b, 0). Vertex D will be somewhere in 3D space: D = (p, q, r). Then, I can use the given edge lengths to set up equations.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, maybe it's a \"bimedian\" tetrahedron? Wait, perhaps there's a formula for the volume of such a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal. Let me recall.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that if a tetrahedron has three pairs of opposite edges equal, it is called a \"equifacial\" tetrahedron, but I might be misremembering. Wait, actually, maybe it's called a \"disphenoid\". Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So, this tetrahedron is a disphenoid. And for a disphenoid, there is a formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths.\n\nLet me check. For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / 72), but wait, maybe that's for another type. Wait, no, perhaps I need to recall that in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent. Wait, but in this case, the edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me check if the faces are congruent.\n\nWait, each face is a triangle. Let's see. The faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD. Let's check their edge lengths.\n\nFace ABC: edges AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80).\n\nFace ABD: edges AB = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80).\n\nFace ACD: edges AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89).\n\nFace BCD: edges BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80).\n\nSo, all four faces have edges sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Therefore, all four faces are congruent triangles. Therefore, this is a disphenoid, specifically a \"rhombic disphenoid\" because all faces are congruent. So, in this case, the volume can be calculated using the formula for a rhombic disphenoid.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe we can use Heron's formula to compute the area of one face and then use some relation to find the volume. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Let me try coordinates again. Let me set up coordinates for a rhombic disphenoid.\n\nIn a rhombic disphenoid, the opposite edges are equal, and all faces are congruent. So, perhaps we can place the tetrahedron such that the midpoints of the edges are at the origin or something. Wait, maybe there's a coordinate system where the vertices are symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method: since all faces are congruent triangles, we can assign coordinates such that the edges correspond to vectors in 3D space.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to compute the volume. Let me recall that in a rhombic disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) )) / (72)) but I need to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently. Let me compute the area of a face first. Since all faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me compute the area of one face using Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2. But Heron's formula is s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c). However, calculating this with square roots might be messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for area in terms of side lengths: using the formula 1/4 sqrt(4a^2b^2 - (c^2 - a^2 - b^2)^2). Wait, that's the formula for area in terms of sides a, b, c. Let me check.\n\nYes, the area can be calculated as (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) ). So, Heron's formula squared is s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c), which is equal to (1/16)(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c). Therefore, area is sqrt( (1/16)(... )) = (1/4)sqrt( ... ).\n\nSo, let's compute the area of one face. Let me denote the sides as a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).\n\nCompute the product (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c). Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (a + b + c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nSecond term: (-a + b + c) = -sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nThird term: (a - b + c) = sqrt(41) - sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)\n\nFourth term: (a + b - c) = sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) - sqrt(89)\n\nMultiplying these together would be tedious, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me note that this product is equal to ( (b + c)^2 - a^2 )( a^2 - (b - c)^2 ) = ( (sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))^2 - 41 ) ( 41 - (sqrt(80) - sqrt(89))^2 )\n\nWait, let's compute (sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))^2 = 80 + 89 + 2*sqrt(80*89) = 169 + 2*sqrt(7120). Then subtract 41: 169 - 41 = 128, so first term is 128 + 2*sqrt(7120).\n\nSimilarly, (sqrt(80) - sqrt(89))^2 = 80 + 89 - 2*sqrt(7120) = 169 - 2*sqrt(7120). Then subtract this from 41: 41 - (169 - 2*sqrt(7120)) = -128 + 2*sqrt(7120).\n\nTherefore, the product becomes (128 + 2*sqrt(7120))*(-128 + 2*sqrt(7120)) = (2*sqrt(7120))^2 - (128)^2 = 4*7120 - 16384 = 28480 - 16384 = 12096.\n\nTherefore, the product is 12096. Therefore, the area of one face is (1/4)*sqrt(12096). Let's compute sqrt(12096). Let's factor 12096:\n\nDivide by 16: 12096 / 16 = 756\n\n756 factors: 756 = 4 * 189 = 4 * 9 * 21 = 4 * 9 * 3 * 7. So sqrt(12096) = sqrt(16 * 756) = 4*sqrt(756). Then sqrt(756) = sqrt(36*21) = 6*sqrt(21). Therefore, sqrt(12096) = 4*6*sqrt(21) = 24*sqrt(21). Therefore, the area is (1/4)*24*sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21). So each face has area 6\u221a21. Therefore, total surface area A_total = 4 * 6\u221a21 = 24\u221a21.\n\nOkay, so total surface area is 24\u221a21. Now, need to compute the volume.\n\nHow to compute the volume of the tetrahedron? Since it's a rhombic disphenoid, maybe there's a formula. Alternatively, use coordinates.\n\nLet me try coordinates. Let me place the tetrahedron in coordinate system such that the midpoints of the edges are at the origin. Wait, but maybe easier to use vectors.\n\nAlternatively, since all edges are paired equally, perhaps we can assign coordinates such that the centroid is at the origin, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method. In a rhombic disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a^2 * b^2 * c^2) / ( (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) ) ) ). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use Cayley's formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of edge lengths.\n\nCayley's formula gives the volume squared in terms of a determinant involving the squares of the edge lengths. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n288 V^2 = | 0 1 1 1 1 |\n          | 1 0 a^2 b^2 c^2 |\n          | 1 a^2 0 d^2 e^2 |\n          | 1 b^2 d^2 0 f^2 |\n          | 1 c^2 e^2 f^2 0 |\n\nBut I need to assign the edge labels properly. Let me check the edge labeling.\n\nWait, in a tetrahedron, there are six edges. Let me denote the edges as follows:\n\nAB = sqrt(41), AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89),\n\nBC = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nSo, edges:\n\nAB: between A and B: sqrt(41)\n\nAC: between A and C: sqrt(80)\n\nAD: between A and D: sqrt(89)\n\nBC: between B and C: sqrt(89)\n\nBD: between B and D: sqrt(80)\n\nCD: between C and D: sqrt(41)\n\nSo, labeling the edges:\n\nAB = a = sqrt(41)\n\nAC = b = sqrt(80)\n\nAD = c = sqrt(89)\n\nBC = d = sqrt(89)\n\nBD = e = sqrt(80)\n\nCD = f = sqrt(41)\n\nSo, Cayley's determinant would be:\n\n288 V^2 = determinant of the matrix:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2\n\nRow 2: 1, a\u00b2, 0, d\u00b2, e\u00b2\n\nRow 3: 1, b\u00b2, d\u00b2, 0, f\u00b2\n\nRow 4: 1, c\u00b2, e\u00b2, f\u00b2, 0\n\nWait, Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is a 5x5 determinant. Let me confirm the exact form.\n\nYes, the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   a\u00b2   b\u00b2   c\u00b2  |\n| 1  a\u00b2   0    d\u00b2   e\u00b2  |\n| 1  b\u00b2  d\u00b2    0    f\u00b2  |\n| 1  c\u00b2  e\u00b2   f\u00b2    0   |\n\nAnd the determinant is equal to 288 V\u00b2. So, let's compute this determinant.\n\nFirst, let's square all the edge lengths:\n\na\u00b2 = 41\n\nb\u00b2 = 80\n\nc\u00b2 = 89\n\nd\u00b2 = 89\n\ne\u00b2 = 80\n\nf\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, plugging into the determinant:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nSo, we need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. This seems complicated, but maybe there's some symmetry here.\n\nLooking at the matrix:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nNotice that rows 1 to 4 are cyclic permutations of each other. Let's check:\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nYes, each subsequent row is a cyclic shift of the previous row's entries after the first column. So, perhaps this symmetry can be exploited.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract rows from each other to create zeros. Let me try.\n\nFirst, let's subtract row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4.\n\nRow 0 remains: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1 remains: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: row2 - row1: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9\n\nRow 3: row3 - row1: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48\n\nRow 4: row4 - row1: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, expand the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, use a calculator or software, but since this is a problem-solving scenario, I need to compute it manually.\n\nAlternatively, note that the determinant might be a perfect square or factorable.\n\nAlternatively, note that in a rhombic disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using another formula. Let me check.\n\nIn a rhombic disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles, and the volume can be calculated as V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2)/( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) ) ) )\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for volume in terms of face areas and dihedral angles, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron can be split into two congruent parts. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, use vector algebra. Let me assign coordinates.\n\nLet me place vertex A at (0,0,0). Let me assume that edge AB is along the x-axis, so vertex B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0). Then, vertex C is somewhere in the xy-plane, and vertex D is somewhere in 3D space.\n\nGiven that AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89), BC = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nA: (0, 0, 0)\n\nB: (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nC: (x, y, 0)\n\nD: (p, q, r)\n\nNow, compute coordinates based on distances.\n\nFirst, AC = sqrt(80): distance from A to C is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(80), so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 80.\n\nBC = sqrt(89): distance from B to C is sqrt( (x - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89). Therefore, (x - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSubtract the equation from AC: (x - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 89 - 80 => x\u00b2 - 2x sqrt(41) + 41 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 9 => -2x sqrt(41) + 41 = 9 => -2x sqrt(41) = -32 => x = (-32)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, x = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41.\n\nThen, from x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 80:\n\n( (16 sqrt(41)/41 )\u00b2 ) + y\u00b2 = 80\n\nCompute (16 sqrt(41)/41 )\u00b2 = (256 * 41) / (1681) = (256/1681)*41 = (256/41) * (41/41) * 41 = Wait, 256 * 41 / 1681. Since 1681 = 41\u00b2, so 256 * 41 / 41\u00b2 = 256 / 41.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 = 256 / 41, so y\u00b2 = 80 - 256 / 41 = (80 * 41 - 256) / 41 = (3280 - 256) / 41 = 3024 / 41. Therefore, y = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Simplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7. So sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). Therefore, y = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, y = (12 sqrt(21) * sqrt(41)) / 41 = 12 sqrt(861) / 41. Wait, but maybe leave it as 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) for now.\n\nSo coordinates of C are (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0). Wait, but sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) is sqrt(21/41). Alternatively, write as (16/sqrt(41), 12 sqrt(21/41), 0). Hmm, messy. Maybe better to rationalize denominators.\n\nAlternatively, write C as (16/sqrt(41), (12 sqrt(21))/sqrt(41), 0). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(41):\n\nC = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(21) * sqrt(41)/41, 0) = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0). Hmm, sqrt(861) is not nice. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFrom AC: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 80\n\nFrom BC: (x - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89\n\nSubtracting gives x = 16 / sqrt(41). Then x\u00b2 = 256 / 41, so y\u00b2 = 80 - 256 / 41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41. Then y = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). 3024 factors: 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7. So sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). Therefore, y = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo coordinates of C: (16/sqrt(41), 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0). Let's rationalize:\n\nx-coordinate: 16/sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41))/41\n\ny-coordinate: 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(21) sqrt(41))/41 = 12 sqrt(861)/41\n\nBut sqrt(861) is sqrt(3*7*41). Since 3, 7, 41 are primes, so sqrt(861) is already simplified. So coordinates of C are (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0).\n\nNow, need to find coordinates of D: (p, q, r). We know AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nSo, distance from A to D: sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(89) => p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 89.\n\nDistance from B to D: sqrt( (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80) => (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSubtracting the equation from AD: (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = 80 - 89 => -2 p sqrt(41) + 41 = -9 => -2 p sqrt(41) = -50 => p = (-50)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, p = 25 sqrt(41)/41.\n\nSo p = 25 sqrt(41)/41.\n\nThen, from AD: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 89.\n\nCompute p\u00b2: (25 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (625 * 41)/ (41^2) = 625 / 41.\n\nSo, 625/41 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 89 => q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 89 - 625/41 = (89*41 - 625)/41 = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024/41.\n\nSo q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 3024/41.\n\nNow, distance from C to D: sqrt( (p - x_C)^2 + (q - y_C)^2 + (r - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(41). So:\n\n(p - x_C)^2 + (q - y_C)^2 + r\u00b2 = 41.\n\nWe have p = 25 sqrt(41)/41, x_C = 16 sqrt(41)/41. So p - x_C = (25 sqrt(41) - 16 sqrt(41))/41 = 9 sqrt(41)/41. Therefore, (p - x_C)^2 = (81 * 41)/ (41^2) = 81/41.\n\nSimilarly, y_C = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(861)/41. So q - y_C = q - 12 sqrt(861)/41. Therefore, (q - y_C)^2 = q\u00b2 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q + (144 * 861)/ (41^2).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's write the equation:\n\n(p - x_C)^2 + (q - y_C)^2 + r\u00b2 = 41\n\nWe know p - x_C = 9 sqrt(41)/41, so (9 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = 81 * 41 / 41\u00b2 = 81/41.\n\nThen, (q - y_C)^2 + r\u00b2 = 41 - 81/41 = (41*41 - 81)/41 = (1681 - 81)/41 = 1600/41.\n\nBut we also know that q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 3024/41.\n\nSo, expanding (q - y_C)^2 + r\u00b2 = q\u00b2 - 2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = (q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) - 2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 = 3024/41 - 2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 = 1600/41.\n\nTherefore:\n\n3024/41 - 2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 = 1600/41\n\nSubtract 3024/41:\n\n-2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 = (1600 - 3024)/41 = -1424/41\n\nMultiply both sides by 41:\n\n-2 y_C q * 41 + y_C\u00b2 * 41 = -1424\n\nBut y_C = 12 sqrt(861)/41, so y_C\u00b2 = (144 * 861)/ (41\u00b2). Therefore, y_C\u00b2 * 41 = (144 * 861)/41.\n\nSimilarly, -2 y_C q * 41 = -2 * 12 sqrt(861)/41 * q * 41 = -24 sqrt(861) q.\n\nTherefore:\n\n-24 sqrt(861) q + (144 * 861)/41 = -1424\n\nLet me compute (144 * 861)/41:\n\n144 / 41 = 3.512 approx, but exact value is 144/41. 144 * 861 = 144 * 800 + 144 * 61 = 115200 + 8784 = 123,984. Then 123,984 / 41 = Let's divide 123,984 by 41:\n\n41 * 3000 = 123,000. 123,984 - 123,000 = 984.\n\n984 / 41 = 24. So total is 3000 + 24 = 3024. Therefore, (144 * 861)/41 = 3024.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n-24 sqrt(861) q + 3024 = -1424\n\nTherefore:\n\n-24 sqrt(861) q = -1424 - 3024 = -4448\n\nDivide both sides by -24 sqrt(861):\n\nq = (-4448)/(-24 sqrt(861)) = 4448/(24 sqrt(861)) = 4448 \u00f7 24 = 185.333... = 556/24 = 139/6. Wait, 4448 divided by 24: 24*185 = 4440, so 4448 - 4440 = 8, so 4448/24 = 185 + 8/24 = 185 + 1/3 = 556/3. Wait, no:\n\nWait, 24*185 = 24*(180 + 5) = 4320 + 120 = 4440. Then 4448 - 4440 = 8. So 4448/24 = 185 + 8/24 = 185 + 1/3 = 185.333... So 4448/(24 sqrt(861)) = (185.333...)/sqrt(861) = (556/3)/sqrt(861). Rationalizing:\n\nq = (556/3) / sqrt(861) * sqrt(861)/sqrt(861) = (556 sqrt(861))/(3 * 861). Simplify 556 and 861:\n\nFind GCD(556, 861). 861 \u00f7 556 = 1 with remainder 305\n\n556 \u00f7 305 = 1 with remainder 251\n\n305 \u00f7 251 = 1 with remainder 54\n\n251 \u00f7 54 = 4 with remainder 35\n\n54 \u00f7 35 = 1 with remainder 19\n\n35 \u00f7 19 = 1 with remainder 16\n\n19 \u00f7 16 = 1 with remainder 3\n\n16 \u00f7 3 = 5 with remainder 1\n\n3 \u00f7 1 = 3 with remainder 0. So GCD is 1. Therefore, 556 and 861 are coprime. So q = (556 sqrt(861))/(3 * 861) = (556 sqrt(861))/2583. Simplify 556/2583: divide numerator and denominator by GCD(556,2583). Let's check GCD(556,2583):\n\n2583 \u00f7 556 = 4 with remainder 359 (2583 - 4*556 = 2583 - 2224 = 359)\n\n556 \u00f7 359 = 1 with remainder 197\n\n359 \u00f7 197 = 1 with remainder 162\n\n197 \u00f7 162 = 1 with remainder 35\n\n162 \u00f7 35 = 4 with remainder 22\n\n35 \u00f7 22 = 1 with remainder 13\n\n22 \u00f7 13 = 1 with remainder 9\n\n13 \u00f7 9 = 1 with remainder 4\n\n9 \u00f7 4 = 2 with remainder 1\n\n4 \u00f7 1 = 4 with remainder 0. So GCD is 1. Therefore, 556/2583 is reduced.\n\nSo q = (556 sqrt(861))/2583. Then, since q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 3024/41, we can compute r\u00b2 = 3024/41 - q\u00b2.\n\nBut this seems very complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, coordinates of D are (25 sqrt(41)/41, q, r). We found q = 4448/(24 sqrt(861)) = 556/(3 sqrt(861)). Then, q = 556/(3 sqrt(861)) = 556 sqrt(861)/(3*861). So q\u00b2 = (556\u00b2 * 861)/(9 * 861\u00b2) = (556\u00b2)/(9*861). Then, q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 3024/41. Therefore, r\u00b2 = 3024/41 - (556\u00b2)/(9*861). This is getting too messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, D, perhaps compute vectors AB, AC, AD and compute the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, vectors:\n\nAB = B - A = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0)\n\nAD = D - A = (25 sqrt(41)/41, q, r)\n\nBut q and r are complicated expressions. Alternatively, maybe compute the scalar triple product [AB, AC, AD] = AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD). This would give 6 times the volume.\n\nBut since coordinates of D are messy, maybe this is not feasible. Alternatively, note that the volume might be symmetric and deduce it from the edge lengths.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use another formula. Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) )) / (72), but I need to check the exact formula.\n\nWait, perhaps in a disphenoid, the volume is given by V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / 72. Wait, but with what edges?\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent triangles, maybe the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) * area of face * height. Wait, but height relative to which face?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for volume in terms of face areas and dihedral angles. But I don't know the dihedral angles.\n\nWait, maybe there's a relation between the edges of a disphenoid. Let me check the properties.\n\nIn a disphenoid, the three pairs of opposite edges are equal. Here, AB=CD=sqrt(41), AC=BD=sqrt(80), AD=BC=sqrt(89). So, the three pairs are (AB, CD), (AC, BD), (AD, BC). Then, according to some properties, in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2)/( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) ) ) )\n\nWait, let me check this formula. Let me denote a, b, c as the three distinct edge lengths. Here, a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89). Then:\n\nCompute numerator: a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2 = (41)(80)(89) = 41*80*89\n\nCompute denominator: (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4)\n\nFirst compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 41 + 80 + 89 = 210\n\nThen, (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 = 210\u00b2 = 44100\n\nCompute a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = 41\u00b2 + 80\u00b2 + 89\u00b2 = 1681 + 6400 + 7921 = 1681 + 6400 = 8081 + 7921 = 16002\n\nThen, denominator = 44100 - 2*16002 = 44100 - 32004 = 12096\n\nTherefore, V = (4/3) * sqrt( (41*80*89)/12096 )\n\nCompute 41*80*89: 41*80=3280, 3280*89. Let's compute 3280*90 = 295,200, subtract 3280: 295,200 - 3,280 = 291,920. So numerator is 291,920.\n\nDenominator is 12,096.\n\nSo, V = (4/3) * sqrt(291920 / 12096 )\n\nSimplify the fraction 291920 / 12096. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 16: 291920 \u00f716=18245, 12096 \u00f716=756. So 18245/756. Check GCD(18245,756). Divide 756 into 18245:\n\n756*24=18144, 18245-18144=101. GCD(756,101). 756 \u00f7101=7 with remainder 49. 101 \u00f749=2 with remainder 3. 49 \u00f73=16 with remainder 1. 3 \u00f71=3. GCD is 1. So fraction is 18245/756.\n\nSo sqrt(18245/756). Let's factor numerator and denominator:\n\n18245: 5*3649. 3649 divided by, let's see, 3649 \u00f77=521.285..., not integer. 3649 \u00f713=280.692, not integer. Maybe prime.\n\n756= 4*189=4*9*21=4*9*3*7=2\u00b2*3\u00b3*7.\n\nSo sqrt(18245/756) = sqrt(18245)/sqrt(756) = sqrt(5*3649)/ (6*sqrt(21)) ). Since 3649 might be prime. Let's check 3649: 60\u00b2=3600, 61\u00b2=3721, so between 60\u00b2 and 61\u00b2. Test divisibility: 3649 \u00f7 7=521.285..., \u00f711=331.727..., \u00f713=280.692..., \u00f717=214.647..., \u00f719=192.05..., \u00f723=158.65..., \u00f729=125.827..., \u00f731=117.709..., \u00f737=98.621..., \u00f743=84.86..., \u00f747=77.638..., \u00f753=68.849..., \u00f759=61.847... So 3649 is prime. Therefore, sqrt(18245) = sqrt(5*3649). So sqrt(18245)/sqrt(756) = sqrt(5*3649)/(6*sqrt(21)) ). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nsqrt(5*3649*21)/(6*21) = sqrt(5*3649*21)/126.\n\nCompute 5*21=105, so sqrt(105*3649). 3649*105=3649*100 + 3649*5=364900 + 18245=383,145. So sqrt(383,145). Let's check if this is a perfect square.\n\nWhat's 619\u00b2= 600\u00b2 + 2*600*19 +19\u00b2=360,000 +22,800 +361=383,161. Which is larger than 383,145. 618\u00b2= (619 -1)^2=619\u00b2 -2*619 +1=383,161 -1,238 +1=381,924. Not matching. So sqrt(383,145) is irrational. Therefore, this approach might not be helpful.\n\nWait, but maybe the formula is incorrect. Maybe I recalled the formula wrongly. Alternatively, perhaps the volume is sqrt( (a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2) / denominator ) divided by something else.\n\nWait, let's check the formula again. If V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2)/denominator ), then:\n\nV = (4/3) * sqrt(291920 / 12096 ) = (4/3) * sqrt( (291920 / 16) / (12096 /16 )) = (4/3) * sqrt(18245 / 756 ). Which is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute 291920 / 12096 \u2248 291920 / 12096 \u2248 24.14. So sqrt(24.14) \u2248 4.91. Then V \u2248 (4/3)*4.91 \u2248 6.55. But not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the determinant using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let's try that.\n\nGiven the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\n| 0   1    1    1    1  |\n| 1   0   41   80   89  |\n| 1  41    0   89   80  |\n| 1  80   89    0   41  |\n| 1  89   80   41    0  |\n\nCompute this determinant. Let's denote the matrix as M with rows 0 to 4.\n\nThe determinant is 288 V\u00b2. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the determinant. Since the first row is [0,1,1,1,1], expanding along the first row might be tricky because of the zero. Alternatively, perform row and column operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nLet me subtract column 1 from columns 2,3,4,5. Column operations don't change the determinant.\n\nWait, column 1 is [0,1,1,1,1]. Let's subtract column 1 from columns 2-5:\n\nNew column 2: column2 - column1: [1-0, 0-1, 41-1, 80-1, 89-1] = [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]\n\nNew column3: column3 - column1: [1-0, 41-1, 0-1, 89-1, 80-1] = [1, 40, -1, 88, 79]\n\nNew column4: column4 - column1: [1-0, 80-1, 89-1, 0-1, 41-1] = [1, 79, 88, -1, 40]\n\nNew column5: column5 - column1: [1-0, 89-1, 80-1, 41-1, 0-1] = [1, 88, 79, 40, -1]\n\nSo the new matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]\n\nRow 2: [1, 40, -1, 88, 79]\n\nRow 3: [1, 79, 88, -1, 40]\n\nRow 4: [1, 88, 79, 40, -1]\n\nThis seems symmetric. Let's see if we can exploit the symmetry.\n\nNotice that rows 1 to 4 are cyclic permutations of each other. For example, row 2 is row1 shifted, row3 is row2 shifted, etc. This suggests that the determinant might be computed using properties of circulant matrices, but circulant matrices usually have the same row shifted, but here each row is a shifted version of the previous, but with different shifts. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, add all rows to the first row. Wait, but the first row is [0,1,1,1,1]. Adding other rows to it might not help. Alternatively, expand the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, expand along the first row. The determinant is:\n\n0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, the first term is 0. Then, the determinant becomes:\n\n-1 * det(M[0,1,2,3,4] with row0 and column1 removed) +\n\n1 * det(M[0,1,2,3,4] with row0 and column2 removed) -\n\n1 * det(M[0,1,2,3,4] with row0 and column3 removed) +\n\n1 * det(M[0,1,2,3,4] with row0 and column4 removed)\n\nBut this is complicated. Let me denote the determinant as follows:\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-1 * det(Matrix1) + 1 * det(Matrix2) - 1 * det(Matrix3) + 1 * det(Matrix4)\n\nWhere Matrix1 is the minor after removing row0 and column1:\n\nMatrix1:\n\nRow1: [1, 40, 79, 88]\n\nRow2: [1, -1, 88, 79]\n\nRow3: [1, 88, -1, 40]\n\nRow4: [1, 79, 40, -1]\n\nSimilarly, Matrix2 is removing row0 and column2:\n\nMatrix2:\n\nRow1: [1, -1, 79, 88]\n\nRow2: [1, 40, 88, 79]\n\nRow3: [1, 79, -1, 40]\n\nRow4: [1, 88, 40, -1]\n\nMatrix3 is removing row0 and column3:\n\nMatrix3:\n\nRow1: [1, -1, 40, 88]\n\nRow2: [1, 40, -1, 79]\n\nRow3: [1, 79, 88, 40]\n\nRow4: [1, 88, 79, -1]\n\nMatrix4 is removing row0 and column4:\n\nMatrix4:\n\nRow1: [1, -1, 40, 79]\n\nRow2: [1, 40, -1, 88]\n\nRow3: [1, 79, 88, -1]\n\nRow4: [1, 88, 79, 40]\n\nThis seems very tedious. However, notice that each of these matrices is a 4x4 matrix with a kind of symmetric pattern. Maybe compute one determinant and see if there's a pattern.\n\nLet's compute det(Matrix1):\n\nMatrix1:\n\nRow1: 1, 40, 79, 88\n\nRow2: 1, -1, 88, 79\n\nRow3: 1, 88, -1, 40\n\nRow4: 1, 79, 40, -1\n\nThis matrix has a pattern where each row is a cyclic permutation of the previous one.

So 25,600 /9 => V\u00b2 = 25,600 /9 => V = 160 /3. Therefore, V = 160/3.\n\nWait, that's a clean result. So Volume V = 160/3.\n\nBut let me verify:\n\n288 V\u00b2 = 819,200 => V\u00b2 = 819,200 / 288 = divide numerator and denominator by 32: 819,200 /32=25,600; 288/32=9. So V\u00b2=25,600/9 => V=160/3. Yes, correct.\n\nSo Volume V = 160/3.\n\nEarlier, I computed the total surface area as 24\u221a21. Therefore, the inradius r = 3V / A_total = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160 /24) / \u221a21 = (20/3) / \u221a21 = 20/(3\u221a21). Rationalizing:\n\nr = 20/(3\u221a21) * \u221a21/\u221a21 = 20\u221a21 / (3*21) = 20\u221a21 /63 = (20/63)\u221a21. Simplify 20/63: GCD(20,63)=1, so it's reduced. 21 is square-free.\n\nWait, but the problem states the answer should be in the form m\u221an /p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Here, 20\u221a21 /63. 20 and 63 are coprime (since 63=7*9, 20=2\u00b2*5). 21 is square-free (3*7). So yes, this is the form. Therefore, m=20, n=21, p=63. So m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The total surface area was 24\u221a21, right? Each face area was 6\u221a21, four faces: 24\u221a21. Volume was 160/3. Then r = 3V / A_total = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = (160/24)/\u221a21 = (20/3)/\u221a21 = 20/(3\u221a21) = 20\u221a21/63. Yes, correct. So answer is 20\u221a21 /63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 20 and 63 are coprime. 63 factors into 7*3*3. 20 is 2*2*5. No common factors. Yes, coprime. And 21 is square-free. So yes, answer is 20\u221a21/63, sum 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}"

            "text": "Let me check.\n\nIn a rhombic disphenoid, all faces are congruent triangles, and the volume can be calculated as V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b2)/( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) ) ) )\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for volume in terms of face areas and dihedral angles, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe the tetrahedron can be split into two congruent parts. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, use vector algebra. Let me assign coordinates.\n\nLet me place vertex A at (0,0,0). Let me assume that edge AB is along the x-axis, so vertex B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0). Then, vertex C is somewhere in the xy-plane, and vertex D is somewhere in 3D space.\n\nGiven that AC = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89), BC = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nA: (0, 0, 0)\n\nB: (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nC: (x, y, 0)\n\nD: (p, q, r)\n\nNow, compute coordinates based on distances.\n\nFirst, AC = sqrt(80): distance from A to C is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(80), so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 80.\n\nBC = sqrt(89): distance from B to C is sqrt( (x - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89). Therefore, (x - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89.\n\nSubtract the equation from AC: (x - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 89 - 80 => x\u00b2 - 2x sqrt(41) + 41 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 9 => -2x sqrt(41) + 41 = 9 => -2x sqrt(41) = -32 => x = (-32)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, x = (16 sqrt(41)) / 41.\n\nThen, from x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 80:\n\n( (16 sqrt(41)/41 )\u00b2 ) + y\u00b2 = 80\n\nCompute (16 sqrt(41)/41 )\u00b2 = (256 * 41) / (1681) = (256/1681)*41 = (256/41) * (41/41) * 41 = Wait, 256 * 41 / 1681. Since 1681 = 41\u00b2, so 256 * 41 / 41\u00b2 = 256 / 41.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 = 256 / 41, so y\u00b2 = 80 - 256 / 41 = (80 * 41 - 256) / 41 = (3280 - 256) / 41 = 3024 / 41. Therefore, y = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Simplify sqrt(3024):\n\n3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7. So sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). Therefore, y = 12 sqrt(21) / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, y = (12 sqrt(21) * sqrt(41)) / 41 = 12 sqrt(861) / 41. Wait, but maybe leave it as 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) for now.\n\nSo coordinates of C are (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0). Wait, but sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) is sqrt(21/41). Alternatively, write as (16/sqrt(41), 12 sqrt(21/41), 0). Hmm, messy. Maybe better to rationalize denominators.\n\nAlternatively, write C as (16/sqrt(41), (12 sqrt(21))/sqrt(41), 0). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(41):\n\nC = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(21) * sqrt(41)/41, 0) = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0). Hmm, sqrt(861) is not nice. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFrom AC: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 80\n\nFrom BC: (x - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 89\n\nSubtracting gives x = 16 / sqrt(41). Then x\u00b2 = 256 / 41, so y\u00b2 = 80 - 256 / 41 = (3280 - 256)/41 = 3024 / 41. Then y = sqrt(3024 / 41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). 3024 factors: 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7. So sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). Therefore, y = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo coordinates of C: (16/sqrt(41), 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0). Let's rationalize:\n\nx-coordinate: 16/sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41))/41\n\ny-coordinate: 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = (12 sqrt(21) sqrt(41))/41 = 12 sqrt(861)/41\n\nBut sqrt(861) is sqrt(3*7*41). Since 3, 7, 41 are primes, so sqrt(861) is already simplified. So coordinates of C are (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(861)/41, 0).\n\nNow, need to find coordinates of D: (p, q, r). We know AD = sqrt(89), BD = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41).\n\nSo, distance from A to D: sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = sqrt(89) => p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 89.\n\nDistance from B to D: sqrt( (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80) => (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSubtracting the equation from AD: (p - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) = 80 - 89 => -2 p sqrt(41) + 41 = -9 => -2 p sqrt(41) = -50 => p = (-50)/(-2 sqrt(41)) = 25 / sqrt(41). Rationalizing, p = 25 sqrt(41)/41.\n\nSo p = 25 sqrt(41)/41.\n\nThen, from AD: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 89.\n\nCompute p\u00b2: (25 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = (625 * 41)/ (41^2) = 625 / 41.\n\nSo, 625/41 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 89 => q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 89 - 625/41 = (89*41 - 625)/41 = (3649 - 625)/41 = 3024/41.\n\nSo q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 3024/41.\n\nNow, distance from C to D: sqrt( (p - x_C)^2 + (q - y_C)^2 + (r - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(41). So:\n\n(p - x_C)^2 + (q - y_C)^2 + r\u00b2 = 41.\n\nWe have p = 25 sqrt(41)/41, x_C = 16 sqrt(41)/41. So p - x_C = (25 sqrt(41) - 16 sqrt(41))/41 = 9 sqrt(41)/41. Therefore, (p - x_C)^2 = (81 * 41)/ (41^2) = 81/41.\n\nSimilarly, y_C = 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41) = 12 sqrt(861)/41. So q - y_C = q - 12 sqrt(861)/41. Therefore, (q - y_C)^2 = q\u00b2 - (24 sqrt(861)/41) q + (144 * 861)/ (41^2).\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's write the equation:\n\n(p - x_C)^2 + (q - y_C)^2 + r\u00b2 = 41\n\nWe know p - x_C = 9 sqrt(41)/41, so (9 sqrt(41)/41)^2 = 81 * 41 / 41\u00b2 = 81/41.\n\nThen, (q - y_C)^2 + r\u00b2 = 41 - 81/41 = (41*41 - 81)/41 = (1681 - 81)/41 = 1600/41.\n\nBut we also know that q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 3024/41.\n\nSo, expanding (q - y_C)^2 + r\u00b2 = q\u00b2 - 2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = (q\u00b2 + r\u00b2) - 2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 = 3024/41 - 2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 = 1600/41.\n\nTherefore:\n\n3024/41 - 2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 = 1600/41\n\nSubtract 3024/41:\n\n-2 y_C q + y_C\u00b2 = (1600 - 3024)/41 = -1424/41\n\nMultiply both sides by 41:\n\n-2 y_C q * 41 + y_C\u00b2 * 41 = -1424\n\nBut y_C = 12 sqrt(861)/41, so y_C\u00b2 = (144 * 861)/ (41\u00b2). Therefore, y_C\u00b2 * 41 = (144 * 861)/41.\n\nSimilarly, -2 y_C q * 41 = -2 * 12 sqrt(861)/41 * q * 41 = -24 sqrt(861) q.\n\nTherefore:\n\n-24 sqrt(861) q + (144 * 861)/41 = -1424\n\nLet me compute (144 * 861)/41:\n\n144 / 41 = 3.512 approx, but exact value is 144/41. 144 * 861 = 144 * 800 + 144 * 61 = 115200 + 8784 = 123,984. Then 123,984 / 41 = Let's divide 123,984 by 41:\n\n41 * 3000 = 123,000. 123,984 - 123,000 = 984.\n\n984 / 41 = 24. So total is 3000 + 24 = 3024. Therefore, (144 * 861)/41 = 3024.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n-24 sqrt(861) q + 3024 = -1424\n\nTherefore:\n\n-24 sqrt(861) q = -1424 - 3024 = -4448\n\nDivide both sides by -24 sqrt(861):\n\nq = (-4448)/(-24 sqrt(861)) = 4448/(24 sqrt(861)) = 4448 \u00f7 24 = 185.333... = 556/24 = 139/6. Wait, 4448 divided by 24: 24*185 = 4440, so 4448 - 4440 = 8, so 4448/24 = 185 + 8/24 = 185 + 1/3 = 556/3. Wait, no:\n\nWait, 24*185 = 24*(180 + 5) = 4320 + 120 = 4440. Then 4448 - 4440 = 8. So 4448/24 = 185 + 8/24 = 185 + 1/3 = 185.333... So 4448/(24 sqrt(861)) = (185.333...)/sqrt(861) = (556/3)/sqrt(861). Rationalizing:\n\nq = (556/3) / sqrt(861) * sqrt(861)/sqrt(861) = (556 sqrt(861))/(3 * 861). Simplify 556 and 861:\n\nFind GCD(556, 861). 861 \u00f7 556 = 1 with remainder 305\n\n556 \u00f7 305 = 1 with remainder 251\n\n305 \u00f7 251 = 1 with remainder 54\n\n251 \u00f7 54 = 4 with remainder 35\n\n54 \u00f7 35 = 1 with remainder 19\n\n35 \u00f7 19 = 1 with remainder 16\n\n19 \u00f7 16 = 1 with remainder 3\n\n16 \u00f7 3 = 5 with remainder 1\n\n3 \u00f7 1 = 3 with remainder 0. So GCD is 1. Therefore, 556 and 861 are coprime. So q = (556 sqrt(861))/(3 * 861) = (556 sqrt(861))/2583. Simplify 556/2583: divide numerator and denominator by GCD(556,2583). Let's check GCD(556,2583):\n\n2583 \u00f7 556 = 4 with remainder 359 (2583 - 4*556 = 2583 - 2224 = 359)\n\n556 \u00f7 359 = 1 with remainder 197\n\n359 \u00f7 197 = 1 with remainder 162\n\n197 \u00f7 162 = 1 with remainder 35\n\n162 \u00f7 35 = 4 with remainder 22\n\n35 \u00f7 22 = 1 with remainder 13\n\n22 \u00f7 13 = 1 with remainder 9\n\n13 \u00f7 9 = 1 with remainder 4\n\n9 \u00f7 4 = 2 with remainder 1\n\n4 \u00f7 1 = 4 with remainder 0. So GCD is 1. Therefore, 556/2583 is reduced.\n\nSo q = (556 sqrt(861))/2583. Then, since q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 3024/41, we can compute r\u00b2 = 3024/41 - q\u00b2.\n\nBut this seems very complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, coordinates of D are (25 sqrt(41)/41, q, r). We found q = 4448/(24 sqrt(861)) = 556/(3 sqrt(861)). Then, q = 556/(3 sqrt(861)) = 556 sqrt(861)/(3*861). So q\u00b2 = (556\u00b2 * 861)/(9 * 861\u00b2) = (556\u00b2)/(9*861). Then, q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 = 3024/41. Therefore, r\u00b2 = 3024/41 - (556\u00b2)/(9*861). This is getting too messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, D, perhaps compute vectors AB, AC, AD and compute the scalar triple product.\n\nWait, vectors:\n\nAB = B - A = (sqrt(41), 0, 0)\n\nAC = C - A = (16 sqrt(41)/41, 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0)\n\nAD = D - A = (25 sqrt(41)/41, q, r)\n\nBut q and r are complicated expressions. Alternatively, maybe compute the scalar triple product [AB, AC, AD] = AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD). This would give 6 times the volume.\n\nBut since coordinates of D are messy, maybe this is not feasible. Alternatively, note that the volume might be symmetric and deduce it from the edge lengths.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use another formula. Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(-a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2) )) / (72), but I need to check the exact formula.\n\nWait, perhaps in a disphenoid, the volume is given by V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) )) / 72. Wait, but with what edges?\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent triangles, maybe the volume can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) * area of face * height. Wait, but height relative to which face?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the formula for volume in terms of face areas and dihedral angles. But I don't know the dihedral angles.\n\nWait, maybe there's a relation between the edges of a disphenoid. Let me check the properties.\n\n",

Maybe prime.\n\n756= 4*189=4*9*21=4*9*3*7=2\u00b2*3\u00b3*7.\n\nSo sqrt(18245/756) = sqrt(18245)/sqrt(756) = sqrt(5*3649)/ (6*sqrt(21)) ). Since 3649 might be prime. Let's check 3649: 60\u00b2=3600, 61\u00b2=3721, so between 60\u00b2 and 61\u00b2. Test divisibility: 3649 \u00f7 7=521.285..., \u00f711=331.727..., \u00f713=280.692..., \u00f717=214.647..., \u00f719=192.05..., \u00f723=158.65..., \u00f729=125.827..., \u00f731=117.709..., \u00f737=98.621..., \u00f743=84.86..., \u00f747=77.638..., \u00f753=68.849..., \u00f759=61.847... So 3649 is prime. Therefore, sqrt(18245) = sqrt(5*3649). So sqrt(18245)/sqrt(756) = sqrt(5*3649)/(6*sqrt(21)) ). Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):\n\nsqrt(5*3649*21)/(6*21) = sqrt(5*3649*21)/126.\n\nCompute 5*21=105, so sqrt(105*3649). 3649*105=3649*100 + 3649*5=364900 + 18245=383,145. So sqrt(383,145). Let's check if this is a perfect square.\n\nWhat's 619\u00b2= 600\u00b2 + 2*600*19 +19\u00b2=360,000 +22,800 +361=383,161. Which is larger than 383,145. 618\u00b2= (619 -1)^2=619\u00b2 -2*619 +1=383,161 -1,238 +1=381,924. Not matching. So sqrt(383,145) is irrational. Therefore, this approach might not be helpful.\n\n",
