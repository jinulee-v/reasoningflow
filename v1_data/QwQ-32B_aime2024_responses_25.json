        "response": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts. \n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle \u03c9 again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. \n\nAlright, so first, let me visualize this. The triangle is inscribed in a circle, so it's a cyclic triangle. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then connecting A to D, which intersects the circle again at P. The goal is to find AP. \n\nHmm, tangents from a common point to a circle are equal in length. So, since D is where the tangents at B and C meet, DB and DC should be equal? Wait, no, actually, tangents from a single point to a circle are equal, so DB and DC are both tangents from D to the circle, so yes, DB = DC. That might be useful. \n\nI remember there's a theorem related to pole and polar, or maybe power of a point. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 should be equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP, since AD is a secant line. That seems important. \n\nPower of a Point says that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant segments from D to the circle. So, yes, Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. \n\nTherefore, if I can find DA and DP, or relate them somehow, maybe I can find AP. Since AP is part of AD, with AP = AD - DP, but actually, AP is from A to P, and since P is on the circle, and AD goes from A through D to P, so actually, AP is AD + DP? Wait, no, hold on. Let me think. \n\nWait, point D is outside the circle, right? Because it's the intersection of the two tangents. So the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside the circle), and then continues to intersect the circle again at P. Wait, but if D is outside, then AD starts at A, goes through D, and then P is the second intersection point with the circle? Wait, but that would mean that P is on the extension of AD beyond D. Hmm, so AP would be AD + DP? But actually, the length from A to P would be the length from A to D plus the length from D to P. But since D is outside, the Power of a Point theorem says that DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nWait, let me confirm the Power of a Point formula again. If a line through D intersects the circle at two points, say A and P, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. But here, A is on the circle, so DA is just the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But since A is on the circle, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but if A is on the circle, then DA is part of the secant, but since A is already on the circle, the power formula would be DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nWait, actually, the Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside the circle, and a secant line DAP that passes through the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = (DB)^2. Since A is on the circle, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But since A is on the circle, DA is just the length from D to A, and DP would be DA + AP? Wait, no, maybe I need to think in terms of directed lengths. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use coordinates or trigonometry here. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using inversion? Hmm, but that might be complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since we have a triangle with sides given, perhaps we can compute some angles or use the Law of Cosines or Sines. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin, point B somewhere on the x-axis, but maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, use trigonometry. Let me think. Let me recall that in triangle ABC, the lengths are AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Let me first compute some angles or the circumradius. \n\nWait, since the triangle is inscribed in a circle, maybe we can compute the circumradius R. The formula for the circumradius R of triangle ABC is (a*b*c)/(4*Area). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let me note the sides: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Let me label the sides as per standard notation: a = BC = 9, b = AC = 10, c = AB = 5. Wait, actually, in standard notation, a is opposite angle A, but maybe I should confirm. Wait, actually, in standard triangle notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, side c opposite angle C. So if we follow that, then:\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Side a = BC = 9 (opposite angle A)\n- Side b = AC = 10 (opposite angle B)\n- Side c = AB = 5 (opposite angle C)\n\nWait, but maybe that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps just compute the area first using Heron's formula. Let me do that. \n\nThe semi-perimeter, s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12. \n\nThen the area is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12 - 5)*(12 - 9)*(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[12*7*6] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[4*126] = 2*sqrt(126) = 2*sqrt(9*14) = 2*3*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). \n\nTherefore, the area is 6\u221a14. \n\nThen the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Area) = (5*9*10)/(4*6\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Let me rationalize the denominator: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. Hmm, so R = 75\u221a14 / 56. \n\nHmm, not sure if that's useful yet, but maybe. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system. Let me place point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), but wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, maybe that's not the best. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, place point A at (0,0), point B at (5,0), but then AC is 10, BC is 9. Hmm, perhaps coordinate geometry is doable here. Let me try that. \n\nLet me set point A at (0,0). Let me let point B be at (c,0), but maybe that complicates. Alternatively, let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (x, y), point C at (p, q). Hmm, but that might get too involved. \n\nAlternatively, use barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC. Hmm, perhaps. \n\nAlternatively, use trigonometry. Let me think. Let me denote angle at A as \u03b1, angle at B as \u03b2, angle at C as \u03b3. Then using the Law of Cosines, perhaps compute angles. \n\nWait, let me compute angle at B first. Wait, sides: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. \n\nWait, angle at B is between sides AB and BC. Wait, AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. \n\nLaw of Cosines on angle B: \n\nAC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle B)\n\nSo 10\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + 9\u00b2 - 2*5*9*cos(angle B)\n\n100 = 25 + 81 - 90 cos(angle B)\n\n100 = 106 - 90 cos(angle B)\n\nSo 100 - 106 = -90 cos(angle B)\n\n-6 = -90 cos(angle B)\n\ncos(angle B) = 6/90 = 1/15\n\nTherefore angle B has cosine 1/15, so angle B = arccos(1/15). Hmm, okay. \n\nSimilarly, maybe compute angle at C. Let me try angle at C. \n\nLaw of Cosines on angle C:\n\nAB\u00b2 = AC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 - 2*AC*BC*cos(angle C)\n\nWait, AB is 5, AC is 10, BC is 9. \n\nSo 5\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 + 9\u00b2 - 2*10*9*cos(angle C)\n\n25 = 100 + 81 - 180 cos(angle C)\n\n25 = 181 - 180 cos(angle C)\n\n25 - 181 = -180 cos(angle C)\n\n-156 = -180 cos(angle C)\n\ncos(angle C) = 156/180 = 13/15\n\nTherefore angle C has cosine 13/15. \n\nHmm, okay. \n\nAlternatively, angle at A. Let me compute that as well. \n\nLaw of Cosines on angle A:\n\nBC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 - 2*AB*AC*cos(angle A)\n\n9\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 + 10\u00b2 - 2*5*10*cos(angle A)\n\n81 = 25 + 100 - 100 cos(angle A)\n\n81 = 125 - 100 cos(angle A)\n\n81 - 125 = -100 cos(angle A)\n\n-44 = -100 cos(angle A)\n\ncos(angle A) = 44/100 = 11/25\n\nSo angle A has cosine 11/25. \n\nHmm, okay. So now we have all the angles in terms of their cosines. \n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system with point A at (0,0), point B at (5,0), but then AC is 10, so point C would be somewhere. Wait, but then BC is 9. Let me see. \n\nWait, let me try coordinate system with point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), so that AB is along the x-axis. Let me denote coordinates as follows:\n\nLet me set point A at (0,0). Let me set point B at (5,0), since AB is 5. Then point C is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates of point C as (x,y). Then AC = 10, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100. \n\nAlso, BC = 9. The coordinates of B are (5,0), so the distance from B to C is sqrt[(x - 5)^2 + y^2] = 9, so (x - 5)^2 + y^2 = 81. \n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100\n\n2. (x - 5)^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x - 5)^2 + y^2] = 100 - 81\n\nExpand (x - 5)^2: x\u00b2 -10x +25\n\nSo x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 +10x -25 - y\u00b2 = 19\n\nSimplify: 10x -25 = 19 => 10x = 44 => x = 4.4\n\nTherefore x = 22/5 = 4.4. Then plug back into equation 1 to find y:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100 => (22/5)^2 + y\u00b2 = 100\n\n(484/25) + y\u00b2 = 100 => y\u00b2 = 100 - 484/25 = (2500 - 484)/25 = 2016/25\n\nTherefore y = sqrt(2016/25) = (sqrt(2016))/5. Let me simplify sqrt(2016):\n\n2016 = 16 * 126 = 16 * 9 * 14 = 16 * 9 * 2 *7 = so sqrt(2016) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(42) = 12 sqrt(42). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait 2016 divided by 16 is 126. 126 is 9*14, so sqrt(2016) = sqrt(16*126) = 4*sqrt(126) = 4*sqrt(9*14) = 4*3*sqrt(14) = 12\u221a14. \n\nTherefore y = 12\u221a14 /5. \n\nTherefore coordinates of point C are (22/5, 12\u221a14/5). \n\nSo coordinates:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nB: (5,0)\n\nC: (22/5, 12\u221a14/5)\n\nHmm, okay. Now, need to find the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9. The point D is the intersection of these two tangents. \n\nTo find the equations of the tangents at B and C, we can use the fact that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. \n\nFirst, we need the coordinates of the circumcenter O of triangle ABC. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute O. \n\nThe circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, let me find the perpendicular bisector of AB. Since AB is from (0,0) to (5,0), the midpoint is (2.5, 0), and the slope of AB is 0, so the perpendicular bisector is vertical line x = 2.5. \n\nNow, let's find the perpendicular bisector of AC. \n\nCoordinates of A: (0,0), coordinates of C: (22/5, 12\u221a14/5). \n\nMidpoint of AC is (11/5, 6\u221a14/5). \n\nSlope of AC is ( (12\u221a14/5 - 0)/(22/5 - 0) ) = (12\u221a14/5) / (22/5) = (12\u221a14)/22 = (6\u221a14)/11. \n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AC has slope -11/(6\u221a14). \n\nSo the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AC is:\n\ny - 6\u221a14/5 = (-11)/(6\u221a14) (x - 11/5)\n\nSimilarly, the perpendicular bisector of AB is x = 2.5 = 5/2. \n\nTherefore, the circumcenter O is at x = 5/2, and plug into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AC to find y-coordinate. \n\nLet me compute that. \n\nLet me denote x = 5/2 = 2.5. \n\nSo plug x = 5/2 into the equation:\n\ny - (6\u221a14)/5 = (-11)/(6\u221a14) * (5/2 - 11/5)\n\nFirst compute 5/2 - 11/5. Let's convert to common denominator:\n\n5/2 = 25/10, 11/5 = 22/10, so 25/10 - 22/10 = 3/10. \n\nTherefore,\n\ny - (6\u221a14)/5 = (-11)/(6\u221a14) * (3/10) \n\nMultiply the terms on the right:\n\n(-11 * 3)/(6\u221a14 * 10) = (-33)/(60\u221a14) = (-11)/(20\u221a14)\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = (6\u221a14)/5 + (-11)/(20\u221a14)\n\nHmm, need to combine these terms. Let me rationalize the denominator for the second term:\n\n(-11)/(20\u221a14) = (-11\u221a14)/(20*14) = (-11\u221a14)/280\n\nWait, but maybe better to get a common denominator. Let me see:\n\nFirst term: (6\u221a14)/5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/(5 * 56) = Hmm, perhaps better to convert both terms to have denominator 20\u221a14? Wait, maybe not. Let me compute numerically:\n\nAlternatively, let me write both terms over 20\u221a14:\n\nFirst term: (6\u221a14)/5 = (6\u221a14 * 4\u221a14)/(5 * 4\u221a14) ) Hmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me instead compute numerically:\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again:\n\nWait, the equation was:\n\ny - (6\u221a14)/5 = (-11)/(6\u221a14) * (3/10)\n\nSo the right-hand side is (-11 * 3)/(6\u221a14 * 10) = (-33)/(60\u221a14). \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, y = (6\u221a14)/5 + (-33)/(60\u221a14). \n\nTo combine these terms, let me write them with a common denominator. Let me compute the first term as (6\u221a14)/5 = (6\u221a14 * 12\u221a14)/(5 * 12\u221a14) ) Hmm, perhaps better to rationalize the second term:\n\nLet me write the second term as (-33)/(60\u221a14) = (-11)/(20\u221a14). Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14 to get:\n\n(-11\u221a14)/(20 * 14) = (-11\u221a14)/280. \n\nTherefore, y = (6\u221a14)/5 - (11\u221a14)/280. \n\nConvert (6\u221a14)/5 to denominator 280:\n\n6\u221a14 /5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/280 = (336\u221a14)/280. \n\nTherefore, y = (336\u221a14 - 11\u221a14)/280 = (325\u221a14)/280. \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n325 and 280 can both be divided by 5: 325 \u00f75 = 65, 280 \u00f75 =56. \n\nSo y = (65\u221a14)/56. \n\nTherefore, the circumcenter O has coordinates (5/2, 65\u221a14/56). \n\nHmm, okay. Now, with the circumcenter known, we can find the equations of the tangents at points B and C. \n\nThe tangent at point B (5,0) to the circle \u03c9. Since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius OB. \n\nFirst, compute the slope of OB. \n\nCoordinates of O: (5/2, 65\u221a14/56). Coordinates of B: (5,0). \n\nSlope of OB is (0 - 65\u221a14/56)/(5 - 5/2) = (-65\u221a14/56)/(5/2) = (-65\u221a14/56)*(2/5) = (-65\u221a14 * 2)/(56*5) = (-130\u221a14)/(280) = (-13\u221a14)/28. \n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal of that. \n\nSlope of tangent at B: m_tangent_B = 28/(13\u221a14). \n\nSimilarly, let me rationalize that denominator:\n\n28/(13\u221a14) = (28\u221a14)/(13*14) = (2\u221a14)/13. \n\nWait, 28 divided by 14 is 2, so yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the tangent at B has slope (2\u221a14)/13. \n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent at B is:\n\ny - 0 = (2\u221a14)/13 (x - 5)\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the tangent at point C. \n\nCoordinates of point C: (22/5, 12\u221a14/5). \n\nThe radius OC has slope (y_C - y_O)/(x_C - x_O). \n\nCompute coordinates of O: (5/2, 65\u221a14/56). \n\nCoordinates of C: (22/5, 12\u221a14/5). \n\nCompute x_C - x_O: 22/5 - 5/2 = (44/10 - 25/10) = 19/10. \n\ny_C - y_O: (12\u221a14/5 - 65\u221a14/56). Let me compute this:\n\nConvert to common denominator 280:\n\n12\u221a14/5 = (12\u221a14 * 56)/280 = (672\u221a14)/280\n\n65\u221a14/56 = (65\u221a14 *5)/280 = (325\u221a14)/280\n\nTherefore, difference is (672\u221a14 - 325\u221a14)/280 = (347\u221a14)/280. \n\nTherefore, slope of OC is (347\u221a14/280) / (19/10) = (347\u221a14/280) * (10/19) = (347\u221a14 *10)/(280*19) = (3470\u221a14)/(5320). \n\nHmm, this is getting really messy. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the tangent line at a point (x0,y0) on the circle with center (h,k):\n\nThe tangent line is (x0 - h)(x - h) + (y0 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, actually the equation of the tangent line at (x0,y0) is (x0 - h)(x - h) + (y0 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle. \n\nWait, actually, the tangent line at point (x0,y0) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 is:\n\n(x0 - h)(x - h) + (y0 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2. Wait, no, that's the equation for the tangent line? Wait, actually, the standard equation is:\n\n(x0 - h)(x - h) + (y0 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, that's the equation of the circle. Wait, perhaps I need to recall the correct formula. \n\nAlternatively, the tangent line at point (x0,y0) on the circle can be written as:\n\n(x0 - h)(x - h) + (y0 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? Hmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius, so using point-slope form. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrize the tangent line. \n\nAlternatively, since we have the slope of the tangent at B, which we found as (2\u221a14)/13, so equation is y = (2\u221a14)/13 (x -5). \n\nSimilarly, let me compute the tangent at point C. \n\nFirst, compute the slope of OC. \n\nCoordinates of O: (5/2, 65\u221a14/56)\n\nCoordinates of C: (22/5, 12\u221a14/5)\n\nSlope of OC is (y_C - y_O)/(x_C - x_O) \n\nCompute numerator:\n\n12\u221a14/5 - 65\u221a14/56 \n\nLet me compute this as:\n\nConvert to common denominator 280:\n\n12\u221a14/5 = (12\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 672\u221a14/280\n\n65\u221a14/56 = (65\u221a14 *5)/280 = 325\u221a14/280\n\nSo difference is (672\u221a14 - 325\u221a14)/280 = 347\u221a14/280\n\nDenominator:\n\nx_C - x_O = 22/5 - 5/2 = (44 - 25)/10 = 19/10\n\nTherefore, slope of OC is (347\u221a14/280) / (19/10) = (347\u221a14/280)*(10/19) = (3470\u221a14)/(5320) \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 10: 347\u221a14 / 532. \n\nHmm, 347 and 532: Let me see if they have a common factor. 532 divided by 4 is 133, 347 is a prime? Let me check 347 divided by 2, no. 3? 3*115=345, so no. 5? No. 7? 7*49=343, so 347-343=4, so no. 11? 11*31=341, 347-341=6, so no. 13? 13*26=338, 347-338=9, so no. 17? 17*20=340, 347-340=7, so no. So 347 is prime. 532 divided by 4 is 133, which is 7*19. So 532 = 4*7*19. 347 is prime, so no common factors. \n\nTherefore, slope of OC is (347\u221a14)/(532). \n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal of that. \n\nSlope of tangent at C: m = - (532)/(347\u221a14). \n\nHmm, that's a complicated slope. Let me rationalize the denominator:\n\n-532/(347\u221a14) = -532\u221a14/(347*14) = -532\u221a14/(4858). \n\nHmm, simplifying numerator and denominator by 2: -266\u221a14 / 2429. \n\nWait, 532 divided by 2 is 266, 4858 divided by 2 is 2429. \n\nHmm, 2429 divided by 7? 7*347 is 2429? 7*300=2100, 7*47=329, so 2100+329=2429. Yes, so 2429 = 7*347. \n\nTherefore, -266\u221a14/(7*347) = (-266/7)*(\u221a14)/347 = (-38)*(\u221a14)/347. \n\nTherefore, slope of tangent at C is -38\u221a14 / 347. \n\nHmm, okay. \n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent at C is:\n\ny - (12\u221a14/5) = (-38\u221a14/347)(x - 22/5)\n\nThis is getting really messy. Maybe there's a better approach here. \n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for points A, B, C, and O, perhaps we can compute the coordinates of point D by finding the intersection of the two tangent lines. \n\nWe have the equations of the two tangents:\n\n1. Tangent at B: y = (2\u221a14)/13 (x -5)\n\n2. Tangent at C: y - (12\u221a14/5) = (-38\u221a14/347)(x - 22/5)\n\nThis seems very algebra-heavy, but let's try to proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, let me write both equations in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) so that we can solve for their intersection. \n\nFirst tangent at B is already in slope-intercept form:\n\ny = (2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13\n\nSecond tangent at C:\n\nLet me expand the equation:\n\ny = (-38\u221a14/347)(x - 22/5) + 12\u221a14/5\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (-38\u221a14/347)x + (38\u221a14/347)*(22/5)\n\nSecond term: 12\u221a14/5\n\nTherefore, combining terms:\n\ny = (-38\u221a14/347)x + (38\u221a14 *22)/(347*5) + 12\u221a14/5\n\nLet me compute the constants:\n\nFirst constant term: (38*22)/(347*5) * \u221a14 = (836)/(1735)\u221a14\n\nSecond constant term: 12\u221a14/5 = (12\u221a14 * 347)/(5*347) = (4164\u221a14)/1735\n\nWait, actually, to combine the constants, they need a common denominator. Let me see:\n\nFirst constant term: 836/(1735)\u221a14\n\nSecond constant term: 12\u221a14/5 = (12\u221a14 * 347)/ (5 * 347) ) = (4164\u221a14)/1735\n\nTherefore, total constant term:\n\n(836 + 4164)/1735 * \u221a14 = (5000/1735)\u221a14. Wait, 836 + 4164 is 5000? Let me check:\n\n836 + 4164: 800 + 4100 = 4900, 36 + 64 = 100, so total 5000. Yes. \n\nTherefore, the constant term is (5000/1735)\u221a14. Simplify 5000/1735:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 1000/347. \n\nTherefore, the equation of tangent at C is:\n\ny = (-38\u221a14/347)x + (1000\u221a14)/347\n\nTherefore, the two tangent lines are:\n\n1. y = (2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13\n\n2. y = (-38\u221a14/347)x + (1000\u221a14)/347\n\nNow, to find point D, we need to solve these two equations for x and y. \n\nSet the two expressions for y equal:\n\n(2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13 = (-38\u221a14/347)x + (1000\u221a14)/347\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 from all terms:\n\n\u221a14 [ (2/13)x - 10/13 + (38/347)x - 1000/347 ] = 0\n\nWait, actually, moving all terms to the left side:\n\n(2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13 + (38\u221a14/347)x - (1000\u221a14)/347 = 0\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (2/13 + 38/347)x - (10/13 + 1000/347) ] = 0\n\nSince \u221a14 \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by \u221a14:\n\n(2/13 + 38/347)x - (10/13 + 1000/347) = 0\n\nNow, compute the coefficients:\n\nFirst, compute the coefficient of x:\n\n2/13 + 38/347. Let me find a common denominator, which is 13*347 = 4511.\n\n2/13 = (2*347)/4511 = 694/4511\n\n38/347 = (38*13)/4511 = 494/4511\n\nTherefore, total: (694 + 494)/4511 = 1188/4511\n\nSecond term: 10/13 + 1000/347. Again common denominator 4511.\n\n10/13 = (10*347)/4511 = 3470/4511\n\n1000/347 = (1000*13)/4511 = 13000/4511\n\nTotal: (3470 + 13000)/4511 = 16470/4511\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(1188/4511)x - 16470/4511 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4511:\n\n1188x - 16470 = 0\n\nTherefore, 1188x = 16470\n\nx = 16470 / 1188\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n16470 \u00f76 = 2745\n\n1188 \u00f76 = 198\n\nSo x = 2745 / 198\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n2745 \u00f73 = 915\n\n198 \u00f73 = 66\n\nx = 915 /66\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n915 \u00f73 = 305\n\n66 \u00f73 = 22\n\nSo x = 305/22 \u2248 13.8636...\n\nHmm, okay. \n\nNow, plug x back into one of the equations to find y. Let me use the first tangent equation:\n\ny = (2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13\n\nPlugging x = 305/22:\n\ny = (2\u221a14/13)(305/22) - (10\u221a14)/13\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (2*305)/(13*22) \u221a14 = (610)/(286) \u221a14 = (305/143)\u221a14\n\nSecond term: -10/13 \u221a14 = (-1430/1859)\u221a14? Wait, better to get common denominator with first term. \n\nWait, let me write both terms over 286 denominator:\n\nFirst term: 305/143 \u221a14 = (305*2)/(286) \u221a14 = 610/286 \u221a14\n\nSecond term: -10/13 \u221a14 = (-10*22)/286 \u221a14 = -220/286 \u221a14\n\nTherefore, total y = (610 - 220)/286 \u221a14 = 390/286 \u221a14\n\nSimplify 390/286: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 195/143. \n\nTherefore, y = (195/143)\u221a14\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (305/22, 195\u221a14/143). \n\nOkay, so now we have coordinates for point D. \n\nNow, we need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A (0,0) to D (305/22, 195\u221a14/143). \n\nThe parametric equations for line AD can be written as:\n\nx = (305/22)*t\n\ny = (195\u221a14/143)*t\n\nWhere t ranges from 0 to 1 to go from A to D, and beyond to P. \n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9. Since A is already on the circle, P is the other intersection. \n\nThe equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 can be written using the coordinates of A, B, C. Alternatively, since we know the center O and radius R, we can write the equation. \n\nCoordinates of O are (5/2, 65\u221a14/56). The radius squared R\u00b2 is the distance from O to A squared. \n\nCompute OA\u00b2:\n\n(5/2 - 0)^2 + (65\u221a14/56 - 0)^2 \n\n= (25/4) + ( (65\u221a14)^2 )/(56^2 )\n\nCompute (65\u221a14)^2 = 65\u00b2 *14 = 4225 *14 = 59150\n\nWait, 65 squared is 4225, yes. 4225 *14: 4225*10=42250, 4225*4=16900, total 59150. \n\nThen 59150 divided by (56^2). 56 squared is 3136. \n\nSo OA\u00b2 = 25/4 + 59150/3136 \n\nConvert 25/4 to denominator 3136: 25/4 = (25*784)/3136 = 19600/3136\n\nTherefore OA\u00b2 = (19600 + 59150)/3136 = 78750/3136 \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 2: 39375/1568. \n\nHmm, okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to write the equation of the circle in standard form. \n\nThe general equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R\u00b2, where (h,k) is the center. \n\nSo plugging in h = 5/2, k = 65\u221a14/56, and R\u00b2 = OA\u00b2 = 78750/3136. \n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n(x - 5/2)^2 + (y - 65\u221a14/56)^2 = 78750/3136\n\nNow, we can substitute the parametric equations of line AD into this equation to find the parameter t where the line intersects the circle again (other than at A, which is t=0). \n\nSubstitute x = (305/22)t and y = (195\u221a14/143)t into the circle equation:\n\n[ (305/22 t - 5/2)^2 + ( (195\u221a14/143 t) - 65\u221a14/56 )^2 ] = 78750/3136\n\nThis looks very complicated, but let's try to compute each term step by step. \n\nFirst term: (305/22 t - 5/2)^2\n\nLet me write 5/2 as (55/22) to have the same denominator as 305/22:\n\nWait, 5/2 = (5 * 11)/ (2 *11) = 55/22. Wait, 5/2 = 55/22? 55 divided by 22 is 2.5, yes. \n\nTherefore, 305/22 t - 55/22 = (305t -55)/22\n\nTherefore, first term squared is [(305t -55)/22]^2 = (305t -55)^2 / (22)^2\n\nSecond term: [ (195\u221a14/143 t) - 65\u221a14/56 ]^2\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (195/143 t) - 65/56 ] \n\nTherefore, the term squared is 14 * [ (195/143 t - 65/56 ) ]^2\n\nTherefore, the entire equation becomes:\n\n(305t -55)^2 / (22)^2 + 14*(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 = 78750/3136\n\nThis is going to be very algebra intensive. Let me see if there's a smarter way. \n\nAlternatively, since we know that point A is on both the line and the circle, so when we substitute the parametric equations into the circle equation, we can factor out (t - 0), and the other solution will correspond to point P. \n\nLet me denote the equation as a quadratic in t. Let me write it out:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me compute each term step by step. \n\nFirst term expansion:\n\n[(305t -55)/22]^2 = (305t -55)^2 / 484\n\nSecond term:\n\n14*( (195/143 t - 65/56 )^2 )\n\nLet me compute (195/143 t - 65/56):\n\nLet me write both terms with a common denominator. Let me see denominators 143 and 56. \n\n143 factors into 11*13, 56 is 7*8. So LCM is 143*56 = 8008. \n\nBut maybe better to compute numerically:\n\nLet me compute 195/143 t - 65/56:\n\nLet me write as:\n\n(195/143)t - (65/56) = (195/143)t - (65/56)\n\nLet me factor out 65:\n\n65*( (3/143)t - 1/56 )\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute the square:\n\n(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 = [ (195/143 t)^2 - 2*(195/143)*(65/56) t + (65/56)^2 ]\n\nMultiply by 14:\n\n14*(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 = 14*( (195/143)^2 t\u00b2 - 2*(195/143)*(65/56) t + (65/56)^2 )\n\nTherefore, the entire left-hand side of the equation is:\n\n(305t -55)^2 / 484 + 14*( (195/143)^2 t\u00b2 - 2*(195/143)*(65/56) t + (65/56)^2 ) = 78750/3136\n\nThis is going to be a quadratic equation in t. Let me denote the left-hand side as A t\u00b2 + B t + C, and set equal to 78750/3136. \n\nBut since when t=0, the point is A, which is on the circle, so plugging t=0 into the left-hand side should give the same as the right-hand side? Wait no, because the right-hand side is the radius squared, but when t=0, the left-hand side would be the equation evaluated at A, which is on the circle, so it should equal R\u00b2. Wait, but in our equation, we have the left-hand side equal to R\u00b2. Wait, actually, the equation is set equal to R\u00b2, so when t=0, the left-hand side is indeed R\u00b2, so the equation is satisfied. Therefore, t=0 is a solution, and the other solution corresponds to point P. \n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation will have roots at t=0 and t = t_p (the parameter for point P). \n\nTherefore, if we can write the equation as (quadratic) = 0, then the product of the roots is C/A, and since one root is 0, the other root is -B/A or something? Wait, let me think. \n\nWait, actually, let me rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n\nLeft side - Right side = 0:\n\n[(305t -55)^2 / 484 + 14*(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 ] - 78750/3136 = 0\n\nLet me denote this as A t\u00b2 + B t + C = 0. \n\nSince t=0 is a root, then plugging t=0 gives:\n\n[ ( -55)^2 /484 + 14*( -65/56 )^2 ] - 78750/3136 = 0 ?\n\nWait, but that must be true because point A is on the circle. Let me verify:\n\nCompute first term at t=0: ( -55 )\u00b2 /484 = 3025 /484\n\nSecond term: 14*( -65/56 )\u00b2 = 14*(4225/3136) = (14*4225)/3136 = 59150/3136\n\nTotal left side terms: 3025/484 + 59150/3136 \n\nConvert 3025/484 to denominator 3136:\n\n484 = 22\u00b2 = 4*121, 3136 = 56\u00b2 = 4*784. \n\n3025/484 = (3025 * 784)/(484 * 784) = but this might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, compute numerically:\n\n3025 /484 \u2248 6.25 (since 484*6 = 2904, 484*6.25 = 484*(25/4) = 484*6.25 = 3025). \n\nSimilarly, 59150 /3136 \u2248 18.86 (since 3136*18 = 56448, 3136*18.86 \u2248 59150). \n\nSo total left side terms \u2248 6.25 + 18.86 \u2248 25.11, and 78750/3136 \u2248 25.11. \n\nTherefore, yes, it works. \n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation will have t=0 as a root, and the other root t_p can be found by Vieta's formula. \n\nThe quadratic equation is A t\u00b2 + B t + C = 0, with roots t=0 and t = t_p. \n\nTherefore, the product of the roots is C/A = 0 * t_p = 0, so C must be 0? Wait, no, Vieta's formula says that the product is C/A, but since one root is 0, then C must be 0. Wait, but in our case, when we subtract 78750/3136, the constant term becomes C = (original constant terms) - 78750/3136, which is zero. \n\nWait, actually, let me think again. \n\nLet me denote the equation as:\n\nLeft Side (LS) = Right Side (RS)\n\nSo LS - RS = 0 is the equation. \n\nLS is [(305t -55)^2 /484 + 14*(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 ]\n\nRS is 78750/3136\n\nTherefore, LS - RS = 0 is the equation. \n\nTherefore, expanding LS:\n\nFirst term: (305t -55)^2 /484 \n\nLet me expand (305t -55)^2:\n\n= (305t)^2 - 2*305*55 t + 55\u00b2 \n\n= 93025 t\u00b2 - 33550 t + 3025 \n\nDivide by 484:\n\n= (93025/484) t\u00b2 - (33550/484) t + (3025/484)\n\nSecond term: 14*(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 \n\nFirst compute (195/143 t - 65/56)^2:\n\n= (195/143 t)^2 - 2*(195/143)*(65/56) t + (65/56)^2 \n\nMultiply by 14:\n\n= 14*( (195/143)^2 t\u00b2 - 2*(195/143)*(65/56) t + (65/56)^2 )\n\nCompute each coefficient:\n\nFirst term: 14*(195/143)^2 \n\nSecond term: -14*2*(195/143)*(65/56) \n\nThird term: 14*(65/56)^2 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term coefficient:\n\n14*(195\u00b2)/(143\u00b2) \n\nSecond term coefficient:\n\n-28*(195*65)/(143*56)\n\nThird term:\n\n14*(65\u00b2)/(56\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, the entire second term becomes:\n\n[14*(195\u00b2)/143\u00b2] t\u00b2 + [ -28*(195*65)/(143*56) ] t + [14*(65\u00b2)/56\u00b2 ]\n\nTherefore, combining both terms (first term and second term) in LS - RS =0:\n\nTotal equation:\n\n[ (93025/484 + 14*(195\u00b2)/143\u00b2 ) t\u00b2 \n\n+ ( -33550/484 - 28*(195*65)/(143*56) ) t \n\n+ (3025/484 + 14*(65\u00b2)/56\u00b2 - 78750/3136 ) ] = 0\n\nThis is extremely tedious, but let me compute each coefficient step by step. \n\nFirst, compute the coefficient of t\u00b2:\n\nTerm1: 93025 /484 \n\nTerm2: 14*(195\u00b2)/143\u00b2 \n\nCompute Term1:\n\n93025 /484. Let me see, 484 is 22\u00b2, 93025 divided by 484. Let me see 484*192 = 484*(200 -8) = 96800 - 3872 = 92928. So 93025 - 92928 = 97. So 93025/484 = 192 + 97/484 \u2248 192.2. \n\nBut exact fraction: 93025/484. Let me see if 484 divides into 93025. 484*192 = 92928, remainder 97. So 93025/484 = 192 + 97/484. \n\nTerm2: 14*(195\u00b2)/143\u00b2 \n\n195\u00b2 = 38025, 143\u00b2 = 20449. \n\nSo Term2 = 14*38025 /20449 = 532350 /20449 \n\nTherefore, total t\u00b2 coefficient:\n\n93025/484 + 532350/20449 \n\nTo add these, need common denominator. Let me see 484 and 20449. \n\nNote that 143 is 11*13, so 143\u00b2 = (11*13)^2 = 121*169 = 20449. \n\n484 is 22\u00b2 = (2*11)^2 = 4*121. \n\nTherefore, 484 = 4*121, and 20449 = 121*169. \n\nTherefore, LCM of 484 and 20449 is 4*121*169 = 4*20449. \n\nWait, 484 = 4*121, 20449 = 121*169. So LCM is 4*121*169. \n\nTherefore, convert each term:\n\nFirst term: (93025/484) = (93025 * 169)/(4*121*169) \n\nSecond term: (532350/20449) = (532350 *4)/(4*121*169)\n\nCompute numerators:\n\nFirst term numerator: 93025 *169. Let me compute 93025 * 100 = 9,302,500; 93025 * 60 = 5,581,500; 93025 *9 = 837,225. So total 9,302,500 +5,581,500 = 14,884,000 +837,225 = 15,721,225. \n\nSecond term numerator: 532,350 *4 = 2,129,400 \n\nTherefore total numerator for t\u00b2 coefficient:\n\n15,721,225 + 2,129,400 = 17,850,625 \n\nDenominator: 4*121*169 = 4*20449 = 81,796 \n\nTherefore, t\u00b2 coefficient is 17,850,625 /81,796 \n\nHmm, that's a big fraction. Let me see if it can be simplified. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(17,850,625, 81,796). Let me see:\n\nFirst, factor denominator 81,796. Let's divide by 4: 81,796 /4 = 20,449, which is 143\u00b2. \n\nSo denominator is 4*143\u00b2. \n\nNumerator: 17,850,625. Let me see if divisible by 143. \n\n143*125,000 = 17,875,000 which is larger than numerator. \n\n143*124,800 = 143*(125,000 - 200) = 17,875,000 - 28,600 = 17,846,400 \n\nSubtract from numerator: 17,850,625 -17,846,400 = 4,225 \n\n4,225 divided by 143: 143*29 = 4,147, remainder 78. Not divisible. \n\nHmm, maybe not. Let me check if numerator is divisible by 25: yes, ends with 25. \n\n17,850,625 \u00f725 = 714,025 \n\nDenominator 81,796 \u00f74 =20,449. \n\nSo 714,025 /20,449. Let me see if 20,449 divides into 714,025. \n\n20,449 *35 = 20,449*30 +20,449*5 = 613,470 +102,245 = 715,715 which is more than 714,025. \n\nSo 34*20,449 = 20,449*30 +20,449*4 = 613,470 +81,796 = 695,266 \n\n714,025 -695,266 = 18,759 \n\nNot divisible. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, since we know that the product of the roots is C/A, and one root is 0, so the other root is -B/A. Wait, Vieta's formula says that for equation At\u00b2 + Bt + C =0, the product is C/A and sum is -B/A. Since one root is 0, then the other root is -B/A. \n\nWait, actually, if the roots are t1 and t2, then t1 + t2 = -B/A and t1*t2 = C/A. If one root is 0, then t2 = -B/A and C/A =0. \n\nTherefore, the non-zero root is t_p = -B/A. \n\nTherefore, if I can compute coefficients A and B, then t_p = -B/A. \n\nLet me try to compute coefficients A and B. \n\nFirst, coefficient A (coefficient of t\u00b2):\n\nA = 93025/484 + 14*(195/143)^2 \n\nLet me compute 14*(195/143)^2:\n\n14*(195\u00b2)/(143\u00b2) = 14*(38025)/20449 = 532,350 /20,449 \n\nSo A = 93,025/484 + 532,350/20,449 \n\nConvert 93,025/484 to denominator 20,449:\n\nSince 484 = 4*121, and 20,449 = 143\u00b2 = (11*13)^2 = 121*169. \n\nTherefore, 484 = 4*121, so 20,449 = 121*169. \n\nTherefore, 93,025/484 = (93,025 /4) * (1/121) \n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 93,025/484 = (93,025 \u00f7 121) / (484 \u00f7121) = (769)/4 \n\nWait, 121*769 = 121*(700 +69) = 84,700 + 8,349 = 93,049. Hmm, close but not exact. \n\nWait, 121*769 = 121*(700 + 60 +9) = 121*700=84,700; 121*60=7,260; 121*9=1,089. Total: 84,700 +7,260 = 91,960 +1,089 = 93,049. \n\nBut numerator is 93,025, so 93,025 = 93,049 -24. \n\nHmm, so 93,025/484 = (93,049 -24)/484 = (121*769 -24)/ (4*121) \n\nThis might not help. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute numerically:\n\n93,025 /484 \u2248 93,025 \u00f7 484 \u2248 192.2 (since 484*192 = 92,928, so 93,025 -92,928 =97, so 192 + 97/484 \u2248192.2)\n\nSimilarly, 532,350 /20,449 \u2248532,350 \u00f720,449 \u224826.04 (since 20,449*26 = 531,674, so 532,350 -531,674 =676, so 26 + 676/20,449 \u224826.033)\n\nTherefore, A \u2248192.2 +26.033\u2248218.233\n\nNow coefficient B (coefficient of t):\n\nB = -33,550/484 -28*(195*65)/(143*56)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -33,550 /484 \u2248-33,550 \u00f7484 \u2248-69.318 (since 484*69 = 33,476, so 33,550 -33,476=74, so -69 -74/484\u2248-69.153)\n\nSecond term: -28*(195*65)/(143*56)\n\nCompute numerator: 28*195*65 \n\n28*195 = 5,460; 5,460*65 = 354,900 \n\nDenominator:143*56 = 8,008 \n\nTherefore, the second term is -354,900 /8,008 \u2248-44.32 (since 8,008*44 = 352,352; 354,900 -352,352=2,548; 2,548/8,008\u22480.318, so total\u2248-44.318)\n\nTherefore total B \u2248-69.153 -44.318\u2248-113.471\n\nTherefore, t_p = -B/A \u2248 -(-113.471)/218.233\u2248113.471/218.233\u22480.52. \n\nHmm, so approximately t_p \u22480.52. \n\nWait, but this is an approximate value. However, since we need an exact value, perhaps there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, recall that Power of a Point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. \n\nWe can compute DA and then DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD + DP? Wait, need to clarify the direction. \n\nWait, point D is outside the circle, line AD passes through A (on the circle) and goes to D, then extends to P on the circle again. So the points are ordered A, D, P along the line. Therefore, AP = AD + DP. \n\nBut according to Power of a Point, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nLet me denote DA as the length from D to A, and DP as the length from D to P. Since P is on the opposite side of D from A, then DP = DA + AP? Wait, no. Wait, if A is on the circle, D is outside, then the line AD goes from A through D to P. Wait, actually, the order is A---P---D? Or A---D---P? \n\nWait, need to clarify the order. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, which are outside the circle, so D is outside the circle. The line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), and then P is the second intersection with the circle. Therefore, the points are ordered A, then D, then P. Wait, but if you go from A through D, then P would be beyond D from A. But since D is outside, then P must be on the other side of D from A? Wait, no, actually, if you start at A, go through D (outside), then the other intersection P must be on the extension beyond D. \n\nWait, but in that case, AP would be AD + DP. \n\nBut according to Power of a Point, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nPower of a Point D with respect to circle \u03c9 is equal to the square of the tangent from D to \u03c9, which is DB\u00b2 (since DB is tangent). \n\nAlso, Power of D is equal to DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P along the line. \n\nBut since A is on the circle, DA is just the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. Since P is on the opposite side of D from A, then DP = DA + AP? Wait, no. Wait, if the points are A---D---P, then AP = AD + DP. But in terms of directed lengths, if we consider DA as positive in the direction from D to A, then DP would be negative, but in Power of a Point, it's the product of the lengths, so absolute values. \n\nAlternatively, using signed lengths, if we take DA as negative (since direction from D to A is opposite to the direction towards P), then DA * DP = - |DA| * |DP| = - (DA * DP). But Power of a Point is DA * DP = DB\u00b2, so actually, the formula is |DA| * |DP| = DB\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, if we let DA be the length from D to A, and DP be the length from D to P, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, AP = AD + DP? Wait, if the points are A---D---P, then AP = AD + DP. But AD is the distance from A to D, and DP is from D to P, so yes, AP = AD + DP. \n\nTherefore, AP = AD + DP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA). \n\nTherefore, AP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA) = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/DA \n\nTherefore, if I can compute AD and DB, then I can compute AP. \n\nThis seems promising. Let me try this approach. \n\nFirst, compute DB. Since DB is the length of the tangent from D to the circle at point B. \n\nBut since D lies on the tangent at B, DB is indeed the tangent length, so DB is just the length from D to B. \n\nWait, yes, because the tangent at B has length DB. \n\nTherefore, DB is the distance between D and B. \n\nSimilarly, DC is the distance between D and C, which should be equal to DB. \n\nWait, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so DB = DC. \n\nTherefore, we can compute DB as the distance between D and B. \n\nWe have coordinates for D and B, so let's compute DB. \n\nCoordinates of D: (305/22, 195\u221a14/143)\n\nCoordinates of B: (5,0)\n\nCompute the distance between them:\n\n\u0394x = 305/22 -5 = 305/22 - 110/22 = 195/22\n\n\u0394y = 195\u221a14/143 -0 = 195\u221a14/143\n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2 = (195/22)^2 + (195\u221a14/143)^2 \n\nFactor out (195)^2:\n\nDB\u00b2 = (195)^2 [ (1/22)^2 + ( (\u221a14)/143 )^2 ]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n(1/22)^2 + (14)/(143)^2 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1/(22)^2 = 1/484\n\n14/(143)^2 =14/(20449)\n\nTherefore, total inside the brackets:\n\n1/484 +14/20449 \n\nFind common denominator, which is 484*20449. \n\nBut let me compute numerically:\n\n1/484 \u22480.002066\n\n14/20449\u22480.0006846\n\nTotal\u22480.002066 +0.0006846\u22480.0027506\n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2 \u2248 (195)^2 *0.0027506 \n\n195\u00b2 = 38,025 \n\n38,025 *0.0027506 \u224838,025 *0.00275 \u224838,025 *0.002 +38,025*0.00075 \n\n=76.05 +28.51875\u2248104.56875 \n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2\u2248104.56875 \n\nBut let me compute exactly:\n\nCompute 1/484 +14/20449:\n\nConvert to common denominator 484*20449:\n\n= (20449 +14*484)/(484*20449)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20449 +14*484 =20449 +6,776 =27,225 \n\nTherefore, the bracket term"

Let me denote coordinates of point C as (x,y). Then AC = 10, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100. \n\nAlso, BC = 9. The coordinates of B are (5,0), so the distance from B to C is sqrt[(x - 5)^2 + y^2] = 9, so (x - 5)^2 + y^2 = 81. \n\nSo we have two equations:\n\n1. x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100\n\n2. (x - 5)^2 + y^2 = 81\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x - 5)^2 + y^2] = 100 - 81\n\nExpand (x - 5)^2: x\u00b2 -10x +25\n\nSo x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 +10x -25 - y\u00b2 = 19\n\nSimplify: 10x -25 = 19 => 10x = 44 => x = 4.4\n\nTherefore x = 22/5 = 4.4.

Let me compute numerically:\n\nAlternatively, let me write both terms over 20\u221a14:\n\nFirst term: (6\u221a14)/5 = (6\u221a14 * 4\u221a14)/(5 * 4\u221a14) ) Hmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me instead compute numerically:\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again:\n\nWait, the equation was:\n\ny - (6\u221a14)/5 = (-11)/(6\u221a14) * (3/10)\n\nSo the right-hand side is (-11 * 3)/(6\u221a14 * 10) = (-33)/(60\u221a14). \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, y = (6\u221a14)/5 + (-33)/(60\u221a14). \n\nTo combine these terms, let me write them with a common denominator. Let me compute the first term as (6\u221a14)/5 = (6\u221a14 * 12\u221a14)/(5 * 12\u221a14) ) Hmm, perhaps better to rationalize the second term:\n\nLet me write the second term as (-33)/(60\u221a14) = (-11)/(20\u221a14). Multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14 to get:\n\n(-11\u221a14)/(20 * 14) = (-11\u221a14)/280. \n\nTherefore, y = (6\u221a14)/5 - (11\u221a14)/280. \n\nConvert (6\u221a14)/5 to denominator 280:\n\n6\u221a14 /5 = (6\u221a14 * 56)/280 = (336\u221a14)/280. \n\nTherefore, y = (336\u221a14 - 11\u221a14)/280 = (325\u221a14)/280. \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n325 and 280 can both be divided by 5: 325 \u00f75 = 65, 280 \u00f75 =56. \n\nSo y = (65\u221a14)/56. \n\nTherefore, the circumcenter O has coordinates (5/2, 65\u221a14/56). \n\n",

Hmm, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the tangent line is perpendicular to the radius, so using point-slope form. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrize the tangent line. \n\nAlternatively, since we have the slope of the tangent at B, which we found as (2\u221a14)/13, so equation is y = (2\u221a14)/13 (x -5). \n\nSimilarly, let me compute the tangent at point C. \n\nFirst, compute the slope of OC. \n\nCoordinates of O: (5/2, 65\u221a14/56)\n\nCoordinates of C: (22/5, 12\u221a14/5)\n\nSlope of OC is (y_C - y_O)/(x_C - x_O) \n\nCompute numerator:\n\n12\u221a14/5 - 65\u221a14/56 \n\nLet me compute this as:\n\nConvert to common denominator 280:\n\n12\u221a14/5 = (12\u221a14 * 56)/280 = 672\u221a14/280\n\n65\u221a14/56 = (65\u221a14 *5)/280 = 325\u221a14/280\n\nSo difference is (672\u221a14 - 325\u221a14)/280 = 347\u221a14/280\n\nDenominator:\n\nx_C - x_O = 22/5 - 5/2 = (44 - 25)/10 = 19/10\n\nTherefore, slope of OC is (347\u221a14/280) / (19/10) = (347\u221a14/280)*(10/19) = (3470\u221a14)/(5320) \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 10: 347\u221a14 / 532. \n\nHmm, 347 and 532: Let me see if they have a common factor. 532 divided by 4 is 133, 347 is a prime? Let me check 347 divided by 2, no. 3? 3*115=345, so no. 5? No. 7? 7*49=343, so 347-343=4, so no. 11? 11*31=341, 347-341=6, so no. 13? 13*26=338, 347-338=9, so no. 17? 17*20=340, 347-340=7, so no.

Simplify 5000/1735:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 1000/347. \n\nTherefore, the equation of tangent at C is:\n\ny = (-38\u221a14/347)x + (1000\u221a14)/347\n\nTherefore, the two tangent lines are:\n\n1. y = (2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13\n\n2. y = (-38\u221a14/347)x + (1000\u221a14)/347\n\nNow, to find point D, we need to solve these two equations for x and y. \n\nSet the two expressions for y equal:\n\n(2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13 = (-38\u221a14/347)x + (1000\u221a14)/347\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 from all terms:\n\n\u221a14 [ (2/13)x - 10/13 + (38/347)x - 1000/347 ] = 0\n\nWait, actually, moving all terms to the left side:\n\n(2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13 + (38\u221a14/347)x - (1000\u221a14)/347 = 0\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14 [ (2/13 + 38/347)x - (10/13 + 1000/347) ] = 0\n\nSince \u221a14 \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by \u221a14:\n\n(2/13 + 38/347)x - (10/13 + 1000/347) = 0\n\nNow, compute the coefficients:\n\nFirst, compute the coefficient of x:\n\n2/13 + 38/347. Let me find a common denominator, which is 13*347 = 4511.\n\n2/13 = (2*347)/4511 = 694/4511\n\n38/347 = (38*13)/4511 = 494/4511\n\nTherefore, total: (694 + 494)/4511 = 1188/4511\n\nSecond term: 10/13 + 1000/347. Again common denominator 4511.\n\n10/13 = (10*347)/4511 = 3470/4511\n\n1000/347 = (1000*13)/4511 = 13000/4511\n\nTotal: (3470 + 13000)/4511 = 16470/4511\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(1188/4511)x - 16470/4511 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4511:\n\n1188x - 16470 = 0\n\nTherefore, 1188x = 16470\n\nx = 16470 / 1188\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6:\n\n16470 \u00f76 = 2745\n\n1188 \u00f76 = 198\n\nSo x = 2745 / 198\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n2745 \u00f73 = 915\n\n198 \u00f73 = 66\n\nx = 915 /66\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n915 \u00f73 = 305\n\n66 \u00f73 = 22\n\nSo x = 305/22 \u2248 13.8636...\n\nHmm, okay. \n\nNow, plug x back into one of the equations to find y. Let me use the first tangent equation:\n\ny = (2\u221a14/13)x - (10\u221a14)/13\n\nPlugging x = 305/22:\n\ny = (2\u221a14/13)(305/22) - (10\u221a14)/13\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (2*305)/(13*22) \u221a14 = (610)/(286) \u221a14 = (305/143)\u221a14\n\nSecond term: -10/13 \u221a14 = (-1430/1859)\u221a14? Wait, better to get common denominator with first term. \n\nWait, let me write both terms over 286 denominator:\n\nFirst term: 305/143 \u221a14 = (305*2)/(286) \u221a14 = 610/286 \u221a14\n\nSecond term: -10/13 \u221a14 = (-10*22)/286 \u221a14 = -220/286 \u221a14\n\nTherefore, total y = (610 - 220)/286 \u221a14 = 390/286 \u221a14\n\nSimplify 390/286: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 195/143. \n\nTherefore, y = (195/143)\u221a14\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (305/22, 195\u221a14/143). \n\n",

Let me denote the left-hand side as A t\u00b2 + B t + C, and set equal to 78750/3136. \n\nBut since when t=0, the point is A, which is on the circle, so plugging t=0 into the left-hand side should give the same as the right-hand side? Wait no, because the right-hand side is the radius squared, but when t=0, the left-hand side would be the equation evaluated at A, which is on the circle, so it should equal R\u00b2. Wait, but in our equation, we have the left-hand side equal to R\u00b2. Wait, actually, the equation is set equal to R\u00b2, so when t=0, the left-hand side is indeed R\u00b2, so the equation is satisfied. Therefore, t=0 is a solution, and the other solution corresponds to point P. \n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation will have roots at t=0 and t = t_p (the parameter for point P). \n\nTherefore, if we can write the equation as (quadratic) = 0, then the product of the roots is C/A, and since one root is 0, the other root is -B/A or something? Wait, let me think. \n\nWait, actually, let me rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:\n\nLeft side - Right side = 0:\n\n[(305t -55)^2 / 484 + 14*(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 ] - 78750/3136 = 0\n\nLet me denote this as A t\u00b2 + B t + C = 0. \n\nSince t=0 is a root, then plugging t=0 gives:\n\n[ ( -55)^2 /484 + 14*( -65/56 )^2 ] - 78750/3136 = 0 ?\n\nWait, but that must be true because point A is on the circle. Let me verify:\n\nCompute first term at t=0: ( -55 )\u00b2 /484 = 3025 /484\n\nSecond term: 14*( -65/56 )\u00b2 = 14*(4225/3136) = (14*4225)/3136 = 59150/3136\n\nTotal left side terms: 3025/484 + 59150/3136 \n\nConvert 3025/484 to denominator 3136:\n\n484 = 22\u00b2 = 4*121, 3136 = 56\u00b2 = 4*784. \n\n3025/484 = (3025 * 784)/(484 * 784) = but this might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, compute numerically:\n\n3025 /484 \u2248 6.25 (since 484*6 = 2904, 484*6.25 = 484*(25/4) = 484*6.25 = 3025). \n\nSimilarly, 59150 /3136 \u2248 18.86 (since 3136*18 = 56448, 3136*18.86 \u2248 59150). \n\nSo total left side terms \u2248 6.25 + 18.86 \u2248 25.11, and 78750/3136 \u2248 25.11. \n\nTherefore, yes, it works. \n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation will have t=0 as a root, and the other root t_p can be found by Vieta's formula. \n\nThe quadratic equation is A t\u00b2 + B t + C = 0, with roots t=0 and t = t_p. \n\nTherefore, the product of the roots is C/A = 0 * t_p = 0, so C must be 0? Wait, no, Vieta's formula says that the product is C/A, but since one root is 0, then C must be 0. Wait, but in our case, when we subtract 78750/3136, the constant term becomes C = (original constant terms) - 78750/3136, which is zero. \n\nWait, actually, let me think again. \n\nLet me denote the equation as:\n\nLeft Side (LS) = Right Side (RS)\n\nSo LS - RS = 0 is the equation. \n\nLS is [(305t -55)^2 /484 + 14*(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 ]\n\nRS is 78750/3136\n\nTherefore, LS - RS = 0 is the equation. \n\nTherefore, expanding LS:\n\nFirst term: (305t -55)^2 /484 \n\nLet me expand (305t -55)^2:\n\n= (305t)^2 - 2*305*55 t + 55\u00b2 \n\n= 93025 t\u00b2 - 33550 t + 3025 \n\nDivide by 484:\n\n= (93025/484) t\u00b2 - (33550/484) t + (3025/484)\n\nSecond term: 14*(195/143 t - 65/56)^2 \n\nFirst compute (195/143 t - 65/56)^2:\n\n= (195/143 t)^2 - 2*(195/143)*(65/56) t + (65/56)^2 \n\nMultiply by 14:\n\n= 14*( (195/143)^2 t\u00b2 - 2*(195/143)*(65/56) t + (65/56)^2 )\n\nCompute each coefficient:\n\nFirst term: 14*(195/143)^2 \n\nSecond term: -14*2*(195/143)*(65/56) \n\nThird term: 14*(65/56)^2 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term coefficient:\n\n14*(195\u00b2)/(143\u00b2) \n\nSecond term coefficient:\n\n-28*(195*65)/(143*56)\n\nThird term:\n\n14*(65\u00b2)/(56\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, the entire second term becomes:\n\n[14*(195\u00b2)/143\u00b2] t\u00b2 + [ -28*(195*65)/(143*56) ] t + [14*(65\u00b2)/56\u00b2 ]\n\nTherefore, combining both terms (first term and second term) in LS - RS =0:\n\nTotal equation:\n\n[ (93025/484 + 14*(195\u00b2)/143\u00b2 ) t\u00b2 \n\n+ ( -33550/484 - 28*(195*65)/(143*56) ) t \n\n+ (3025/484 + 14*(65\u00b2)/56\u00b2 - 78750/3136 ) ] = 0\n\nThis is extremely tedious, but let me compute each coefficient step by step. \n\nFirst, compute the coefficient of t\u00b2:\n\nTerm1: 93025 /484 \n\nTerm2: 14*(195\u00b2)/143\u00b2 \n\nCompute Term1:\n\n93025 /484. Let me see, 484 is 22\u00b2, 93025 divided by 484. Let me see 484*192 = 484*(200 -8) = 96800 - 3872 = 92928. So 93025 - 92928 = 97. So 93025/484 = 192 + 97/484 \u2248 192.2. \n\nBut exact fraction: 93025/484. Let me see if 484 divides into 93025. 484*192 = 92928, remainder 97. So 93025/484 = 192 + 97/484. \n\nTerm2: 14*(195\u00b2)/143\u00b2 \n\n195\u00b2 = 38025, 143\u00b2 = 20449. \n\nSo Term2 = 14*38025 /20449 = 532350 /20449 \n\nTherefore, total t\u00b2 coefficient:\n\n93025/484 + 532350/20449 \n\nTo add these, need common denominator. Let me see 484 and 20449. \n\nNote that 143 is 11*13, so 143\u00b2 = (11*13)^2 = 121*169 = 20449. \n\n484 is 22\u00b2 = (2*11)^2 = 4*121. \n\nTherefore, 484 = 4*121, and 20449 = 121*169. \n\nTherefore, LCM of 484 and 20449 is 4*121*169 = 4*20449. \n\nWait, 484 = 4*121, 20449 = 121*169. So LCM is 4*121*169. \n\nTherefore, convert each term:\n\nFirst term: (93025/484) = (93025 * 169)/(4*121*169) \n\nSecond term: (532350/20449) = (532350 *4)/(4*121*169)\n\nCompute numerators:\n\nFirst term numerator: 93025 *169. Let me compute 93025 * 100 = 9,302,500; 93025 * 60 = 5,581,500; 93025 *9 = 837,225. So total 9,302,500 +5,581,500 = 14,884,000 +837,225 = 15,721,225. \n\nSecond term numerator: 532,350 *4 = 2,129,400 \n\nTherefore total numerator for t\u00b2 coefficient:\n\n15,721,225 + 2,129,400 = 17,850,625 \n\nDenominator: 4*121*169 = 4*20449 = 81,796 \n\nTherefore, t\u00b2 coefficient is 17,850,625 /81,796 \n\nHmm, that's a big fraction. Let me see if it can be simplified. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(17,850,625, 81,796). Let me see:\n\nFirst, factor denominator 81,796. Let's divide by 4: 81,796 /4 = 20,449, which is 143\u00b2. \n\nSo denominator is 4*143\u00b2. \n\nNumerator: 17,850,625. Let me see if divisible by 143. \n\n143*125,000 = 17,875,000 which is larger than numerator. \n\n143*124,800 = 143*(125,000 - 200) = 17,875,000 - 28,600 = 17,846,400 \n\nSubtract from numerator: 17,850,625 -17,846,400 = 4,225 \n\n4,225 divided by 143: 143*29 = 4,147, remainder 78. Not divisible. \n\nHmm, maybe not. Let me check if numerator is divisible by 25: yes, ends with 25. \n\n17,850,625 \u00f725 = 714,025 \n\nDenominator 81,796 \u00f74 =20,449. \n\nSo 714,025 /20,449. Let me see if 20,449 divides into 714,025. \n\n20,449 *35 = 20,449*30 +20,449*5 = 613,470 +102,245 = 715,715 which is more than 714,025. \n\nSo 34*20,449 = 20,449*30 +20,449*4 = 613,470 +81,796 = 695,266 \n\n714,025 -695,266 = 18,759 \n\nNot divisible. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, since we know that the product of the roots is C/A, and one root is 0, so the other root is -B/A. Wait, Vieta's formula says that for equation At\u00b2 + Bt + C =0, the product is C/A and sum is -B/A. Since one root is 0, then the other root is -B/A. \n\nWait, actually, if the roots are t1 and t2, then t1 + t2 = -B/A and t1*t2 = C/A. If one root is 0, then t2 = -B/A and C/A =0. \n\nTherefore, the non-zero root is t_p = -B/A. \n\nTherefore, if I can compute coefficients A and B, then t_p = -B/A. \n\nLet me try to compute coefficients A and B. \n\nFirst, coefficient A (coefficient of t\u00b2):\n\nA = 93025/484 + 14*(195/143)^2 \n\nLet me compute 14*(195/143)^2:\n\n14*(195\u00b2)/(143\u00b2) = 14*(38025)/20449 = 532,350 /20,449 \n\nSo A = 93,025/484 + 532,350/20,449 \n\nConvert 93,025/484 to denominator 20,449:\n\nSince 484 = 4*121, and 20,449 = 143\u00b2 = (11*13)^2 = 121*169. \n\nTherefore, 484 = 4*121, so 20,449 = 121*169. \n\nTherefore, 93,025/484 = (93,025 /4) * (1/121) \n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 93,025/484 = (93,025 \u00f7 121) / (484 \u00f7121) = (769)/4 \n\nWait, 121*769 = 121*(700 +69) = 84,700 + 8,349 = 93,049. Hmm, close but not exact. \n\nWait, 121*769 = 121*(700 + 60 +9) = 121*700=84,700; 121*60=7,260; 121*9=1,089. Total: 84,700 +7,260 = 91,960 +1,089 = 93,049. \n\nBut numerator is 93,025, so 93,025 = 93,049 -24. \n\nHmm, so 93,025/484 = (93,049 -24)/484 = (121*769 -24)/ (4*121) \n\nThis might not help. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute numerically:\n\n93,025 /484 \u2248 93,025 \u00f7 484 \u2248 192.2 (since 484*192 = 92,928, so 93,025 -92,928 =97, so 192 + 97/484 \u2248192.2)\n\nSimilarly, 532,350 /20,449 \u2248532,350 \u00f720,449 \u224826.04 (since 20,449*26 = 531,674, so 532,350 -531,674 =676, so 26 + 676/20,449 \u224826.033)\n\nTherefore, A \u2248192.2 +26.033\u2248218.233\n\nNow coefficient B (coefficient of t):\n\nB = -33,550/484 -28*(195*65)/(143*56)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -33,550 /484 \u2248-33,550 \u00f7484 \u2248-69.318 (since 484*69 = 33,476, so 33,550 -33,476=74, so -69 -74/484\u2248-69.153)\n\nSecond term: -28*(195*65)/(143*56)\n\nCompute numerator: 28*195*65 \n\n28*195 = 5,460; 5,460*65 = 354,900 \n\nDenominator:143*56 = 8,008 \n\nTherefore, the second term is -354,900 /8,008 \u2248-44.32 (since 8,008*44 = 352,352; 354,900 -352,352=2,548; 2,548/8,008\u22480.318, so total\u2248-44.318)\n\nTherefore total B \u2248-69.153 -44.318\u2248-113.471\n\nTherefore, t_p = -B/A \u2248 -(-113.471)/218.233\u2248113.471/218.233\u22480.52. \n\nHmm, so approximately t_p \u22480.52. \n\nWait, but this is an approximate value. However, since we need an exact value, perhaps there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, recall that Power of a Point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. \n\nWe can compute DA and then DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = AD + DP? Wait, need to clarify the direction. \n\nWait, point D is outside the circle, line AD passes through A (on the circle) and goes to D, then extends to P on the circle again. So the points are ordered A, D, P along the line. Therefore, AP = AD + DP. \n\nBut according to Power of a Point, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nLet me denote DA as the length from D to A, and DP as the length from D to P. Since P is on the opposite side of D from A, then DP = DA + AP? Wait, no. Wait, if A is on the circle, D is outside, then the line AD goes from A through D to P. Wait, actually, the order is A---P---D? Or A---D---P? \n\nWait, need to clarify the order. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, which are outside the circle, so D is outside the circle. The line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), and then P is the second intersection with the circle. Therefore, the points are ordered A, then D, then P. Wait, but if you go from A through D, then P would be beyond D from A. But since D is outside, then P must be on the other side of D from A? Wait, no, actually, if you start at A, go through D (outside), then the other intersection P must be on the extension beyond D. \n\nWait, but in that case, AP would be AD + DP. \n\nBut according to Power of a Point, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nPower of a Point D with respect to circle \u03c9 is equal to the square of the tangent from D to \u03c9, which is DB\u00b2 (since DB is tangent). \n\nAlso, Power of D is equal to DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P along the line. \n\nBut since A is on the circle, DA is just the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. Since P is on the opposite side of D from A, then DP = DA + AP? Wait, no. Wait, if the points are A---D---P, then AP = AD + DP. But in terms of directed lengths, if we consider DA as positive in the direction from D to A, then DP would be negative, but in Power of a Point, it's the product of the lengths, so absolute values. \n\nAlternatively, using signed lengths, if we take DA as negative (since direction from D to A is opposite to the direction towards P), then DA * DP = - |DA| * |DP| = - (DA * DP). But Power of a Point is DA * DP = DB\u00b2, so actually, the formula is |DA| * |DP| = DB\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, if we let DA be the length from D to A, and DP be the length from D to P, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, AP = AD + DP? Wait, if the points are A---D---P, then AP = AD + DP. But AD is the distance from A to D, and DP is from D to P, so yes, AP = AD + DP. \n\nTherefore, AP = AD + DP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA). \n\nTherefore, AP = AD + (DB\u00b2 / DA) = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/DA \n\nTherefore, if I can compute AD and DB, then I can compute AP. \n\nThis seems promising. Let me try this approach. \n\nFirst, compute DB. Since DB is the length of the tangent from D to the circle at point B. \n\nBut since D lies on the tangent at B, DB is indeed the tangent length, so DB is just the length from D to B. \n\nWait, yes, because the tangent at B has length DB. \n\nTherefore, DB is the distance between D and B. \n\nSimilarly, DC is the distance between D and C, which should be equal to DB. \n\nWait, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so DB = DC. \n\nTherefore, we can compute DB as the distance between D and B. \n\nWe have coordinates for D and B, so let's compute DB. \n\nCoordinates of D: (305/22, 195\u221a14/143)\n\nCoordinates of B: (5,0)\n\nCompute the distance between them:\n\n\u0394x = 305/22 -5 = 305/22 - 110/22 = 195/22\n\n\u0394y = 195\u221a14/143 -0 = 195\u221a14/143\n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2 = (195/22)^2 + (195\u221a14/143)^2 \n\nFactor out (195)^2:\n\nDB\u00b2 = (195)^2 [ (1/22)^2 + ( (\u221a14)/143 )^2 ]\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n(1/22)^2 + (14)/(143)^2 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1/(22)^2 = 1/484\n\n14/(143)^2 =14/(20449)\n\nTherefore, total inside the brackets:\n\n1/484 +14/20449 \n\nFind common denominator, which is 484*20449. \n\nBut let me compute numerically:\n\n1/484 \u22480.002066\n\n14/20449\u22480.0006846\n\nTotal\u22480.002066 +0.0006846\u22480.0027506\n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2 \u2248 (195)^2 *0.0027506 \n\n195\u00b2 = 38,025 \n\n38,025 *0.0027506 \u224838,025 *0.00275 \u224838,025 *0.002 +38,025*0.00075 \n\n=76.05 +28.51875\u2248104.56875 \n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2\u2248104.56875 \n\nBut let me compute exactly:\n\nCompute 1/484 +14/20449:\n\nConvert to common denominator 484*20449:\n\n= (20449 +14*484)/(484*20449)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n20449 +14*484 =20449 +6,776 =27,225 \n\nTherefore, the bracket term",
