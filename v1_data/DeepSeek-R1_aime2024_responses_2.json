        "question": "Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,9,10\\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers.

        "response": "Okay, so Jen is playing this lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are selected. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she has already won a prize. They want the answer as a reduced fraction m/n and then m + n. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We need to find the conditional probability P(Grand Prize | Prize). By the definition of conditional probability, this is equal to P(Grand Prize and Prize) divided by P(Prize). But since winning the grand prize automatically means she won a prize (because all four numbers match, which certainly includes at least two matches), this simplifies to P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize). So, I need to compute both the probability of winning the grand prize and the probability of winning any prize (at least two matches), then take their ratio.\n\nLet me start by computing the total number of possible ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers from 10. That's just the combination C(10,4). Let me calculate that: C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible combinations.\n\nThe probability of winning the grand prize is straightforward. There's only one combination that matches all four of Jen's numbers. So, P(Grand Prize) = 1 / 210.\n\nNow, the probability of winning a prize is the probability that at least two numbers match. To compute this, it's easier to calculate the complementary probability (i.e., the probability of having fewer than two matches) and subtract it from 1. So, P(Prize) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match).\n\nLet me compute P(0 matches). This is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that none of them are in Jen's chosen 4 numbers. Since Jen picked 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers left. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with 0 matches is C(6,4). Let me compute that: C(6,4) = 15. Therefore, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.\n\nNext, P(1 match). This is the number of ways to choose 1 of Jen's numbers and 3 from the remaining 6 numbers. So, that's C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let me compute C(4,1) = 4 and C(6,3) = 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(1 match) = 80 / 210 = 8/21.\n\nTherefore, P(Prize) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 5: 23/42. So, P(Prize) = 23/42.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability P(Grand Prize | Prize) = (1/210) / (23/42). Dividing these fractions: (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). Simplify 42/210 first: 42 divides into 210 five times (since 210 \u00f7 42 = 5). So, this simplifies to 1/(5*23) = 1/115. Wait, that seems low. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, hold on. When I divide (1/210) by (23/42), that's equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal. So, (1/210) * (42/23) = (1 * 42) / (210 * 23) = 42 / 4830. Then, simplifying 42/4830: divide numerator and denominator by 42: 1/115. Yes, same result. So, 1/115. Therefore, m = 1, n = 115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, since 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors. So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.\n\nWait, but let me verify again because sometimes these probability problems can be tricky. Let me confirm the number of ways to get 0, 1, and 2+ matches.\n\nTotal combinations: C(10,4) = 210. Correct.\n\nNumber of 0 matches: C(6,4) = 15. Correct, since we choose all 4 numbers from the 6 she didn't pick.\n\nNumber of 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20 = 80. Correct.\n\nSo, number of 0 or 1 matches: 15 + 80 = 95. Therefore, number of 2, 3, or 4 matches: 210 - 95 = 115. Therefore, P(Prize) = 115/210 = 23/42. Correct.\n\nThen, P(Grand Prize) is 1/210, so conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115. Yes, that's correct. So, the answer is 1 + 115 = 116.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check another way. Alternatively, given that she has already won a prize (i.e., at least two matches), the conditional probability of it being the grand prize is equal to the number of favorable outcomes (which is 1, the case where all four match) divided by the number of possible prize-winning outcomes (which is the number of ways to have at least two matches). So, instead of using probabilities, maybe compute it combinatorially.\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes (Grand Prize): 1.\n\nNumber of possible prize-winning outcomes: total number of ways to have at least two matches. Which is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0). Let me compute that:\n\nC(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15 = 90.\n\nC(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6 = 24.\n\nC(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1*1 = 1.\n\nTotal: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, total prize-winning combinations: 115. Therefore, conditional probability is 1/115. So, same result. Therefore, answer is 116.\n\nTherefore, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{116}"
