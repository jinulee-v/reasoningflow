        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2. The problem gives me the components of the operator P in the x, y, and z directions as 2x2 matrices multiplied by \u0127/2. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts here.\n\nFirst, in quantum mechanics, operators corresponding to observables are represented by matrices, and their eigenvectors correspond to the states of the system with definite values of that observable. Since we're dealing with a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, the operators P_x, P_y, P_z should be analogous to the Pauli spin matrices, scaled by \u0127/2. Let me check the given matrices to confirm.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- P_x is (\u0127/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's exactly the Pauli-X matrix multiplied by \u0127/2. Similarly,\n\n- P_y is (\u0127/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli-Y matrix scaled by \u0127/2,\n\n- P_z is (\u0127/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], which is the Pauli-Z matrix scaled by \u0127/2.\n\nSo, the operator P here is analogous to the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle, but instead of S, it's called P. The question is about finding the eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSince the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, right? So the direction vector n can be represented as (sin\u03b8, 0, cos\u03b8), since it's in the x-z plane (so y-component is zero). Therefore, the operator P_n along direction n would be a linear combination of P_x and P_z, since the y-component is zero.\n\nThe general form for the operator along an arbitrary direction n is P_n = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0, so P_n = P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.\n\nGiven that n is a unit vector, n_x = sin\u03b8 and n_z = cos\u03b8 (assuming \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis). Therefore, substituting the components:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] * sin\u03b8 + (\u0127/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]] * cos\u03b8\n\nLet me compute this matrix:\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\nTerm from P_x: (\u0127/2) * sin\u03b8 * [[0,1],[1,0]]\n\nTerm from P_z: (\u0127/2) * cos\u03b8 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]\n\nAdding them together:\n\nP_n = (\u0127/2)[[0*sin\u03b8 + 1*cos\u03b8, 1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8], [1*sin\u03b8 + 0*cos\u03b8, 0*sin\u03b8 + (-1)*cos\u03b8]]\n\nWait, let me do that step by step.\n\nThe (1,1) element is (0 * sin\u03b8) + (1 * cos\u03b8) = cos\u03b8\n\nThe (1,2) element is (1 * sin\u03b8) + (0 * cos\u03b8) = sin\u03b8\n\nThe (2,1) element is (1 * sin\u03b8) + (0 * cos\u03b8) = sin\u03b8\n\nThe (2,2) element is (0 * sin\u03b8) + (-1 * cos\u03b8) = -cos\u03b8\n\nTherefore, the matrix for P_n is (\u0127/2) multiplied by:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8],\n [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nSo, P_n = (\u0127/2) * [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nWe need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +\u0127/2. Let me denote the eigenvalue as \u03bb = +\u0127/2.\n\nSo, the equation is P_n * v = \u03bb v, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nLet me write this equation out. Let v = [v1; v2]. Then,\n\n(\u0127/2)[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] * [v1; v2] = (\u0127/2)[v1; v2]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2/\u0127 to simplify:\n\n[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]] * [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 = v1\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 = v2\n\nLet me rearrange both equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\ncos\u03b8 * v1 + sin\u03b8 * v2 - v1 = 0\n\n=> (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\nSecond equation:\n\nsin\u03b8 * v1 - cos\u03b8 * v2 - v2 = 0\n\n=> sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0\n\nSo, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) (cos\u03b8 - 1) v1 + sin\u03b8 v2 = 0\n\n2) sin\u03b8 v1 - (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2 = 0\n\nThese two equations must be satisfied simultaneously. Let me see if they are consistent.\n\nLet me try to express v2 from the first equation:\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nsin\u03b8 v2 = (1 - cos\u03b8) v1\n\n=> v2 = [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v1\n\nSimilarly, from equation 2:\n\nsin\u03b8 v1 = (cos\u03b8 + 1) v2\n\n=> v2 = [sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 + 1)] v1\n\nTherefore, both expressions for v2 must be equal:\n\n[(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v1 = [sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 + 1)] v1\n\nAssuming v1 \u2260 0 (since otherwise the eigenvector would be trivial), we can divide both sides by v1:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 + 1)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(1 - cos\u03b8)(cos\u03b8 + 1) = sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nLeft side: (1 - cos\u03b8)(1 + cos\u03b8) = 1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nWhich matches the right side. So the equations are consistent, as expected.\n\nTherefore, we can proceed with either expression for v2 in terms of v1. Let me pick the first one:\n\nv2 = [(1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] v1\n\nAlternatively, using the second expression:\n\nv2 = [sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 + 1)] v1\n\nEither way, let's choose one and proceed. Let me use the second expression because maybe it's easier to handle.\n\nLet me write v2 = [sin\u03b8 / (cos\u03b8 + 1)] v1\n\nLet me set v1 = 1 (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple), then v2 = sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 + 1). But we need to normalize the eigenvector. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to parametrize this.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider using trigonometric identities to simplify the expressions.\n\nNote that 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)\n\nand sin\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, (1 - cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8 = [2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] / [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSimilarly, sin\u03b8/(cos\u03b8 + 1) = [2 sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2)] / [2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)] = tan(\u03b8/2)\n\nSo both expressions give v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) v1\n\nTherefore, the eigenvector can be written as:\n\nv = [v1; tan(\u03b8/2) v1] = v1 [1; tan(\u03b8/2)]\n\nTo make this a normalized eigenvector, we need the norm to be 1:\n\n|v1|\u00b2 + |tan(\u03b8/2) v1|\u00b2 = |v1|\u00b2 (1 + tan\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) = |v1|\u00b2 sec\u00b2(\u03b8/2) = 1\n\nTherefore, |v1| = cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nAssuming v1 is real (since we can choose the phase), then v1 = cos(\u03b8/2), and v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)]\n\nWait, that's option A. But let me check again.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify this step-by-step.\n\nSuppose v1 = cos(\u03b8/2), then v2 = tan(\u03b8/2) * cos(\u03b8/2) = [sin(\u03b8/2)/cos(\u03b8/2)] * cos(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2). So yes, that gives [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)], which is option A. But let me check if this is indeed an eigenvector.\n\nLet me plug into the original equation.\n\nLet me compute P_n * v where v is [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)]\n\nFirst, P_n is (\u0127/2)*[[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]\n\nMultiply by v:\n\nFirst component:\n\n(\u0127/2)[cos\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 * sin(\u03b8/2)]\n\nSecond component:\n\n(\u0127/2)[sin\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) - cos\u03b8 * sin(\u03b8/2)]\n\nLet me compute the first component:\n\ncos\u03b8 * cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 * sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8 - \u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2) by the cosine addition formula. Wait, cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So here, if A = \u03b8 and B = \u03b8/2, then cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) + sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8 - \u03b8/2) = cos(\u03b8/2). So first component is (\u0127/2) cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSecond component:\n\nsin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8/2) - cos\u03b8 sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8 - \u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2). Because sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB. So that's sin(\u03b8/2). Therefore, second component is (\u0127/2) sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nTherefore, the result of P_n * v is (\u0127/2)[cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)] which is exactly (\u0127/2) v. So that checks out. Therefore, the eigenvector is indeed [cos(\u03b8/2); sin(\u03b8/2)], which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the other option B. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). But in the problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03c6 (azimuthal angle) would be either 0 or \u03c0, since it's in the x-z plane. But since the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, \u03c6 is fixed for that direction. However, in the problem statement, they just say \"arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane\", so maybe \u03c6 is fixed for that direction. However, in the given options, option B has a phase factor e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. But in our solution, there is no phase factor. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we assumed that the eigenvector components are real. Is that necessarily the case?\n\nWait, actually, in quantum mechanics, eigenvectors can have complex phases, but since the operator P_n is Hermitian (as all observables must be), its eigenvectors can be chosen to be real if the operator has real entries? Wait, let me check the matrix P_n.\n\nLooking at the matrix for P_n: [[cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8], [sin\u03b8, -cos\u03b8]]. The off-diagonal elements are real, and the diagonal elements are real. Therefore, the matrix is Hermitian (since it's equal to its conjugate transpose). Therefore, its eigenvectors can be chosen to be real. Therefore, the eigenvector we found with real components is valid, so option A is correct.\n\nBut let me check the other options. Option B has a phase e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle \u03c6 is the angle around the z-axis, but since we are in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, so e^{i\u03c6} would be 1 or -1. However, since the eigenvector is defined up to a global phase, the phase could be absorbed. Therefore, perhaps the answer is presented in a different form. Wait, but in the problem statement, they mention \"the normalized eigenvector\", so maybe they expect a normalized vector with possible complex phases?\n\nWait, but in our calculation, we found a real eigenvector. Let me see if there's another way this could be presented with a phase. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming v1 is real?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different parametrization. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction n is given in terms of spherical coordinates where \u03b8 is the polar angle from the z-axis, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is either 0 or \u03c0, so the direction is along the x-z plane. But in that case, the eigenvector might have a phase depending on \u03c6? Wait, but in our case, since the direction is in x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so the operator P_n doesn't have any imaginary components except those from the Pauli matrices. Wait, but in our calculation, the matrix P_n ended up being real because the y-component was zero. Wait, actually, let me check again.\n\nWait, the operator P_n is a combination of P_x and P_z. Since P_x is real and symmetric, and P_z is diagonal real. So their combination is also real and symmetric. Therefore, the eigenvectors can be chosen real. Therefore, the phase is not necessary here. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me check the other options again. Option B is (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). If \u03b8 here is the polar angle, then perhaps there's confusion between \u03b8 in the problem and \u03b8 in the answer. Wait, in the problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis, so the polar angle. So in spherical coordinates, \u03b8 is the angle from the z-axis, and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle. Since it's in the x-z plane, \u03c6 is 0 or \u03c0. So if the answer is written in terms of \u03b8 as the polar angle, then the eigenvector components would be cos(\u03b8/2) and sin(\u03b8/2), which is option A. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different convention where \u03b8 is the angle from the x-axis? But the problem says \"arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane\", so probably \u03b8 is measured from the z-axis. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me consider a specific case where \u03b8 is 0, so the direction is along the z-axis. Then the eigenvector should be [1;0], since P_z has eigenvalues +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 with eigenvectors [1;0] and [0;1]. Plugging \u03b8=0 into option A: cos(0/2)=cos0=1, sin(0/2)=0, so [1;0], which is correct. Similarly, if \u03b8=\u03c0, direction is along -z, then the eigenvector should be [0;1]. Plugging \u03b8=\u03c0 into option A: cos(\u03c0/2)=0, sin(\u03c0/2)=1, so [0;1], which is correct. If \u03b8=\u03c0/2, direction along x-axis. Then the eigenvector should be [1;1]/\u221a2. Let's see: cos(\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2, sin(\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2, so [\u221a2/2; \u221a2/2], which is [1;1]/\u221a2, correct. So that works. So option A is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. But let me check the other options again to be sure.\n\nOption B: (cos\u03b8, e^{i\u03c6} sin\u03b8). If \u03b8 is the polar angle, then for \u03b8=0, this would give (1,0), which is correct. For \u03b8=\u03c0/2, direction along x-axis, then cos(\u03c0/2)=0, sin(\u03c0/2)=1, so (0, e^{i\u03c6}), but \u03c6 here would be 0 since it's along x-axis, so (0,1). But the correct eigenvector along x is [1;1]/\u221a2, so that's not matching. So option B is incorrect for \u03b8=\u03c0/2. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C: (\u221a(2/3)\u0127 cos(\u03b8/2), \u221a(1/3)\u0127 sin(\u03b8/2)). The presence of \u0127 here is odd because eigenvectors are dimensionless (since they are kets in Hilbert space, which are normalized). The problem says \"elements of the normalized eigenvector\", so they shouldn't have \u0127. So C and D have \u0127, which is probably incorrect. The question mentions \"elements of the normalized eigenvector\", so the answer should not include \u0127. So options C and D can be eliminated because of the \u0127.\n\nOption D: (\u221a(2/3)\u0127, \u221a(1/3)\u0127). Again, has \u0127 and is not dependent on \u03b8, so that's not right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. The problem says \"along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane\". So the direction is in x-z, so the eigenvector should depend on the angle \u03b8 from z-axis, which is exactly what option A does. So yes, A is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n</think>\n\nTo find the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator \\(\\vec{P}\\) for a muon along an arbitrary direction \\(\\vec{n}\\) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(+\\hbar/2\\), we start by noting that the components of \\(\\vec{P}\\) are given by the Pauli matrices scaled by \\(\\hbar/2\\).
