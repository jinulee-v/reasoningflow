        "question": "Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n\u2074 + 1 is divisible by p\u00b2. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m\u2074 + 1 is divisible by p\u00b2. Hmm, this seems like a problem involving number theory, primes, and maybe some modular arithmetic. Let me start breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is asking for the smallest prime p where p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 + 1 for some n. Then, once we have that p, find the smallest m such that p\u00b2 divides m\u2074 + 1. So, essentially, I need to find the smallest prime p for which the congruence n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2 has a solution, and then find the minimal such n (which is m).\n\nLet me recall that if n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2, then n\u2078 \u2261 1 mod p\u00b2. That means the order of n modulo p\u00b2 divides 8. But also, since n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2, the order can't be a divisor of 4, because n\u2074 \u2261 -1 \u2260 1 mod p\u00b2. Therefore, the order of n modulo p\u00b2 must be exactly 8. So, 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group modulo p\u00b2. The multiplicative group modulo p\u00b2 has order p(p - 1). Therefore, 8 divides p(p - 1). Since p is prime, either p is 2, or p is an odd prime.\n\nWait, let's check p=2 first. Let me see if 2\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1. Let's compute n\u2074 +1 mod 4. Since n is an integer, n mod 2 is either 0 or 1. If n is even, n\u2074 is 0 mod 4, so n\u2074 +1 is 1 mod 4. If n is odd, n\u2074 is 1 mod 4, so n\u2074 +1 is 2 mod 4. Therefore, the maximum power of 2 dividing n\u2074 +1 is 2. So 2\u00b2=4 divides n\u2074 +1 only if n\u2074 +1 \u2261 0 mod 4. But as we saw, n\u2074 +1 mod 4 is either 1 or 2, so never 0 mod 4. Therefore, p=2 is impossible. So p must be an odd prime.\n\nTherefore, p is an odd prime. Then, the multiplicative group modulo p\u00b2 has order p(p - 1). So 8 divides p(p - 1). Since p is odd, p is congruent to 1 mod 2, so p-1 is even. Therefore, p-1 is divisible by 2, but to get 8, we need more. Let me see: since 8 divides p(p - 1), and p is odd, so p is coprime to 2, so 8 must divide (p - 1). Therefore, p \u2261 1 mod 8. Wait, is that necessarily true?\n\nWait, let me think again. The multiplicative group modulo p\u00b2 has order p(p - 1). So for the multiplicative group to have an element of order 8, the order of the group must be divisible by 8. Since p is odd, p and p-1 are coprime. So either p \u2261 1 mod 8 or p-1 \u2261 0 mod 8. Wait, actually, the order is p(p - 1). So 8 divides p(p - 1). Since p is odd, p is 1 mod 2, so p-1 is even. Let me factor the power of 2 in p(p - 1). Since p is odd, the power of 2 comes from p -1. Therefore, to have 8 divide p(p -1), we need that p -1 is divisible by 8. Therefore, p \u22611 mod 8. So primes congruent to 1 mod 8. So the primes we need to consider are primes p \u22611 mod 8. The smallest such primes are 17, 41, 73, etc. Wait, 17 is the first prime after 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. 17 is 1 mod 8 (since 17-1=16, which is divisible by 8). So 17 is the first candidate.\n\nBut before jumping to conclusions, let me check if that's sufficient. So if p \u22611 mod 8, then does the equation n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2 have a solution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps even if p \u22611 mod 8, maybe the solution only exists modulo p but not modulo p\u00b2? Hmm, so maybe we need to use Hensel's lemma or something?\n\nWait, but first, let me recall that if p \u22611 mod 8, then -1 is a fourth power modulo p. Because the multiplicative group mod p has order p-1, which is divisible by 8, so there are elements of order 8, so -1 is a square (since (-1)^2 =1, but in a group of order divisible by 8, -1 would have order 2, so there exists elements of order 4, 8, etc. Wait, actually, maybe I need to think in terms of the field.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has solutions when p \u22611 mod 8. Let me check for p=17. Let me see if there exists an n such that n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod 17.\n\nLet me compute n\u2074 mod 17. Let me try n from 1 to 16:\n\n1\u2074 = 1 mod17\n\n2\u2074 = 16 mod17\n\n3\u2074 = 81 mod17. 81 divided by 17 is 4*17=68, 81-68=13, so 13 mod17.\n\n4\u2074 = (2\u2074)^2 = 16\u00b2 = 256 mod17. 256 - 15*17=256-255=1 mod17.\n\n5\u2074: 5\u00b2=25\u22618 mod17, so 5\u2074=8\u00b2=64\u226113 mod17.\n\n6\u2074: 6\u00b2=36\u22612 mod17, so 6\u2074=2\u00b2=4 mod17.\n\n7\u2074: 7\u00b2=49\u226115 mod17, so 7\u2074=15\u00b2=225\u2261225-13*17=225-221=4 mod17.\n\n8\u2074: 8\u00b2=64\u226113 mod17, so 8\u2074=13\u00b2=169\u226116 mod17.\n\n9\u2074: 9\u00b2=81\u226113 mod17, so same as 8\u2074, so 13\u00b2=169\u226116 mod17.\n\n10\u2074: 10\u00b2=100\u226115 mod17, so 10\u2074=15\u00b2=225\u22614 mod17.\n\n11\u2074: 11\u00b2=121\u2261121-7*17=121-119=2 mod17, so 11\u2074=2\u00b2=4 mod17.\n\n12\u2074: 12\u00b2=144\u2261144-8*17=144-136=8 mod17, so 12\u2074=8\u00b2=64\u226113 mod17.\n\n13\u2074: 13\u00b2=169\u226116 mod17, so 13\u2074=16\u00b2=256\u22611 mod17.\n\n14\u2074: 14\u00b2=196\u2261196-11*17=196-187=9 mod17, so 14\u2074=9\u00b2=81\u226113 mod17.\n\n15\u2074: 15\u00b2=225\u22614 mod17, so 15\u2074=4\u00b2=16 mod17.\n\n16\u2074: 16\u00b2=256\u22611 mod17, so 16\u2074=1\u00b2=1 mod17.\n\nHmm, so looking at all n from 1 to 16 mod17, the fourth powers mod17 are 1, 16, 13, 4, and 1 again. Wait, so the possible fourth powers mod17 are 1, 4, 13, 16. So -1 mod17 is 16. So 16 is a fourth power mod17. Indeed, 2\u2074=16 mod17. Wait, 2\u2074 is 16 mod17. So 2\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod17. Wait, so 2\u2074 is exactly -1 mod17. So that's interesting. So n=2 mod17 gives n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod17. Therefore, there is a solution mod17. But the question is about mod p\u00b2, which is 17\u00b2=289 here.\n\nSo, does there exist an n such that n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod 289?\n\nIf so, then p=17 would be the prime we are looking for, and then m would be the minimal n such that n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod 289. Alternatively, maybe 17 is not the prime, and we have to check higher primes?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use Hensel's lemma to lift the solution from mod17 to mod17\u00b2. Let me recall Hensel's lemma: if f(n) \u22610 mod p and f'(n) not \u22610 mod p, then there is a unique lift mod p\u00b2. But here, f(n)=n\u2074 +1. So f'(n)=4n\u00b3. So if we have a solution n\u2080 mod17 with n\u2080\u2074 \u2261-1 mod17, then to lift to mod17\u00b2, we need that f'(n\u2080) \u22614n\u2080\u00b3 mod17 is not 0. Since n\u2080 is 2 mod17, so n\u2080\u00b3 mod17 is 8 mod17. So 4*8=32\u226115 mod17\u22600. Therefore, Hensel's lemma says we can lift the solution uniquely. Therefore, there is a solution mod17\u00b2. Therefore, p=17 is possible. So maybe 17 is the prime we need?\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n\u2074 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". So if 17 works, then it's the smallest such prime. Let me check if a smaller prime could work. Wait, primes less than 17 which are 1 mod 8: 17 is the first prime that is 1 mod8. The primes before that are 2,3,5,7,11,13. None of these are 1 mod8 except 17. So 17 is the first candidate. But let me check primes like 5,7, etc., even though they are not 1 mod8, maybe there's a solution?\n\nWait, for example, take p=5. Let's see if there exists n with n\u2074 \u2261-1 mod25. Let me check n from 0 to 24. Let's compute n\u2074 mod25.\n\nAlternatively, first check mod5. For n\u2074 \u2261-1 mod5. But by Fermat's little theorem, n\u2074 \u22611 mod5 for n not divisible by 5. So n\u2074 \u22611 mod5, so 1\u2261-1 mod5? That would require 2\u22610 mod5, which is false. Therefore, there is no solution mod5, so certainly none mod25. So p=5 is out.\n\nSimilarly, p=7. Let's check mod7. n\u2074 \u2261-1 mod7. Let's see, n\u2074 mod7. Since 7 is prime, n^6\u22611 mod7. So n^4 \u2261n^{-2} mod7. So n^4 \u2261-1 mod7 implies n^{-2}\u2261-1 mod7, so n\u00b2\u2261-1 mod7. Let me check if -1 is a quadratic residue mod7. The quadratic residues mod7 are 0,1,2,4. Since 3\u00b2=2, 2\u00b2=4, 6\u00b2=36\u22611 mod7. So -1 mod7 is 6, which is not a quadratic residue. Therefore, no solution mod7, so no solution mod49 either.\n\nSimilarly, p=13. Let's check mod13. Let me see if n\u2074 \u2261-1 mod13. Let's compute n\u2074 mod13. Let me try n from 1 to 12:\n\n1\u2074=1 mod13\n\n2\u2074=16\u22613 mod13\n\n3\u2074=81\u226181-6*13=81-78=3 mod13\n\nWait, 3\u2074= (3\u00b2)\u00b2=9\u00b2=81\u22613 mod13?\n\nWait, 9 mod13 is 9, 9\u00b2=81, 81 divided by 13 is 6*13=78, so 81-78=3. So yes, 3 mod13.\n\n4\u2074: 4\u00b2=16\u22613 mod13, so 4\u2074=3\u00b2=9 mod13.\n\n5\u2074: 5\u00b2=25\u226112 mod13, so 5\u2074=12\u00b2=144\u2261144-11*13=144-143=1 mod13.\n\n6\u2074: 6\u00b2=36\u226110 mod13, so 6\u2074=10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n7\u2074: 7\u00b2=49\u226110 mod13, so 7\u2074=10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n8\u2074: 8\u00b2=64\u226112 mod13, so 8\u2074=12\u00b2=144\u22611 mod13.\n\n9\u2074: 9\u00b2=81\u22613 mod13, so 9\u2074=3\u00b2=9 mod13.\n\n10\u2074: 10\u00b2=100\u22619 mod13, so 10\u2074=9\u00b2=81\u22613 mod13.\n\n11\u2074: 11\u00b2=121\u22614 mod13, so 11\u2074=4\u00b2=16\u22613 mod13.\n\n12\u2074: 12\u00b2=144\u22611 mod13, so 12\u2074=1\u00b2=1 mod13.\n\nHmm, so the fourth powers mod13 are 1,3,9. So -1 mod13 is 12, which is not among them. Therefore, no solution mod13, so no solution mod169 either.\n\nSimilarly, p=11. Let me check mod11. n\u2074 \u2261-1 mod11. Let's compute n\u2074 mod11.\n\nn from 1 to 10:\n\n1\u2074=1 mod11\n\n2\u2074=16\u22615 mod11\n\n3\u2074=81\u226181-7*11=81-77=4 mod11\n\n4\u2074=256\u2261256-23*11=256-253=3 mod11\n\n5\u2074=625\u2261625-56*11=625-616=9 mod11\n\n6\u2074=(6\u00b2)^2=36\u00b2\u22613\u00b2=9 mod11 (Wait, 6\u00b2=36\u22613 mod11, so 6\u2074=3\u00b2=9 mod11)\n\n7\u2074=(7\u00b2)^2=49\u00b2\u22615\u00b2=25\u22613 mod11 (since 7\u00b2=49\u22615 mod11)\n\n8\u2074=(8\u00b2)^2=64\u00b2\u22619\u00b2=81\u22614 mod11 (8\u00b2=64\u22619 mod11)\n\n9\u2074=(9\u00b2)^2=81\u00b2\u22614\u00b2=16\u22615 mod11 (9\u00b2=81\u22614 mod11)\n\n10\u2074=(10\u00b2)^2=100\u00b2\u22611\u00b2=1 mod11 (10\u00b2=100\u22611 mod11)\n\nSo the fourth powers mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. -1 mod11 is 10, which is not in the list. So no solution mod11, so no solution mod121.\n\nTherefore, primes less than 17 (which is the first prime \u22611 mod8) do not have solutions mod p\u00b2. So 17 is the first candidate. Since we saw that mod17, there is a solution (n=2 mod17), and Hensel's lemma allows lifting that to mod17\u00b2, so p=17 is the least prime. Therefore, the answer for p is 17, and now we need to find the minimal m such that m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to: find the minimal positive integer m such that m\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod 289 (since 17\u00b2=289). Let me try to compute that.\n\nFirst, since we know that n=2 mod17 is a solution mod17, so we can write m = 2 +17k, where k is an integer, and we need to find k such that (2 +17k)^4 \u2261 -1 mod289.\n\nLet me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod289. Since 17\u00b2=289, any term in the expansion with 17\u00b2 or higher power will be 0 mod289. So expanding (2 +17k)^4:\n\n= 2^4 + 4*(2)^3*(17k) + 6*(2)^2*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4\n\nBut mod289, terms with (17k)^2 or higher are 0 mod289, since (17)^2 divides those terms. Therefore, the expansion simplifies to:\n\n= 16 + 4*(8)*(17k) mod289\n\nBecause the first term is 16, the second term is 4*(8)*(17k), and the rest are multiples of 289. So:\n\n= 16 + 32*17k mod289\n\nCompute 32*17: 32*17 = 544. So 544k mod289. Since 544 divided by 289 is 1*289=289, 544-289=255. So 544 \u2261255 mod289. Therefore:\n\n=16 +255k mod289.\n\nWe want this \u2261 -1 mod289. So:\n\n16 +255k \u2261 -1 mod289\n\nSo 255k \u2261 -17 mod289\n\nSimplify: 255k \u2261 -17 mod289. Let me write this as 255k \u2261 272 mod289 (since -17 +289=272).\n\nNow, we can write this as 255k \u2261272 mod289. Let me solve for k.\n\nFirst, let's compute GCD(255,289). 255= 3*5*17, 289=17\u00b2. So GCD is 17. Therefore, the equation has solutions only if 17 divides 272. 272 divided by17 is 16, so yes, 17 divides 272. Therefore, solutions exist.\n\nDivide both sides by17: 15k \u226116 mod17 (since 255/17=15, 272/17=16, 289/17=17). So equation becomes 15k \u226116 mod17.\n\nNow, solve 15k \u226116 mod17. Let me find the inverse of 15 mod17. 15 and17 are coprime. 15\u2261-2 mod17, so inverse of -2 mod17. The inverse of 2 mod17 is 9, since 2*9=18\u22611 mod17. Therefore inverse of -2 is -9\u22618 mod17. Therefore, multiplying both sides by 8:\n\nk\u226116*8 mod17.\n\n16*8=128. 128 mod17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9. So k\u22619 mod17.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for k are k=9 +17t, where t is an integer. Since we want the minimal positive m, which is 2 +17k, we need the minimal k\u22650 such that k\u22619 mod17. The minimal k is 9. Therefore, m=2 +17*9=2 +153=155. Wait, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify this calculation again step by step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here.\n\nWe had:\n\nOriginal equation after expanding (2 +17k)^4 mod289:\n\n16 + 255k \u2261 -1 mod289 \u21d2 255k \u2261 -17 mod289 \u21d2 255k \u2261272 mod289.\n\nThen GCD(255,289)=17, so divide equation by17:\n\n255/17=15, 272/17=16, 289/17=17 \u21d2 15k \u226116 mod17.\n\nThen, solving 15k \u226116 mod17. Since 15 \u2261-2 mod17, so equation is -2k \u226116 mod17 \u21d2 2k \u2261-16 mod17 \u21d2 2k\u22611 mod17 (since -16 mod17 is 1). Wait, hold on, that might be a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nIf 15k \u226116 mod17,\n\nWe can write 15k \u226116 mod17,\n\nWe can write 15 \u2261 -2 mod17,\n\nSo -2k \u226116 mod17,\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: 2k \u2261 -16 mod17,\n\nBut -16 mod17 is 1, so 2k \u22611 mod17.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. Wait, -16 mod17 is 1? Let me check: 17-16=1, yes. So 2k\u22611 mod17. Therefore, solving 2k\u22611 mod17. The inverse of 2 mod17 is 9, as before. So k\u22619 mod17. Therefore, k=9 +17t. So that part was correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal k is 9, so m=2 +17*9=2+153=155. Let me check if m=155 indeed satisfies m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289.\n\nCompute 155 mod17: 155 divided by17 is 9*17=153, so 155\u22612 mod17, which is consistent with our initial solution mod17. Now, let's compute 155\u2074 mod289.\n\nBut computing 155\u2074 mod289 directly might be tedious. Let me see if there's a smarter way. Since m=2 +17*9, so m=2 +153=155. Let me compute m\u2074 +1 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, since we used Hensel's lemma, and the linear term gave us k=9, so the solution should be correct. But let me verify with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod289. Let me set k=9:\n\nFirst compute 2 +17*9 = 155. Let me compute 155^4 mod289.\n\nFirst compute 155 mod289 is 155.\n\nCompute 155\u00b2 first:\n\n155\u00b2 = (150 +5)^2 = 150\u00b2 + 2*150*5 +5\u00b2 = 22500 + 1500 +25 = 24025.\n\nBut mod289, let's divide 24025 by289.\n\nFirst compute how many times 289 goes into 24025.\n\n289*80=23120,\n\n24025 -23120=905,\n\n289*3=867,\n\n905-867=38,\n\nSo 24025 mod289 is 38. So 155\u00b2 \u226138 mod289.\n\nThen, 155^4 = (155\u00b2)^2 \u226138\u00b2 mod289.\n\n38\u00b2=1444.\n\nDivide 1444 by289:\n\n289*4=1156,\n\n1444-1156=288,\n\nSo 38\u00b2 \u2261288 mod289.\n\nBut 288 \u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 155\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289. Perfect! So that works. Therefore, m=155 is a solution.\n\nBut is it the minimal positive integer? Let me check if there is a smaller m. Since we started with the minimal k=9, giving m=155. But perhaps there is a smaller k? Wait, k must be congruent to 9 mod17, so the minimal non-negative k is 9, so m=2+17*9=155. The next smaller k would be negative, which would give m negative, which we don't want. So 155 is indeed the minimal positive integer.\n\nWait, but let me check m=2 mod17. Let me check m=2. 2\u2074 +1=17, which is 17 mod289, so 17 mod289\u22600. So that's not divisible by289. Similarly, m=2+17=19. Let me check m=19. 19\u2074 +1 mod289.\n\nCompute 19 mod17 is 2, so 19=2+17*1. Let me compute 19^4 mod289. Let's compute 19\u00b2 first: 19\u00b2=361. 361 mod289 is 361-289=72. Then 19^4=(19\u00b2)^2=72\u00b2=5184. 5184 divided by289: 289*17=4913, 5184-4913=271. So 19^4 \u2261271 mod289. 271 +1=272\u2261-17 mod289, which is not 0. So that's not working.\n\nSimilarly, m=2+17*2=36. Let me compute 36^4 mod289. 36 mod17 is 36-2*17=2, so same as m=2 mod17. Let me compute 36\u00b2=1296. 1296 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1296-1156=140. Then 36^4=(36\u00b2)^2=140\u00b2=19600. 19600 divided by289: 289*67=289*(60+7)=289*60=17340 +289*7=2023 \u2192 total 17340+2023=19363. 19600-19363=237. So 36^4\u2261237 mod289. 237+1=238\u2261-51 mod289. Not zero.\n\nContinuing, m=2+17*3=53. Let me see 53 mod17 is 53-3*17=53-51=2. So same residue. Let me compute 53^4 mod289. 53\u00b2=2809. 2809 mod289: 289*9=2601, 2809-2601=208. Then 53^4=(53\u00b2)^2=208\u00b2=43264. 43264 divided by289: 289*149=289*(150-1)=289*150=43350 -289=43350-289=43061. 43264-43061=203. So 53^4\u2261203 mod289. 203+1=204\u2261-85 mod289. Not zero.\n\nSimilarly, m=2+17*4=70. 70 mod17 is 70-4*17=70-68=2. 70\u00b2=4900. 4900 mod289: 289*16=4624, 4900-4624=276. Then 70^4=276\u00b2=76176. 76176 divided by289: 289*263=289*(200+60+3)=289*200=57800 +289*60=17340 +289*3=867 \u2192 total 57800+17340=75140 +867=76007. 76176-76007=169. So 70^4\u2261169 mod289. 169+1=170\u2261-119 mod289. Not zero.\n\nContinuing, m=2+17*5=87. 87 mod17 is 87-5*17=87-85=2. 87\u00b2=7569. 7569 mod289: 289*26=7514, 7569-7514=55. Then 87^4=55\u00b2=3025. 3025 mod289: 289*10=2890, 3025-2890=135. 135+1=136\u2261-153 mod289. Not zero.\n\nm=2+17*6=104. 104 mod17: 104-6*17=104-102=2. 104\u00b2=10816. 10816 mod289: 289*37=289*(30+7)=8670 +2023=10693. 10816-10693=123. 104^4=123\u00b2=15129. 15129 mod289: 289*52=15028, 15129-15028=101. 101+1=102\u2261-187 mod289. Not zero.\n\nm=2+17*7=121. 121 mod17: 121-7*17=121-119=2. 121\u00b2=14641. 14641 mod289: 289*50=14450, 14641-14450=191. 121^4=191\u00b2=36481. 36481 mod289: 289*126=289*(100+20+6)=28900 +5780 +1734=28900+5780=34680+1734=36414. 36481-36414=67. 67+1=68\u2261-221 mod289. Not zero.\n\nm=2+17*8=138. 138 mod17: 138-8*17=138-136=2. 138\u00b2=19044. 19044 mod289: 289*65=289*(60+5)=17340 +1445=18785. 19044-18785=259. 138^4=259\u00b2=67081. 67081 mod289: Let's see 289*232=289*(200+32)=57800 +9248=67048. 67081-67048=33. 33+1=34\u2261-255 mod289. Not zero.\n\nm=2+17*9=155. As before, 155^4\u2261-1 mod289. So that works. So indeed, m=155 is the first one that works. Therefore, the minimal m is 155.\n\nWait, but let me check if there is a smaller m not of the form 2 +17k. Since Hensel's lemma gives a unique solution mod17\u00b2, so the solution mod289 is unique mod17. Since the original solution mod17 was 2 mod17, the solution mod289 must be \u22612 mod17. Therefore, all solutions are of the form 2 +17k, so the minimal positive solution is indeed 155. Therefore, the answer is 155.\n\nBut let me check m=155 is indeed the minimal. Let me check m=2,19,36,53,70,87,104,121,138,155. The first 9 terms don't work, and the 10th term (k=9) works. So 155 is the minimal. Therefore, the answer is 155. So the prime p is 17, and the minimal m is 155. Therefore, the problem asks for the minimal m once p is found, so the final answer is 155.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there is a smaller m not congruent to 2 mod17. Suppose there exists another solution not in the form 2 +17k. But according to Hensel's lemma, since the derivative at n=2 mod17 was non-zero (we had f'(2)=4*(2)^3=32\u226115 mod17\u22600), so the solution lifts uniquely. Therefore, there is exactly one solution mod17\u00b2 congruent to 2 mod17, which is 155. Therefore, there are no other solutions mod289 outside of that congruence class, so 155 is indeed minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 155. Wait, but let me check with m= 17\u00b2 -155 =289-155=134. Maybe negative numbers? But m must be positive. Alternatively, perhaps m= something smaller?\n\nWait, 155 is less than 17\u00b2=289, so it's within the modulus. Since the solutions are unique mod289, the minimal positive solution is 155. Therefore, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{155}\n</think>\n\nTo find the least prime number \\( p \\) such that there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) where \\( n^4 + 1 \\) is divisible by \\( p^2 \\), we start by noting that \\( p \\) must be an odd prime. For \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p^2} \\), the order of \\( n \\) modulo \\( p^2 \\) must be 8, implying \\( 8 \\) divides \\( p(p-1) \\). Since \\( p \\) is odd, \\( p-1 \\) must be divisible by 8. The smallest such prime is \\( p = 17 \\).\n\nNext, we verify that \\( n = 2 \\) modulo 17 is a solution to \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17} \\). Using Hensel's lemma, we lift this solution to modulo \\( 17^2 \\). We express \\( m \\) as \\( 2 + 17k \\) and solve for \\( k \\) such that \\( (2 + 17k)^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{289} \\).\n\nExpanding \\( (2 + 17k)^4 \\) modulo 289, we find:\n\\[\n(2 + 17k)^4 \\equiv 16 + 255k \\pmod{289}\n\\]\nSetting this congruent to \\(-1 \\pmod{289}\\), we solve:\n\\[\n255k \\equiv -17 \\pmod{289}\n\\]\nDividing by 17, we get:\n\\[\n15k \\equiv 16 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\nThe solution to this congruence is \\( k \\equiv 9 \\pmod{17} \\). The smallest non-negative \\( k \\) is 9, giving \\( m = 2 + 17 \\times 9 = 155 \\).\n\nVerification shows \\( 155^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{289} \\), confirming \\( m = 155 \\) is the minimal solution.\n\nThus, the least positive integer \\( m \\) is \\(\\boxed{155}\\)."

For \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p^2} \\), the order of \\( n \\) modulo \\( p^2 \\) must be 8, implying \\( 8 \\) divides \\( p(p-1) \\). Since \\( p \\) is odd, \\( p-1 \\) must be divisible by 8. The smallest such prime is \\( p = 17 \\).\n\nNext, we verify that \\( n = 2 \\) modulo 17 is a solution to \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17} \\). Using Hensel's lemma, we lift this solution to modulo \\( 17^2 \\). We express \\( m \\) as \\( 2 + 17k \\) and solve for \\( k \\) such that \\( (2 + 17k)^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{289} \\).\n\nExpanding \\( (2 + 17k)^4 \\) modulo 289, we find:\n\\[\n(2 + 17k)^4 \\equiv 16 + 255k \\pmod{289}\n\\]\nSetting this congruent to \\(-1 \\pmod{289}\\), we solve:\n\\[\n255k \\equiv -17 \\pmod{289}\n\\]\nDividing by 17, we get:\n\\[\n15k \\equiv 16 \\pmod{17}\n\\]\nThe solution to this congruence is \\( k \\equiv 9 \\pmod{17} \\). The smallest non-negative \\( k \\) is 9, giving \\( m = 2 + 17 \\times 9 = 155 \\).\n\nVerification shows \\( 155^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{289} \\), confirming \\( m = 155 \\) is the minimal solution.\n\nThus, the least positive integer \\( m \\) is \\(\\boxed{155}\\).",
