        "question": "ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?\nA. At active promoters and enhancers\nB. At random locations in the genome\nC. In the introns of large genes\nD. At repeats",
        "response": "The most likely explanation for the disappearing peaks when PFA+DSG fixation is used is that these peaks are associated with regions of the genome that are sensitive to the fixation method. DSG (disuccinimidyl glutarate) is a crosslinking agent that stabilizes protein-protein interactions, and its use in combination with PFA (paraformaldehyde) can alter the accessibility or stability of certain protein-DNA interactions.\n\nGiven this context, the disappearing peaks are most likely to be found at regions where IKAROS interacts with chromatin in a way that is disrupted or masked by the PFA+DSG fixation. IKAROS is a transcription factor known to regulate gene expression, particularly in immune cells like B cells, and it often binds to active promoters and enhancers.\n\n**Answer: A. At active promoters and enhancers**\n\nThese regions are dynamic and sensitive to changes in chromatin structure and protein-DNA interactions, which could be affected by the fixation method. Random locations in the genome (B), introns of large genes (C), or repeats (D) are less likely to be specifically affected by the fixation method in this context."
