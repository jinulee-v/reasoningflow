        "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out this NMR problem. So, we have a mixture of two aromatic compounds with molecular formula C10H14 in a 1:1 ratio. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are different combinations of tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene. \n\nFirst, let's recall that aromatic protons in substituted benzene rings can show different splitting patterns based on the substituents' positions. If the substituents are symmetrical, the aromatic protons might be equivalent, leading to a singlet. For example, para-substituted benzene derivatives often have equivalent protons, resulting in a singlet. Ortho and meta substituents can lead to more complex splitting, but if there's enough symmetry, maybe they can still be singlets.\n\nLooking at the options given:\n\n1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\n2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n4. 1,4-diethylbenzene\n\nAll these compounds have four substituents (either methyl or ethyl groups) on the benzene ring. Let's analyze each compound's structure and predict their NMR spectra.\n\nStarting with 1,4-diethylbenzene. The benzene ring has two ethyl groups in the para positions. The aromatic protons would be in the para positions relative to the ethyl groups. Wait, no\u2014if the ethyl groups are at 1 and 4 positions (which are para to each other), then the remaining positions (2,3,5,6) would each have hydrogen atoms. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1 and 4 are para. So substituents at 1 and 4 would leave positions 2,3,5,6. But ethyl groups are bulky, but symmetry-wise, the aromatic protons might be equivalent. Let me draw this mentally. If there are ethyl groups at 1 and 4, then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the ethyl group (ortho), positions 3 and 5 are meta. Wait, but actually, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the remaining protons are in two sets: ortho and meta. Wait, no\u2014if substituents are para, then the adjacent positions (ortho) would be equivalent, and the meta positions would be equivalent. Wait, but with two substituents, para to each other, the aromatic protons would be in two pairs: ortho (positions 2 and 6) and meta (positions 3 and 5). Each pair would be equivalent. So, in that case, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets? Or maybe if there's symmetry, perhaps they are equivalent? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. For example, para-xylene (dimethylbenzene) has two methyl groups para. The aromatic protons are in two sets: two protons ortho to the methyl groups and two protons meta. But in para-xylene, the ortho protons are equivalent, and the meta protons are equivalent. So, their NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to two protons. But wait, para-xylene actually has equivalent protons because of the symmetry. Wait, no, para-xylene has two methyl groups opposite each other. The remaining protons are at ortho and meta positions. Wait, no\u2014if the methyl groups are at positions 1 and 4, then the adjacent positions (2 and 5) are ortho, and positions 3 and 6 are meta. Wait, but para-xylene's structure is such that the remaining protons are actually equivalent. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check: para-xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene) has two methyl groups. The aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to methyl groups (ortho), and positions 3 and 5 are meta. But due to the symmetry of the para substitution, the ortho protons (2 and 6) are equivalent, and the meta protons (3 and 5) are equivalent. Therefore, the NMR would show two doublets: one for the ortho protons and one for the meta protons. However, in reality, para-xylene actually shows a singlet because all aromatic protons are equivalent? Wait, no. Wait, para-xylene's aromatic protons: positions 2 and 6 are ortho to methyl, and positions 3 and 5 are meta. But due to the symmetry, the chemical environment of protons at 2 and 6 is the same, and protons at 3 and 5 are the same. However, they are not equivalent. Wait, but maybe in para-xylene, the ring's symmetry makes all aromatic protons equivalent? Wait, no. Wait, para-xylene has D2h symmetry. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent by the vertical mirror plane, and protons at 3 and 5 are equivalent. But these two sets (ortho and meta) are not equivalent to each other. Therefore, para-xylene's NMR should have two signals. But I think in reality, para-xylene actually has a singlet because of rapid rotation around the ring? Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up with something else. Wait, para-xylene's protons are split into two doublets because the coupling between ortho and meta protons. But in reality, para-xylene's NMR is a singlet? Wait, I need to recall. Let me check: para-xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene) has equivalent aromatic protons? No, because each proton is adjacent to a methyl group, but the positions are not all equivalent. Wait, but maybe due to the symmetry, the chemical shifts are the same. Wait, no. For example, in toluene, the ortho, meta, and para protons have different chemical shifts. But in para-xylene, the ortho protons (to the methyl) would be deshielded more than the meta protons. Therefore, para-xylene's NMR should have two signals: one for the ortho protons and one for the meta protons. But I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe the coupling between protons leads to a more complex splitting, but in the problem statement, the aromatic signals are singlets. So, if the compound has symmetry such that all aromatic protons are equivalent, then they would be a singlet. For example, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5 positions. Let's see: benzene ring with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. That would leave positions 3 and 6. Are those equivalent? Let's visualize: positions 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (H), 4 (methyl), 5 (methyl), 6 (H). So positions 3 and 6 are opposite each other. Are they equivalent? If the molecule has a center of inversion, then yes. Let's see: if you invert the molecule, position 1 becomes 4, 2 becomes 5, 3 becomes 6. Since methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5, inversion swaps 1 and 4, 2 and 5. So positions 3 and 6 are swapped. Therefore, protons at 3 and 6 are equivalent. Therefore, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the aromatic protons are at positions 3 and 6, which are equivalent due to symmetry, so they would be a singlet. Similarly, if another compound has aromatic protons as a singlet, then their NMR would show a singlet. \n\nIn the problem, the mixture has two singlets in aromatic region (6.7 ppm) in 1:1 ratio. That suggests that each compound contributes one singlet each, each with equal integration (since the mixture is 1:1). So each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons, hence a singlet. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\n1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: as above, two aromatic protons (positions 3 and 6) which are equivalent, so a singlet.\n\n1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Let's see: positions 4 and 6 have H. Are they equivalent? Let's check symmetry. The molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. Position 4 is between 3 and 5 (which are both methyl), and position 6 is between 5 and 1. Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize: benzene ring with methyl at 1,2,3,5. So positions 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (methyl), 4 (H), 5 (methyl), 6 (H). Positions 4 and 6: position 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and 5, while position 6 is adjacent to methyl at 5 and 1. Are these equivalent? If there's a symmetry operation that swaps them. Let's see: maybe a rotation. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, a mirror plane through position 4 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. Therefore, the aromatic protons would be two singlets? Or maybe they are equivalent. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Position 4 is between 3 and 5 (both methyl), position 6 is between 5 and 1 (methyl at 5 and 1). So position 4 is adjacent to two methyl groups (positions 3 and 5), whereas position 6 is adjacent to methyl at 5 and 1. Since substituents at 1,2,3,5, the environment of position 4 and 6 might be different. Therefore, the protons at 4 and 6 would be non-equivalent, leading to two separate signals. But in the problem, each compound contributes one singlet. So if 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two non-equivalent aromatic protons, then its NMR would show two signals, which doesn't match the problem statement. Therefore, this compound might not be one of the two in the mixture.\n\nNext, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. The remaining positions are 5 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let's see: positions 5 and 6. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 5 (H). Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,4. So position 5 is next to methyl at 4, position 6 is next to methyl at 1. Are these equivalent? If there's a mirror plane or rotation axis. The molecule has methyl groups at four consecutive positions (1,2,3,4). So positions 5 and 6 are across from each other. If there's a mirror plane through the center of the ring perpendicular to the plane, swapping positions 5 and 6. But with four methyl groups in a row, the molecule is probably not symmetrical enough to make positions 5 and 6 equivalent. Therefore, protons at 5 and 6 would be non-equivalent, leading to two signals. Therefore, this compound would have two aromatic signals, which doesn't fit the problem's two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (each compound contributing one singlet). So maybe this isn't the right compound.\n\n1,4-diethylbenzene: substituents are ethyl groups at 1 and 4 (para). The remaining aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. As discussed earlier, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the aromatic protons are in two sets: ortho and meta. But ethyl groups are bulkier, but symmetry-wise, similar to methyl. However, ethyl groups are stronger electron-donating groups. Wait, but regardless, the key is whether the aromatic protons are equivalent. For para-diethylbenzene, the protons ortho to the ethyl groups (positions 2 and 6) and meta (positions 3 and 5). Are these equivalent? Due to the para substitution, the ortho protons (2 and 6) are equivalent, and the meta protons (3 and 5) are equivalent. Therefore, the NMR would show two signals: one for the ortho protons and one for the meta protons. But in the problem, the aromatic region has two singlets in 1:1 ratio. If 1,4-diethylbenzene has two sets of protons (ortho and meta), each as a singlet? Wait, no. Each set would be a doublet due to coupling between adjacent protons. Wait, but if the coupling is between equivalent protons, maybe it's a singlet? No, coupling between protons that are adjacent would lead to splitting. For example, in para-xylene, the ortho protons couple with the meta protons, leading to a doublet of doublets or something. But maybe in para-diethylbenzene, the splitting is more complex. However, the problem states that the aromatic signals are singlets. Therefore, if 1,4-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons are not equivalent, leading to multiplets, then it wouldn't contribute a singlet. Therefore, maybe 1,4-diethylbenzene isn't the right compound. Wait, but wait\u2014if the substituents are such that all aromatic protons are equivalent. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make all aromatic protons equivalent. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) has three methyl groups, leading to equivalent aromatic protons and a singlet. But in our case, 1,4-diethylbenzene has two substituents. Unless there's some accidental equivalence, but I don't think so. Therefore, maybe 1,4-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons are split into two signals, which would not match the problem's two singlets. Therefore, perhaps 1,4-diethylbenzene is not one of the compounds.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again. Option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. If 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic protons (positions 4 and 6), which are not equivalent, leading to two signals, but the problem says each compound contributes one singlet. So maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's re-examine 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. The remaining positions are 4 and 6. Position 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to methyl at 5 and 1. Are these environments equivalent? Let's imagine rotating the molecule. If we rotate the ring 120 degrees, does position 4 become position 6? Probably not. Alternatively, is there a plane of symmetry? If the molecule has a mirror plane that swaps positions 4 and 6. Let's see: substituents at 1,2,3,5. If we draw the benzene ring with positions 1 (top), 2 (right top), 3 (right bottom), 4 (bottom), 5 (left bottom), 6 (left top). Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So positions 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (methyl), 5 (methyl), leaving 4 and 6. If there's a mirror plane vertical through position 1 and 4, then positions 2 and 6 would be mirrored, but since positions 2 and 6 have methyl and H respectively, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe a diagonal mirror plane. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent, leading to two separate signals. Therefore, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would have two aromatic protons as two singlets? Or maybe they are split into multiplets. But the problem states that the aromatic region has two singlets in 1:1 ratio. So each compound must contribute one singlet each. Therefore, both compounds must have only one set of equivalent aromatic protons. \n\nLooking back at 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Remaining positions 3 and 6. These are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry (center of inversion?), so their protons are a singlet. So that's one compound with a singlet in aromatic region.\n\nAnother compound could be 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested it has two sets of aromatic protons. However, maybe I was wrong. Let's think again: para-diethylbenzene. The ethyl groups are at 1 and 4. The aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are ortho to ethyl groups, positions 3 and 5 are meta. Are the ortho protons equivalent to each other, and the meta protons equivalent? Yes, due to the para symmetry. So the ortho protons (2 and 6) are equivalent, and the meta protons (3 and 5) are equivalent. Therefore, the NMR would show two signals: one for ortho and one for meta. But the problem states that there are two singlets in the aromatic region, each in 1:1 ratio. If the mixture has two compounds, each contributing one singlet, then each compound must have only one set of aromatic protons. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of them because it would contribute two signals. Therefore, maybe the other compound is another tetramethylbenzene that also has a singlet in the aromatic region.\n\nLooking at 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. Remaining positions 5 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let's see. If the molecule has a mirror plane through positions 5 and 6, swapping 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Since substituents are at 1,2,3,4, which are all methyl, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to methyl groups. Position 5 is next to methyl at 4, position 6 is next to methyl at 1. If there's a mirror plane through the center of the ring, swapping positions 5 and 6, then they would be equivalent. But with four methyl groups in a row (1,2,3,4), the molecule is not symmetrical enough. Therefore, positions 5 and 6 are not equivalent, leading to two signals. So this compound would have two aromatic signals, which doesn't fit.\n\n1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Remaining positions 4 and 6. As discussed earlier, these might not be equivalent, leading to two signals. Therefore, this compound also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. If both of these compounds have two aromatic signals each, then the mixture would have four signals in the aromatic region, which contradicts the problem's two signals. Therefore, option A is unlikely.\n\nOption B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The first compound has one aromatic singlet, the second has two signals. So total aromatic signals would be three, which contradicts the problem's two signals. So B is out.\n\nOption C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. First compound has one singlet, second compound has two signals. Total three signals. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Both have two aromatic signals each. Total four signals. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, this is confusing. The problem states that the aromatic region has two singlets in 1:1 ratio. That suggests that each compound contributes one singlet, each integrating to the same number of protons. Since the mixture is 1:1, the integration ratio of the two singlets would be 1:1 if each compound has the same number of aromatic protons. For example, if one compound has two aromatic protons (as in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) and the other also has two aromatic protons (but in a different arrangement), then each singlet would integrate to 2 protons each, but since the mixture is 1:1, the total integration would be 1:1. Wait, but the integration ratio in the problem is 1:1 for the aromatic signals. So if each compound contributes one singlet, and each singlet corresponds to the same number of protons, then in a 1:1 mixture, the integrals would be the same. For example, compound A has 2 aromatic protons (singlet), compound B has 2 aromatic protons (singlet). In a 1:1 mixture, each singlet would integrate to 2*(1/2) = 1 each? Wait, no. If the mixture is 1:1 molar ratio, then for each mole of compound A and compound B, the aromatic protons would be 2 from A and 2 from B. So total 4 protons, but each singlet would be from each compound, so each singlet would integrate to 2 protons each. But the problem says the ratio is 1:1. Wait, maybe the integration is relative. If each compound contributes one singlet, and each singlet has the same number of protons, then their integrals would be in the ratio of their molar ratios multiplied by the number of protons. Since the mixture is 1:1, and each singlet corresponds to the same number of protons (say 2 each), then the integrals would be 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. So that fits the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, we need two compounds each with one singlet in the aromatic region, each singlet corresponding to 2 protons. Let's check which compounds satisfy this.\n\n1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: 2 aromatic protons (positions 3 and 6), equivalent, singlet. So that's one compound.\n\nAnother compound could be 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested it has two sets of aromatic protons. But maybe I was wrong. Let's think again. If 1,4-diethylbenzene has ethyl groups at para positions, the aromatic protons are at ortho and meta positions. Are these equivalent? Wait, ethyl groups are larger, but symmetry-wise, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent, and meta protons (positions 3 and 5) are equivalent. So two sets of protons. Therefore, two signals. But the problem has two singlets, so this doesn't fit. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not the right compound.\n\nWait, maybe another tetramethylbenzene. Let's check 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons (positions 5 and 6). Are they equivalent? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry making them equivalent. If substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to methyl groups. Position 5 is next to methyl at 4, position 6 is next to methyl at 1. If there's a mirror plane through positions 5 and 6, swapping 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Since substituents are at 1,2,3,4, which are all methyl, this mirror plane would make positions 5 and 6 equivalent. Therefore, their protons would be a singlet. Wait, is that possible? Let me visualize. If the molecule has a mirror plane through the axis passing through positions 5 and 6, then swapping positions 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Since positions 1,2,3,4 all have methyl groups, swapping them would leave the molecule unchanged. Therefore, positions 5 and 6 are mirror images of each other and thus equivalent. Therefore, their protons would be a singlet. So 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet for aromatic protons. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought positions 5 and 6 were not equivalent, but maybe with this mirror plane, they are. Let me confirm. If there's a vertical mirror plane through positions 5 and 6, then positions 1 and 4 are mirrored, as are 2 and 3. Since all those positions have methyl groups, the mirror plane symmetry holds. Therefore, positions 5 and 6 are equivalent under this symmetry operation. Therefore, their protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet. Therefore, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet in the aromatic region. \n\nSimilarly, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene also has a singlet. Therefore, if the mixture contains these two compounds, each would contribute a singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2 protons each. Since the mixture is 1:1, the ratio of the integrals would be 1:1. That matches the problem statement. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Both would have singlets in the aromatic region. So that fits the aromatic signals part.\n\nNow, let's check the methyl signals. The problem states three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, let's analyze the methyl groups in each compound.\n\nFor 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. Let's see if they are equivalent. Positions 1 and 4 are para to each other, positions 2 and 5 are para. Are the methyl groups at 1 and 4 equivalent? Yes, due to the mirror plane. Similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent. Therefore, there are two sets of methyl groups: those at 1/4 and those at 2/5. Each set has two methyl groups. Therefore, the NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups, each integrating to 2 methyl groups (but since there are four methyl groups in total, two sets of two). However, wait, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, all methyl groups might not be equivalent. Let's see: positions 1 and 4 are para, positions 2 and 5 are para. Are the methyl groups at 1/4 different from those at 2/5? Let's consider the environment. Each methyl group is adjacent to two other methyl groups. For example, methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and methyl at 5 (since it's a benzene ring). Wait, no. In a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to two others. Position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Wait, no. Let me correct:\n\nIn benzene, each position is adjacent to its two immediate neighbors. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1.\n\nIn 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. So:\n\n- Methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n- Methyl at 2 is adjacent to methyl at 1 and methyl at 3 (but wait, position 3 is H, since substituents are at 1,2,4,5. Wait, no: substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So position 3 is H. Therefore, methyl at 2 is adjacent to methyl at 1 and H at 3.\n- Methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl at 5 and H at 3.\n- Methyl at 5 is adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's list the adjacent groups for each methyl:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 (position 2) and H at 6 (position 6).\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to methyl at 1 (position 1) and H at 3 (position 3).\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to methyl at 5 (position 5) and H at 3 (position 3).\n- Methyl at 5: adjacent to methyl at 4 (position 4) and H at 6 (position 6).\n\nSo methyl groups at 1 and 5: methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (6). Methyl at 5 is adjacent to methyl (4) and H (6). Are these environments equivalent? Not necessarily. Similarly, methyl at 2 and 4: methyl at 2 is adjacent to methyl (1) and H (3). Methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl (5) and H (3). Are these equivalent? If there's a mirror plane swapping positions 1 and 5, 2 and 4, then yes. Let's see: the molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. A mirror plane through positions 3 and 6 would swap positions 1 and 5, 2 and 4. Therefore, methyl at 1 and 5 would be equivalent, and methyl at 2 and 4 would be equivalent. Therefore, there are two sets of methyl groups: positions 1 and 5 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H), and positions 2 and 4 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H). Wait, but under the mirror plane, methyl 1 and 5 are swapped, as are 2 and 4. Therefore, the environments of methyl 1 and 5 are equivalent, and methyl 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, the NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups: one for positions 1 and 5 (two methyl groups), and one for positions 2 and 4 (two methyl groups). So two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. But the problem states three signals at 2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio. Therefore, this compound alone would contribute two singlets. \n\nNow, the other compound in option C is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its methyl groups. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. Each methyl group is adjacent to two other methyl groups? Let's see:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and methyl at 6 (but position 6 is H). Wait, no. Position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Since substituents are at 1,2,3,4:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to methyl at 1 and methyl at 3.\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to methyl at 2 and methyl at 4.\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5.\n\nSo each methyl group's environment:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl (2) and H (6).\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl (1) and methyl (3).\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl (2) and methyl (4).\n- Methyl 4: adjacent to methyl (3) and H (5).\n\nAre any of these equivalent? Let's check symmetry. The molecule has methyl groups at consecutive positions 1,2,3,4. This creates a structure where positions 1 and 4 are at the ends, and 2 and 3 are in the middle. \n\nIf there's a mirror plane through the center of the ring (between positions 3 and 4), swapping positions 1 and 4, 2 and 3. However, methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be swapped. Methyl at 1 (adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6) and methyl at 4 (adjacent to methyl 3 and H 5). If positions 5 and 6 are H, then under this mirror plane, methyl 1 and 4 are not equivalent because their adjacent groups differ. Methyl 1 is next to methyl 2 and H 6, methyl 4 is next to methyl 3 and H 5. Unless positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, which they aren't in this case. Therefore, methyl 1 and 4 are not equivalent. Similarly, methyl 2 and 3: methyl 2 is adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3, methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and methyl 4. These might be equivalent if there's a mirror plane swapping 2 and 3. But since the molecule is asymmetrical, probably not. Therefore, each methyl group is in a unique environment, leading to four signals. But wait, maybe some are equivalent. Let's see:\n\nMethyl 2 and methyl 3: methyl 2 is between methyl 1 and methyl 3, methyl 3 is between methyl 2 and methyl 4. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry swapping 2 and 3, but given the consecutive methyl groups, this seems unlikely. Therefore, methyl 2 and 3 are not equivalent. Similarly, methyl 1 and 4 are not equivalent. Therefore, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have four distinct methyl signals. But the problem states three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. Therefore, this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but maybe there is some equivalence. Let me think again. If the molecule has a mirror plane through position 2.5 and 5.5 (imaginary positions), swapping positions 1 and 4, 2 and 3. If this mirror plane exists, then methyl 1 and 4 would be equivalent, and methyl 2 and 3 would be equivalent. However, in reality, with four consecutive methyl groups, the molecule is likely to be asymmetrical. Therefore, methyl groups would have different environments. Therefore, four signals. But the problem has three signals. Therefore, option C can't be correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says three signals at 2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio. So total integration of 4 protons (2+1+1). Wait, methyl groups are -CH3, so each singlet corresponds to a certain number of methyl groups. For example, if one compound has two methyl groups in one environment, and the other compound has two methyl groups split into two environments, then total signals would be three. Let's see:\n\nIf one compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) has two sets of methyl groups (two and two), contributing two singlets. The other compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene) has four methyl groups in four environments, but maybe some overlap. Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Let's try another approach.\n\nThe problem states that there are three singlets in the methyl region (around 2.2 ppm) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's assume that each singlet corresponds to a set of methyl groups. The total integration is 2+1+1=4, which corresponds to four methyl groups. Since each compound has four methyl groups (tetramethylbenzene) or two ethyl groups (diethylbenzene, which would have CH2CH3 groups, but ethyl groups would show up as quartets or something else, not singlets). Wait, the options include 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has two ethyl groups. Ethyl groups have CH2CH3. The CH2 groups would be split into quartets by the adjacent CH3, but the problem states that all the signals at 2.2 ppm are singlets. Therefore, the signals at 2.2 ppm must be from methyl groups (not ethyl), since ethyl groups would show up as multiplets. Therefore, the three signals at 2.2 ppm are from methyl groups, and the two compounds must be tetramethylbenzenes. Because diethylbenzene's ethyl groups would not contribute singlets at 2.2 ppm. Therefore, the mixture must be two tetramethylbenzenes. Therefore, options B, C, D are possible, and option A is out because it includes diethylbenzene.\n\nNow, focusing on options B, C, D. Each option has two tetramethylbenzenes. We need to determine which pair would give three methyl singlets in 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. As discussed earlier, methyl groups split into two sets: positions 1/5 and 2/4, each integrating to two methyl groups. So two singlets.\n\nSecond compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its methyl groups. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. The methyl groups are at these positions. Each methyl's adjacent groups:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to methyl 4 (but position 4 is H) and H 6. Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Position 4 is H, position 6 is H. Wait, methyl at 5 is adjacent to H at 4 and H at 6? No, methyl at 5 is adjacent to position 4 (H) and position 6 (H). Wait, no: in benzene, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. If methyl is at 5, then it's adjacent to positions 4 and 6. But substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So methyl at 5 is adjacent to H at 4 and H at 6. Therefore, methyl at 5 is adjacent to two H's. Methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6. Methyl at 2 is adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3. Methyl at 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4. \n\nSo environments:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl and H.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to two methyls.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl and H.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to two H's.\n\nAre any of these equivalent? Let's check symmetry. The molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. Let's see if there's a mirror plane. If we have a mirror plane through methyl 5 and position 4, swapping positions 1 and 3. Methyl 1 and 3 would be mirrored. However, methyl 1 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6, methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4. If positions 4 and 6 are H, then methyl 1 and 3 are not equivalent. Therefore, methyl groups at 1,2,3,5 are all in different environments except possibly methyl 1 and 3. But as above, they are not equivalent. Methyl 5 is adjacent to two H's, unique environment. Therefore, this compound would have four methyl signals. But combined with the first compound's two signals, the total would be 2 + 4 = 6 signals, which contradicts the problem's three signals. Therefore, option B is out.\n\nOption C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst compound: two methyl signals.\n\nSecond compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. As discussed earlier, likely four methyl signals. Total signals: 2 + 4 = 6. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nBoth compounds would have four methyl signals each. Total 8 signals. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, this is not working. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the ethyl groups in option A are not contributing. Let's reconsider option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nIf the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene are contributing to the methyl signals. Wait, ethyl groups have CH2CH3. The CH3 groups would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. But the problem states that all the signals at 2.2 ppm are singlets. Therefore, ethyl groups' CH3 would not be singlets, so they must not be the source of these signals. Therefore, the three singlets at 2.2 ppm must be from the methyl groups of the tetramethylbenzenes. Therefore, the mixture must contain two tetramethylbenzenes whose methyl groups contribute three singlets in total.\n\nBut earlier analysis suggests that none of the options B, C, D give three signals. This is confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the methyl groups of the compounds.\n\nLet's take option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups: as discussed, four different environments? Or maybe some are equivalent. Let's try again.\n\nMethyl groups at 1,2,3,5.\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to H 4 and H 6.\n\nAre any of these equivalent? Let's check for symmetry. If there's a mirror plane through position 5 and the center of the ring, swapping positions 1 and 3, 2 and 6. But methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Swapping 1 and 3 would swap methyl 1 and 3. Methyl 1 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6; methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4. Unless positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, which they aren't, methyl 1 and 3 are not equivalent. Methyl 5 is adjacent to H 4 and H 6, unique. Methyl 2 is adjacent to two methyls. Therefore, four different environments. So four methyl signals. \n\n1,4-diethylbenzene's ethyl groups: the CH2CH3 groups. The CH2 would be a quartet and the CH3 a triplet, but these would appear in the NMR, but the problem states that the signals at 2.2 ppm are singlets. Therefore, ethyl groups are not contributing to these signals. Therefore, the three signals at 2.2 ppm must come from the tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups. But 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl signals, which combined with nothing from the diethylbenzene, would give four signals. Doesn't match the problem's three. Therefore, option A is out.\n\nThis suggests that none of the options are correct, which can't be. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back to the original problem. The molecular formula is C10H14. For tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 \u2192 C10H14. Correct. For 1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(CH2CH3)2 \u2192 C10H14. Correct.\n\nThe aromatic signals are two singlets in 1:1 ratio. So each compound must have one singlet. We determined that 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one singlet. Which other compound has one singlet?\n\nLooking at 1,4-diethylbenzene: earlier analysis suggested two signals, but maybe I was wrong. Let's think again. If the ethyl groups are para, the aromatic protons might be equivalent due to symmetry. Wait, no. The ethyl groups are at para positions, so the remaining protons are ortho and meta to the ethyl groups. Ortho protons are adjacent to ethyl, meta are next to ortho. But due to the para substitution, the ortho protons are equivalent, and the meta protons are equivalent. Therefore, two signals. But the problem has two singlets, which would require each compound to have one singlet. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be the answer.\n\nWait, maybe another compound. Let's check 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene), but it's not in the options. The options only have tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene.\n\nWait, the problem says the mixture contains two aromatic compounds. The options are combinations of tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene. We need to find two compounds where each has one aromatic singlet.\n\nFrom earlier analysis:\n\n- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: one singlet (positions 3 and 6).\n- 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: if positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry, one singlet.\n- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: two signals.\n- 1,4-diethylbenzene: two signals.\n\nEarlier I thought that 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene might have a singlet if positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Let's confirm this. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. Positions 5 and 6 remaining. If there's a mirror plane through positions 5 and 6, swapping 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Since all those positions have methyl groups, swapping them leaves the molecule unchanged. Therefore, positions 5 and 6 are mirror images and thus equivalent. Therefore, their protons are a singlet. Therefore, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have one aromatic singlet. \n\nSimilarly, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic singlet. Therefore, option C (these two compounds) would have two singlets in the aromatic region, each from each compound. That fits the problem's aromatic signals.\n\nNow, the methyl signals. For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: methyl groups split into two sets (positions 1/5 and 2/4), two singlets.\n\nFor 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: methyl groups. Let's analyze again. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. Each methyl's adjacent groups:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl 2 and methyl 4.\n- Methyl 4: adjacent to methyl 3 and H 5.\n\nAre any of these equivalent? Due to the mirror plane through positions 5 and 6:\n\n- Methyl 1 and methyl 4: methyl 1 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6; methyl 4 is adjacent to methyl 3 and H 5. If positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the mirror plane, then H 5 and H 6 are equivalent. Therefore, methyl 1 and 4 are in equivalent environments (each adjacent to a methyl and an H). Similarly, methyl 2 and methyl 3: methyl 2 is adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3; methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and methyl 4. But under the mirror plane, methyl 2 and 3 are swapped. However, their environments are different: methyl 2 is adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3, methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and methyl 4. If methyl 1 and 4 are equivalent, then methyl 2 and 3 might also be equivalent. Let's see:\n\nIf methyl 1 and 4 are equivalent, and methyl 2 and 3 are equivalent, then the methyl groups would be in two sets: methyl 1/4 and methyl 2/3. Each set has two methyl groups. Therefore, two singlets. \n\nTherefore, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have two methyl singlets. \n\nTherefore, option C's two compounds would contribute 2 (from first compound) + 2 (from second compound) = 4 methyl signals. But the problem states three signals. Contradiction. \n\nWait, but maybe there's overlap between the methyl signals of the two compounds. For example, if one singlet from the first compound coincides with a singlet from the second compound. \n\nFor example, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl singlets (say A and B), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl singlets (say C and D). If one of A or B coincides with C or D, then total signals would be three. \n\nSuppose in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at positions 1/5 and 2/4 have different chemical shifts. In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at 1/4 and 2/3. If the chemical shift of methyl 1/5 in the first compound is the same as methyl 1/4 in the second compound, then they would overlap, contributing to one signal. Similarly, other overlaps might occur. \n\nBut this requires specific knowledge of the chemical shifts, which is beyond the scope of this analysis. However, the problem states that the three methyl signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's assume that one of the compounds contributes two methyl groups (integral 2) and the other contributes two methyl groups split into two integrals of 1 each. \n\nFor example, if 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes two methyl singlets (each integrating to 2), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two methyl singlets (each integrating to 2), but if one of the singlets overlaps, the total would be three signals: 2+2, 2, 2 \u2192 but integrals would be 4, 2, 2, which doesn't match the problem's 2:1:1. \n\nAlternatively, if one compound contributes two methyl groups (integral 2) and the other contributes two sets of methyl groups (integral 1 each), then total integrals would be 2,1,1. For example, if 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl groups in one environment (integral 2) and the other compound has two methyl groups split into two environments (1 each). But how?\n\nWait, maybe 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl groups (positions 1/5) integrating to 2, and two methyl groups (positions 2/4) integrating to 2. The other compound, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, has two methyl groups (positions 1/4) integrating to 2, and two methyl groups (positions 2/3) integrating to 2. If one of the signals overlaps (say positions 1/5 from the first compound and positions 1/4 from the second compound have the same shift), then the total integrals would be 2+2=4, and the other two signals would be 2 each. But the problem states 2:1:1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to consider that one of the compounds has three distinct methyl environments and the other has one, but that doesn't fit the options.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the answer choices again. The correct answer is likely option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Even though earlier analysis suggested issues, perhaps I missed something.\n\nIf the mixture contains 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:\n\n- Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic protons (positions 4 and 6), which might be equivalent due to symmetry. Wait, earlier analysis said they might not be, but maybe they are. If positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, then it would be a singlet. Similarly, 1,4-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons: if they are equivalent due to some symmetry, leading to a singlet. But earlier analysis suggested two signals. However, maybe in reality, para-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons are accidentally equivalent, leading to a singlet. For example, if the ethyl groups cause such a strong shielding that all aromatic protons have the same shift. Unlikely, but possible. If that's the case, then each compound contributes one singlet, totaling two, matching the problem.\n\nFor the methyl signals: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups. If they split into three environments: maybe two methyl groups in one environment, and one each in two others. For example, methyl groups at positions 1 and 5 (each adjacent to a methyl and a H), methyl groups at 2 and 3 (each adjacent to two methyls), but wait:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to H 4 and H 6.\n\nSo environments:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to one methyl and one H.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to two methyls.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to one methyl and one H.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to two H's.\n\nSo four different environments. Therefore, four signals. But the problem has three signals. Therefore, this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the problem's methyl signals are at 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in 2:1:1 ratio. The total integration is 4, which corresponds to four methyl groups. Since each tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups, and the mixture is 1:1, the total methyl groups would be eight. But the problem's integration sums to four, which suggests that only four methyl groups are contributing. This implies that one of the compounds is not a tetramethylbenzene but has fewer methyl groups. However, all options except A involve two tetramethylbenzenes. Option A has one tetramethylbenzene and one diethylbenzene. Diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups (CH2CH3), which contribute to the NMR but not as singlets. Therefore, the four methyl groups from the tetramethylbenzene would be the ones contributing to the methyl signals. If the tetramethylbenzene in option A (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) has four methyl groups split into three signals (2:1:1), that would fit. For example, two methyl groups in one environment, and one each in two others. Let's see:\n\nIf methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (integral 2), and methyl groups at 2 and 5 are unique (integral 1 each). But earlier analysis suggested four environments. However, maybe due to symmetry, methyl 1 and 3 are equivalent. Let's check:\n\nIf there's a mirror plane swapping positions 1 and 3, 2 and 5. If such a mirror plane exists, then methyl 1 and 3 would be equivalent, and methyl 2 and 5 would be equivalent. But methyl 2 is adjacent to two methyls, methyl 5 is adjacent to two H's. Therefore, they can't be equivalent. Therefore, methyl 1 and 3 are not equivalent. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the analysis, I think the correct answer is option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Even though earlier analysis suggested issues, perhaps the aromatic protons of 1,4-diethylbenzene are a singlet due to rapid rotation or accidental equivalence, and the methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene split into three signals (2:1:1). However, this is speculative. Alternatively, the correct answer is option C, but I can't reconcile the methyl signals. Given the problem's information, the most plausible answer is A."

            "text": "Therefore, this compound might not be one of the two in the mixture.\n\nNext, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. The remaining positions are 5 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let's see: positions 5 and 6. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 5 (H). Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,4. So position 5 is next to methyl at 4, position 6 is next to methyl at 1. Are these equivalent? If there's a mirror plane or rotation axis. The molecule has methyl groups at four consecutive positions (1,2,3,4). So positions 5 and 6 are across from each other. If there's a mirror plane through the center of the ring perpendicular to the plane, swapping positions 5 and 6. But with four methyl groups in a row, the molecule is probably not symmetrical enough to make positions 5 and 6 equivalent. Therefore, protons at 5 and 6 would be non-equivalent, leading to two signals. Therefore, this compound would have two aromatic signals, which doesn't fit the problem's two singlets in a 1:1 ratio (each compound contributing one singlet). So maybe this isn't the right compound.\n\n1,4-diethylbenzene: substituents are ethyl groups at 1 and 4 (para). The remaining aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. As discussed earlier, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the aromatic protons are in two sets: ortho and meta. But ethyl groups are bulkier, but symmetry-wise, similar to methyl. However, ethyl groups are stronger electron-donating groups. Wait, but regardless, the key is whether the aromatic protons are equivalent. For para-diethylbenzene, the protons ortho to the ethyl groups (positions 2 and 6) and meta (positions 3 and 5). Are these equivalent? Due to the para substitution, the ortho protons (2 and 6) are equivalent, and the meta protons (3 and 5) are equivalent. Therefore, the NMR would show two signals: one for the ortho protons and one for the meta protons. But in the problem, the aromatic region has two singlets in 1:1 ratio. If 1,4-diethylbenzene has two sets of protons (ortho and meta), each as a singlet? Wait, no. Each set would be a doublet due to coupling between adjacent protons. Wait, but if the coupling is between equivalent protons, maybe it's a singlet? No, coupling between protons that are adjacent would lead to splitting. For example, in para-xylene, the ortho protons couple with the meta protons, leading to a doublet of doublets or something. But maybe in para-diethylbenzene, the splitting is more complex. However, the problem states that the aromatic signals are singlets. Therefore, if 1,4-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons are not equivalent, leading to multiplets, then it wouldn't contribute a singlet. Therefore, maybe 1,4-diethylbenzene isn't the right compound. Wait, but wait\u2014if the substituents are such that all aromatic protons are equivalent. For example, if the substituents are in positions that make all aromatic protons equivalent. For example, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) has three methyl groups, leading to equivalent aromatic protons and a singlet. But in our case, 1,4-diethylbenzene has two substituents. Unless there's some accidental equivalence, but I don't think so. Therefore, maybe 1,4-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons are split into two signals, which would not match the problem's two singlets. Therefore, perhaps 1,4-diethylbenzene is not one of the compounds.\n\nWait, but let's check the options again. Option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. If 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic protons (positions 4 and 6), which are not equivalent, leading to two signals, but the problem says each compound contributes one singlet. So maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's re-examine 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. The remaining positions are 4 and 6. Position 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and 5. Position 6 is adjacent to methyl at 5 and 1. Are these environments equivalent? Let's imagine rotating the molecule. If we rotate the ring 120 degrees, does position 4 become position 6? Probably not. Alternatively, is there a plane of symmetry? If the molecule has a mirror plane that swaps positions 4 and 6. Let's see: substituents at 1,2,3,5. If we draw the benzene ring with positions 1 (top), 2 (right top), 3 (right bottom), 4 (bottom), 5 (left bottom), 6 (left top). Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So positions 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), 3 (methyl), 5 (methyl), leaving 4 and 6. If there's a mirror plane vertical through position 1 and 4, then positions 2 and 6 would be mirrored, but since positions 2 and 6 have methyl and H respectively, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe a diagonal mirror plane. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent, leading to two separate signals. Therefore, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would have two aromatic protons as two singlets? Or maybe they are split into multiplets. But the problem states that the aromatic region has two singlets in 1:1 ratio. So each compound must contribute one singlet each. Therefore, both compounds must have only one set of equivalent aromatic protons. \n\nLooking back at 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5. Remaining positions 3 and 6. These are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry (center of inversion?), so their protons are a singlet. So that's one compound with a singlet in aromatic region.\n\nAnother compound could be 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested it has two sets of aromatic protons. However, maybe I was wrong. Let's think again: para-diethylbenzene. The ethyl groups are at 1 and 4. The aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are ortho to ethyl groups, positions 3 and 5 are meta. Are the ortho protons equivalent to each other, and the meta protons equivalent? Yes, due to the para symmetry. So the ortho protons (2 and 6) are equivalent, and the meta protons (3 and 5) are equivalent. Therefore, the NMR would show two signals: one for ortho and one for meta. But the problem states that there are two singlets in the aromatic region, each in 1:1 ratio. If the mixture has two compounds, each contributing one singlet, then each compound must have only one set of aromatic protons. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be one of them because it would contribute two signals. Therefore, maybe the other compound is another tetramethylbenzene that also has a singlet in the aromatic region.\n\nLooking at 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4. Remaining positions 5 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let's see. If the molecule has a mirror plane through positions 5 and 6, swapping 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Since substituents are at 1,2,3,4, which are all methyl, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to methyl groups. Position 5 is next to methyl at 4, position 6 is next to methyl at 1. If there's a mirror plane through the center of the ring, swapping positions 5 and 6, then they would be equivalent. But with four methyl groups in a row (1,2,3,4), the molecule is not symmetrical enough. Therefore, positions 5 and 6 are not equivalent, leading to two signals. So this compound would have two aromatic signals, which doesn't fit.\n\n1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Remaining positions 4 and 6. As discussed earlier, these might not be equivalent, leading to two signals. Therefore, this compound also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. If both of these compounds have two aromatic signals each, then the mixture would have four signals in the aromatic region, which contradicts the problem's two signals. Therefore, option A is unlikely.\n\nOption B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The first compound has one aromatic singlet, the second has two signals. So total aromatic signals would be three, which contradicts the problem's two signals. So B is out.\n\nOption C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. First compound has one singlet, second compound has two signals. Total three signals. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Both have two aromatic signals each. Total four signals. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, this is confusing. The problem states that the aromatic region has two singlets in 1:1 ratio. That suggests that each compound contributes one singlet, each integrating to the same number of protons. Since the mixture is 1:1, the integration ratio of the two singlets would be 1:1 if each compound has the same number of aromatic protons. For example, if one compound has two aromatic protons (as in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) and the other also has two aromatic protons (but in a different arrangement), then each singlet would integrate to 2 protons each, but since the mixture is 1:1, the total integration would be 1:1. Wait, but the integration ratio in the problem is 1:1 for the aromatic signals. So if each compound contributes one singlet, and each singlet corresponds to the same number of protons, then in a 1:1 mixture, the integrals would be the same. For example, compound A has 2 aromatic protons (singlet), compound B has 2 aromatic protons (singlet). In a 1:1 mixture, each singlet would integrate to 2*(1/2) = 1 each? Wait, no. If the mixture is 1:1 molar ratio, then for each mole of compound A and compound B, the aromatic protons would be 2 from A and 2 from B. So total 4 protons, but each singlet would be from each compound, so each singlet would integrate to 2 protons each. But the problem says the ratio is 1:1. Wait, maybe the integration is relative. If each compound contributes one singlet, and each singlet has the same number of protons, then their integrals would be in the ratio of their molar ratios multiplied by the number of protons. Since the mixture is 1:1, and each singlet corresponds to the same number of protons (say 2 each), then the integrals would be 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. So that fits the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, we need two compounds each with one singlet in the aromatic region, each singlet corresponding to 2 protons. Let's check which compounds satisfy this.\n\n1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: 2 aromatic protons (positions 3 and 6), equivalent, singlet. So that's one compound.\n\nAnother compound could be 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested it has two sets of aromatic protons. But maybe I was wrong. Let's think again. If 1,4-diethylbenzene has ethyl groups at para positions, the aromatic protons are at ortho and meta positions. Are these equivalent? Wait, ethyl groups are larger, but symmetry-wise, the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent, and meta protons (positions 3 and 5) are equivalent. So two sets of protons. Therefore, two signals. But the problem has two singlets, so this doesn't fit. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene is not the right compound.\n\nWait, maybe another tetramethylbenzene. Let's check 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. It has two aromatic protons (positions 5 and 6). Are they equivalent? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry making them equivalent. If substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to methyl groups. Position 5 is next to methyl at 4, position 6 is next to methyl at 1. If there's a mirror plane through positions 5 and 6, swapping 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Since substituents are at 1,2,3,4, which are all methyl, this mirror plane would make positions 5 and 6 equivalent. Therefore, their protons would be a singlet. Wait, is that possible? Let me visualize. If the molecule has a mirror plane through the axis passing through positions 5 and 6, then swapping positions 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Since positions 1,2,3,4 all have methyl groups, swapping them would leave the molecule unchanged. Therefore, positions 5 and 6 are mirror images of each other and thus equivalent. Therefore, their protons would be a singlet. So 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet for aromatic protons. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought positions 5 and 6 were not equivalent, but maybe with this mirror plane, they are. Let me confirm. If there's a vertical mirror plane through positions 5 and 6, then positions 1 and 4 are mirrored, as are 2 and 3. Since all those positions have methyl groups, the mirror plane symmetry holds. Therefore, positions 5 and 6 are equivalent under this symmetry operation. Therefore, their protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet. Therefore, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet in the aromatic region. \n\nSimilarly, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene also has a singlet. Therefore, if the mixture contains these two compounds, each would contribute a singlet in the aromatic region, integrating to 2 protons each. Since the mixture is 1:1, the ratio of the integrals would be 1:1. That matches the problem statement. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption C is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Both would have singlets in the aromatic region. So that fits the aromatic signals part.\n\nNow, let's check the methyl signals. The problem states three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nFirst, let's analyze the methyl groups in each compound.\n\nFor 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. Let's see if they are equivalent. Positions 1 and 4 are para to each other, positions 2 and 5 are para. Are the methyl groups at 1 and 4 equivalent? Yes, due to the mirror plane. Similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent. Therefore, there are two sets of methyl groups: those at 1/4 and those at 2/5. Each set has two methyl groups. Therefore, the NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups, each integrating to 2 methyl groups (but since there are four methyl groups in total, two sets of two). However, wait, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, all methyl groups might not be equivalent. Let's see: positions 1 and 4 are para, positions 2 and 5 are para. Are the methyl groups at 1/4 different from those at 2/5? Let's consider the environment. Each methyl group is adjacent to two other methyl groups. For example, methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and methyl at 5 (since it's a benzene ring). Wait, no. In a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to two others. Position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Wait, no. Let me correct:\n\nIn benzene, each position is adjacent to its two immediate neighbors. So position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1.\n\nIn 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. So:\n\n- Methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n- Methyl at 2 is adjacent to methyl at 1 and methyl at 3 (but wait, position 3 is H, since substituents are at 1,2,4,5. Wait, no: substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So position 3 is H. Therefore, methyl at 2 is adjacent to methyl at 1 and H at 3.\n- Methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl at 5 and H at 3.\n- Methyl at 5 is adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's list the adjacent groups for each methyl:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 (position 2) and H at 6 (position 6).\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to methyl at 1 (position 1) and H at 3 (position 3).\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to methyl at 5 (position 5) and H at 3 (position 3).\n- Methyl at 5: adjacent to methyl at 4 (position 4) and H at 6 (position 6).\n\nSo methyl groups at 1 and 5: methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (6). Methyl at 5 is adjacent to methyl (4) and H (6). Are these environments equivalent? Not necessarily. Similarly, methyl at 2 and 4: methyl at 2 is adjacent to methyl (1) and H (3). Methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl (5) and H (3). Are these equivalent? If there's a mirror plane swapping positions 1 and 5, 2 and 4, then yes. Let's see: the molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. A mirror plane through positions 3 and 6 would swap positions 1 and 5, 2 and 4. Therefore, methyl at 1 and 5 would be equivalent, and methyl at 2 and 4 would be equivalent. Therefore, there are two sets of methyl groups: positions 1 and 5 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H), and positions 2 and 4 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H). Wait, but under the mirror plane, methyl 1 and 5 are swapped, as are 2 and 4. Therefore, the environments of methyl 1 and 5 are equivalent, and methyl 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, the NMR would show two singlets for the methyl groups: one for positions 1 and 5 (two methyl groups), and one for positions 2 and 4 (two methyl groups). So two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. But the problem states three signals at 2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio. Therefore, this compound alone would contribute two singlets. \n\nNow, the other compound in option C is 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its methyl groups. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. Each methyl group is adjacent to two other methyl groups? Let's see:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and methyl at 6 (but position 6 is H). Wait, no. Position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Since substituents are at 1,2,3,4:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to methyl at 1 and methyl at 3.\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to methyl at 2 and methyl at 4.\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5.\n\nSo each methyl group's environment:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl (2) and H (6).\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl (1) and methyl (3).\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl (2) and methyl (4).\n- Methyl 4: adjacent to methyl (3) and H (5).\n\nAre any of these equivalent? Let's check symmetry. The molecule has methyl groups at consecutive positions 1,2,3,4. This creates a structure where positions 1 and 4 are at the ends, and 2 and 3 are in the middle. \n\nIf there's a mirror plane through the center of the ring (between positions 3 and 4), swapping positions 1 and 4, 2 and 3. However, methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be swapped. Methyl at 1 (adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6) and methyl at 4 (adjacent to methyl 3 and H 5). If positions 5 and 6 are H, then under this mirror plane, methyl 1 and 4 are not equivalent because their adjacent groups differ. Methyl 1 is next to methyl 2 and H 6, methyl 4 is next to methyl 3 and H 5. Unless positions 5 and 6 are equivalent, which they aren't in this case. Therefore, methyl 1 and 4 are not equivalent. Similarly, methyl 2 and 3: methyl 2 is adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3, methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and methyl 4. These might be equivalent if there's a mirror plane swapping 2 and 3. But since the molecule is asymmetrical, probably not. Therefore, each methyl group is in a unique environment, leading to four signals. But wait, maybe some are equivalent. Let's see:\n\nMethyl 2 and methyl 3: methyl 2 is between methyl 1 and methyl 3, methyl 3 is between methyl 2 and methyl 4. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry swapping 2 and 3, but given the consecutive methyl groups, this seems unlikely. Therefore, methyl 2 and 3 are not equivalent. Similarly, methyl 1 and 4 are not equivalent. Therefore, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have four distinct methyl signals. But the problem states three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. Therefore, this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but maybe there is some equivalence. Let me think again. If the molecule has a mirror plane through position 2.5 and 5.5 (imaginary positions), swapping positions 1 and 4, 2 and 3. If this mirror plane exists, then methyl 1 and 4 would be equivalent, and methyl 2 and 3 would be equivalent. However, in reality, with four consecutive methyl groups, the molecule is likely to be asymmetrical. Therefore, methyl groups would have different environments. Therefore, four signals. But the problem has three signals. Therefore, option C can't be correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says three signals at 2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio. So total integration of 4 protons (2+1+1). Wait, methyl groups are -CH3, so each singlet corresponds to a certain number of methyl groups. For example, if one compound has two methyl groups in one environment, and the other compound has two methyl groups split into two environments, then total signals would be three. Let's see:\n\nIf one compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene) has two sets of methyl groups (two and two), contributing two singlets. The other compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene) has four methyl groups in four environments, but maybe some overlap. Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Let's try another approach.\n\nThe problem states that there are three singlets in the methyl region (around 2.2 ppm) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's assume that each singlet corresponds to a set of methyl groups. The total integration is 2+1+1=4, which corresponds to four methyl groups. Since each compound has four methyl groups (tetramethylbenzene) or two ethyl groups (diethylbenzene, which would have CH2CH3 groups, but ethyl groups would show up as quartets or something else, not singlets). Wait, the options include 1,4-diethylbenzene, which has two ethyl groups. Ethyl groups have CH2CH3. The CH2 groups would be split into quartets by the adjacent CH3, but the problem states that all the signals at 2.2 ppm are singlets. Therefore, the signals at 2.2 ppm must be from methyl groups (not ethyl), since ethyl groups would show up as multiplets. Therefore, the three signals at 2.2 ppm are from methyl groups, and the two compounds must be tetramethylbenzenes. Because diethylbenzene's ethyl groups would not contribute singlets at 2.2 ppm. Therefore, the mixture must be two tetramethylbenzenes. Therefore, options B, C, D are possible, and option A is out because it includes diethylbenzene.\n\nNow, focusing on options B, C, D. Each option has two tetramethylbenzenes. We need to determine which pair would give three methyl singlets in 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. As discussed earlier, methyl groups split into two sets: positions 1/5 and 2/4, each integrating to two methyl groups. So two singlets.\n\nSecond compound: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze its methyl groups. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. The methyl groups are at these positions. Each methyl's adjacent groups:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to methyl 4 (but position 4 is H) and H 6. Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Position 4 is H, position 6 is H. Wait, methyl at 5 is adjacent to H at 4 and H at 6? No, methyl at 5 is adjacent to position 4 (H) and position 6 (H). Wait, no: in benzene, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. If methyl is at 5, then it's adjacent to positions 4 and 6. But substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So methyl at 5 is adjacent to H at 4 and H at 6. Therefore, methyl at 5 is adjacent to two H's. Methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6. Methyl at 2 is adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3. Methyl at 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4. \n\nSo environments:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl and H.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to two methyls.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl and H.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to two H's.\n\nAre any of these equivalent? Let's check symmetry. The molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. Let's see if there's a mirror plane. If we have a mirror plane through methyl 5 and position 4, swapping positions 1 and 3. Methyl 1 and 3 would be mirrored. However, methyl 1 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6, methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4. If positions 4 and 6 are H, then methyl 1 and 3 are not equivalent. Therefore, methyl groups at 1,2,3,5 are all in different environments except possibly methyl 1 and 3. But as above, they are not equivalent. Methyl 5 is adjacent to two H's, unique environment. Therefore, this compound would have four methyl signals. But combined with the first compound's two signals, the total would be 2 + 4 = 6 signals, which contradicts the problem's three signals. Therefore, option B is out.\n\nOption C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst compound: two methyl signals.\n\nSecond compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. As discussed earlier, likely four methyl signals. Total signals: 2 + 4 = 6. Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nBoth compounds would have four methyl signals each. Total 8 signals. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, this is not working. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the ethyl groups in option A are not contributing. Let's reconsider option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nIf the ethyl groups in 1,4-diethylbenzene are contributing to the methyl signals. Wait, ethyl groups have CH2CH3. The CH3 groups would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. But the problem states that all the signals at 2.2 ppm are singlets. Therefore, ethyl groups' CH3 would not be singlets, so they must not be the source of these signals. Therefore, the three singlets at 2.2 ppm must be from the methyl groups of the tetramethylbenzenes. Therefore, the mixture must contain two tetramethylbenzenes whose methyl groups contribute three singlets in total.\n\nBut earlier analysis suggests that none of the options B, C, D give three signals. This is confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the methyl groups of the compounds.\n\nLet's take option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups: as discussed, four different environments? Or maybe some are equivalent. Let's try again.\n\nMethyl groups at 1,2,3,5.\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to H 4 and H 6.\n\nAre any of these equivalent? Let's check for symmetry. If there's a mirror plane through position 5 and the center of the ring, swapping positions 1 and 3, 2 and 6. But methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Swapping 1 and 3 would swap methyl 1 and 3. Methyl 1 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6; methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4. Unless positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, which they aren't, methyl 1 and 3 are not equivalent. Methyl 5 is adjacent to H 4 and H 6, unique. Methyl 2 is adjacent to two methyls. Therefore, four different environments. So four methyl signals. \n\n1,4-diethylbenzene's ethyl groups: the CH2CH3 groups. The CH2 would be a quartet and the CH3 a triplet, but these would appear in the NMR, but the problem states that the signals at 2.2 ppm are singlets. Therefore, ethyl groups are not contributing to these signals. Therefore, the three signals at 2.2 ppm must come from the tetramethylbenzene's methyl groups. But 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl signals, which combined with nothing from the diethylbenzene, would give four signals. Doesn't match the problem's three. Therefore, option A is out.\n\nThis suggests that none of the options are correct, which can't be. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go back to the original problem. The molecular formula is C10H14. For tetramethylbenzenes: C6H2(CH3)4 \u2192 C10H14. Correct. For 1,4-diethylbenzene: C6H4(CH2CH3)2 \u2192 C10H14. Correct.\n\nThe aromatic signals are two singlets in 1:1 ratio. So each compound must have one singlet. We determined that 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one singlet. Which other compound has one singlet?\n\nLooking at 1,4-diethylbenzene: earlier analysis suggested two signals, but maybe I was wrong. Let's think again. If the ethyl groups are para, the aromatic protons might be equivalent due to symmetry. Wait, no. The ethyl groups are at para positions, so the remaining protons are ortho and meta to the ethyl groups. Ortho protons are adjacent to ethyl, meta are next to ortho. But due to the para substitution, the ortho protons are equivalent, and the meta protons are equivalent. Therefore, two signals. But the problem has two singlets, which would require each compound to have one singlet. Therefore, 1,4-diethylbenzene cannot be the answer.\n\nWait, maybe another compound. Let's check 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene), but it's not in the options. The options only have tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene.\n\nWait, the problem says the mixture contains two aromatic compounds. The options are combinations of tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene. We need to find two compounds where each has one aromatic singlet.\n\nFrom earlier analysis:\n\n- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: one singlet (positions 3 and 6).\n- 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: if positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to symmetry, one singlet.\n- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: two signals.\n- 1,4-diethylbenzene: two signals.\n\nEarlier I thought that 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene might have a singlet if positions 5 and 6 are equivalent. Let's confirm this. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. Positions 5 and 6 remaining. If there's a mirror plane through positions 5 and 6, swapping 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Since all those positions have methyl groups, swapping them leaves the molecule unchanged. Therefore, positions 5 and 6 are mirror images and thus equivalent. Therefore, their protons are a singlet. Therefore, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have one aromatic singlet. \n\nSimilarly, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has one aromatic singlet. Therefore, option C (these two compounds) would have two singlets in the aromatic region, each from each compound. That fits the problem's aromatic signals.\n\nNow, the methyl signals. For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: methyl groups split into two sets (positions 1/5 and 2/4), two singlets.\n\nFor 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: methyl groups. Let's analyze again. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. Each methyl's adjacent groups:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl 2 and methyl 4.\n- Methyl 4: adjacent to methyl 3 and H 5.\n\nAre any of these equivalent? Due to the mirror plane through positions 5 and 6:\n\n- Methyl 1 and methyl 4: methyl 1 is adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6; methyl 4 is adjacent to methyl 3 and H 5. If positions 5 and 6 are equivalent due to the mirror plane, then H 5 and H 6 are equivalent. Therefore, methyl 1 and 4 are in equivalent environments (each adjacent to a methyl and an H). Similarly, methyl 2 and methyl 3: methyl 2 is adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3; methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and methyl 4. But under the mirror plane, methyl 2 and 3 are swapped. However, their environments are different: methyl 2 is adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3, methyl 3 is adjacent to methyl 2 and methyl 4. If methyl 1 and 4 are equivalent, then methyl 2 and 3 might also be equivalent. Let's see:\n\nIf methyl 1 and 4 are equivalent, and methyl 2 and 3 are equivalent, then the methyl groups would be in two sets: methyl 1/4 and methyl 2/3. Each set has two methyl groups. Therefore, two singlets. \n\nTherefore, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have two methyl singlets. \n\nTherefore, option C's two compounds would contribute 2 (from first compound) + 2 (from second compound) = 4 methyl signals. But the problem states three signals. Contradiction. \n\nWait, but maybe there's overlap between the methyl signals of the two compounds. For example, if one singlet from the first compound coincides with a singlet from the second compound. \n\nFor example, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl singlets (say A and B), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl singlets (say C and D). If one of A or B coincides with C or D, then total signals would be three. \n\nSuppose in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at positions 1/5 and 2/4 have different chemical shifts. In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at 1/4 and 2/3. If the chemical shift of methyl 1/5 in the first compound is the same as methyl 1/4 in the second compound, then they would overlap, contributing to one signal. Similarly, other overlaps might occur. \n\nBut this requires specific knowledge of the chemical shifts, which is beyond the scope of this analysis. However, the problem states that the three methyl signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let's assume that one of the compounds contributes two methyl groups (integral 2) and the other contributes two methyl groups split into two integrals of 1 each. \n\nFor example, if 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene contributes two methyl singlets (each integrating to 2), and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene contributes two methyl singlets (each integrating to 2), but if one of the singlets overlaps, the total would be three signals: 2+2, 2, 2 \u2192 but integrals would be 4, 2, 2, which doesn't match the problem's 2:1:1. \n\nAlternatively, if one compound contributes two methyl groups (integral 2) and the other contributes two sets of methyl groups (integral 1 each), then total integrals would be 2,1,1. For example, if 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl groups in one environment (integral 2) and the other compound has two methyl groups split into two environments (1 each). But how?\n\nWait, maybe 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has two methyl groups (positions 1/5) integrating to 2, and two methyl groups (positions 2/4) integrating to 2. The other compound, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, has two methyl groups (positions 1/4) integrating to 2, and two methyl groups (positions 2/3) integrating to 2. If one of the signals overlaps (say positions 1/5 from the first compound and positions 1/4 from the second compound have the same shift), then the total integrals would be 2+2=4, and the other two signals would be 2 each. But the problem states 2:1:1. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to consider that one of the compounds has three distinct methyl environments and the other has one, but that doesn't fit the options.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the answer choices again. The correct answer is likely option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Even though earlier analysis suggested issues, perhaps I missed something.\n\nIf the mixture contains 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:\n\n- Aromatic signals: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has two aromatic protons (positions 4 and 6), which might be equivalent due to symmetry. Wait, earlier analysis said they might not be, but maybe they are. If positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, then it would be a singlet. Similarly, 1,4-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons: if they are equivalent due to some symmetry, leading to a singlet. But earlier analysis suggested two signals. However, maybe in reality, para-diethylbenzene's aromatic protons are accidentally equivalent, leading to a singlet. For example, if the ethyl groups cause such a strong shielding that all aromatic protons have the same shift. Unlikely, but possible. If that's the case, then each compound contributes one singlet, totaling two, matching the problem.\n\nFor the methyl signals: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups. If they split into three environments: maybe two methyl groups in one environment, and one each in two others. For example, methyl groups at positions 1 and 5 (each adjacent to a methyl and a H), methyl groups at 2 and 3 (each adjacent to two methyls), but wait:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 6.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to methyl 1 and methyl 3.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to methyl 2 and H 4.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to H 4 and H 6.\n\nSo environments:\n\n- Methyl 1: adjacent to one methyl and one H.\n- Methyl 2: adjacent to two methyls.\n- Methyl 3: adjacent to one methyl and one H.\n- Methyl 5: adjacent to two H's.\n\nSo four different environments. Therefore, four signals. But the problem has three signals. Therefore, this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the problem's methyl signals are at 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in 2:1:1 ratio. The total integration is 4, which corresponds to four methyl groups. Since each tetramethylbenzene has four methyl groups, and the mixture is 1:1, the total methyl groups would be eight. But the problem's integration sums to four, which suggests that only four methyl groups are contributing. This implies that one of the compounds is not a tetramethylbenzene but has fewer methyl groups. However, all options except A involve two tetramethylbenzenes. Option A has one tetramethylbenzene and one diethylbenzene. Diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups (CH2CH3), which contribute to the NMR but not as singlets. Therefore, the four methyl groups from the tetramethylbenzene would be the ones contributing to the methyl signals. If the tetramethylbenzene in option A (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene) has four methyl groups split into three signals (2:1:1), that would fit. For example, two methyl groups in one environment, and one each in two others. Let's see:\n\nIf methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are equivalent (integral 2), and methyl groups at 2 and 5 are unique (integral 1 each). But earlier analysis suggested four environments. However, maybe due to symmetry, methyl 1 and 3 are equivalent. Let's check:\n\nIf there's a mirror plane swapping positions 1 and 3, 2 and 5. If such a mirror plane exists, then methyl 1 and 3 would be equivalent, and methyl 2 and 5 would be equivalent. But methyl 2 is adjacent to two methyls, methyl 5 is adjacent to two H's. Therefore, they can't be equivalent. Therefore, methyl 1 and 3 are not equivalent. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the analysis, I think the correct answer is option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Even though earlier analysis suggested issues, perhaps the aromatic protons of 1,4-diethylbenzene are a singlet due to rapid rotation or accidental equivalence, and the methyl groups of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene split into three signals (2:1:1). However, this is speculative. Alternatively, the correct answer is option C, but I can't reconcile the methyl signals. Given the problem's information, the most plausible answer is A.",
