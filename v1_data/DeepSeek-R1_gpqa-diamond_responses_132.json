        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution. Let me start by understanding the problem. We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm\u00b3, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH\u2082PO\u2084 and 1.00 g of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) at 25\u00b0C. The given Ka values for H\u2083PO\u2084 are Ka1 = 7.5\u00d710\u207b\u00b3, Ka2 = 6.2\u00d710\u207b\u2078, and Ka3 = 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that orthophosphate ions (PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b) come from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid (H\u2083PO\u2084). However, in solution, the phosphate ions can exist in different protonation states depending on the pH. Since we're dealing with salts of the conjugate bases here\u2014KH\u2082PO\u2084 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate (which is H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b) and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O is disodium hydrogen phosphate (which is HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b)\u2014the pH of the solution will determine the speciation of the phosphate ions.\n\nBut wait, the problem is specifically asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. Given that Ka3 is 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2, which is very small, the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b is likely going to be very low. However, since we have both H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b in solution, maybe the pH is such that some of the HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b will deprotonate to form PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. Alternatively, maybe the solution's pH is around the pKa2 or pKa3, so we need to calculate the pH first?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the buffer solution formed by mixing H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b. Since KH\u2082PO\u2084 provides H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O provides HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, this is a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation based on the relevant pKa. But which pKa is relevant here?\n\nH\u2083PO\u2084 can lose three protons:\n\n1. H\u2083PO\u2084 \u21cc H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b + H\u207a (Ka1)\n2. H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b \u21cc HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b + H\u207a (Ka2)\n3. HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u21cc PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a (Ka3)\n\nSo, the H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is the conjugate base of the first dissociation, and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is the conjugate base of the second dissociation. Therefore, when we have a solution containing both H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, the pH will be determined by the second dissociation, i.e., Ka2. Therefore, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would use pKa2.\n\nSo, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]/[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b])\n\nOnce we have the pH, we can then use Ka3 to find the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b from HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b.\n\nBut first, let's calculate the concentrations of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b in the solution.\n\nFirst, calculate moles of KH\u2082PO\u2084:\n\nMolar mass of KH\u2082PO\u2084 is 136.09 g/mol. So, moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol \u2248 0.00735 mol.\n\nSimilarly, moles of Na\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol \u2248 0.00562 mol.\n\nTotal volume is 0.2 L. Therefore, concentrations:\n\n[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b] = 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M\n\n[HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] = 0.00562 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0281 M\n\nNow, using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is the acid and HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is the conjugate base):\n\npH = pKa2 + log([HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]/[H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b])\n\npKa2 = -log(6.2\u00d710\u207b\u2078) \u2248 7.21\n\nSo, pH = 7.21 + log(0.0281 / 0.03675)\n\nCalculate the ratio: 0.0281 / 0.03675 \u2248 0.765\n\nlog(0.765) \u2248 -0.116\n\nTherefore, pH \u2248 7.21 - 0.116 \u2248 7.094 \u2248 7.09\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is approximately 7.09.\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b. Since HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b can donate another proton to become PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b, governed by Ka3:\n\nHPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b \u21cc PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b + H\u207a\n\nKa3 = [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b][H\u207a] / [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b]\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for [PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b]:\n\n[PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] = Ka3 * [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] / [H\u207a]\n\nWe know Ka3 = 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2, [HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b] is 0.0281 M, and [H\u207a] can be calculated from the pH.\n\npH is 7.09, so [H\u207a] = 10^(-7.09) \u2248 8.13\u00d710\u207b\u2078 M\n\nTherefore,\n\n[PO\u2084\u00b3\u207b] = (1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2) * 0.0281 / (8.13\u00d710\u207b\u2078)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply numerator: 1.8\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 * 0.0281 \u2248 1.8\u00d70.0281 \u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 \u2248 0.05058 \u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 = 5.058\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2074\n\nThen divide by 8.13\u00d710\u207b\u2078:\n\n5.058\u00d710\u207b\u00b9\u2074 / 8.13\u00d710\u207b\u2078 \u2248 (5.058 / 8.13) \u00d710\u207b\u2076 \u2248 0.622 \u00d710\u207b\u2076 \u2248 6.22\u00d710\u207b\u2077 M\n\nHmm, that's approximately 6.22\u00d710\u207b\u2077 M, which is closest to option A: 6.24\u00d710\u207b\u2077 M. However, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, check moles:\n\nKH\u2082PO\u2084: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 0.00735 mol. Correct.\n\nNa\u2082HPO\u2084\u00b72H\u2082O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol = approx 0.00562 mol. Correct.\n\nConcentrations:\n\n0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M\n\n0.00562 / 0.2 = 0.0281 M. Correct.\n\npH calculation:\n\npKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) \u2248 7.21. Correct.\n\nlog(0.0281 / 0.03675) = log(0.765) \u2248 -0.116. So pH \u22487.09. Correct.\n\n[H+] = 10^-7.09 \u2248 8.13e-8. Correct.\n\nKa3 * [HPO4^2-] / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.0281) / 8.13e-8\n\nCompute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.0281 = 1.8*0.0281 = 0.05058, so 5.058e-14\n\nDivide by 8.13e-8: 5.058e-14 /8.13e-8 = (5.058 /8.13) *1e-6 \u2248 0.622 *1e-6 =6.22e-7 M\n\nSo approx 6.22e-7 M. The answer option A is 6.24e-7 M. That's very close. Maybe due to more precise calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I approximated pKa2 too much. Let me recalculate pKa2 more accurately.\n\nKa2 =6.2e-8, so pKa2= -log(6.2e-8). Let's compute log(6.2e-8):\n\nlog(6.2) = approx 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8)=0.7924 -8= -7.2076, so pKa2=7.2076\u22487.21. So that's accurate.\n\nThen pH=7.2076 + log(0.0281/0.03675). Let's compute log(0.765):\n\nlog(0.765)= log(7.65*10^-1)=log(7.65) -1. log(7.65)=0.8837 (since log7=0.8451, log7.6=0.8808, log7.65=0.8837). So log(0.765)=0.8837 -1= -0.1163.\n\nThus pH=7.2076 -0.1163=7.0913\u22487.09. So [H+]=10^-7.0913=10^(-7 -0.0913)=10^-7 *10^-0.0913\u22481e-7 *0.81. Let's compute 10^-0.0913:\n\n10^-0.0913=antilog(-0.0913)= approx 0.81? Let's check:\n\nln(0.81)= -0.2107, so log(0.81)= ln(0.81)/ln(10)= -0.2107/2.3026\u2248-0.0915. So yes, 10^-0.0915\u22480.81. Therefore, [H+]\u22480.81e-7=8.1e-8 M. Correct.\n\nThen [PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 *0.0281)/8.1e-8= (1.8*0.0281)/8.1 *1e-12/1e-8= (0.05058)/8.1 *1e-4\u22480.006244 *1e-4=6.244e-7 M. So approx 6.24e-7 M, which matches option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way this could be approached. For example, considering that the phosphate species are in a buffer solution, and the concentration of PO4^3- is determined by the equilibrium from HPO4^2-.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps activity coefficients or ionic strength effects are considered, but given that the problem doesn't mention activity coefficients and the options are all around 1e-7, which is very low, maybe those effects are negligible here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the pH is solely determined by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- buffer. Let me confirm.\n\nThe solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, the relevant species in solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.\n\nThese two species form a buffer, and the pH is determined by their ratio via the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Since H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- can act as a base (accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-), the pH should indeed be around pKa2. Therefore, the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct, leading to answer A. However, let me check the answer options again:\n\nA. 6.24x10^-7 M\n\nB. 5.48x10^-7 M\n\nC. 2.81x10^-7 M\n\nD. 3.97x10^-7 M\n\nSo, A is the closest. But wait, in my calculation, I used [HPO4^2-] =0.0281 M. However, Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O is a hydrated salt. Does the water of crystallization affect the molar mass? Yes, the molar mass given is 177.99 g/mol, which already includes the 2 H2O molecules. So when we dissolved 1.00 g of Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O, we are getting 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol =0.00562 mol of HPO4^2- ions. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct, and the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when calculating [PO4^3-], we assumed that all the HPO4^2- is available to deprotonate. However, in reality, the buffer system is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the concentration of HPO4^2- is fixed by the buffer. But since the pH is known, and the [H+] is known, the calculation of [PO4^3-] via Ka3 is appropriate. Therefore, the answer should indeed be A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the phosphate species, but given that PO4^3- is so minuscule compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-, the approximation holds.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
