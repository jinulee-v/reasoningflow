Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes?\nA. 1.2\nB. 3\nC. 2.4\nD. 1.9",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift of these neutral hydrogen clouds so that the Lyman alpha absorption at around 1216 Angstroms can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, let's start by recalling what redshift means. Redshift (z) is how much the wavelength of light has stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. \n\nThe problem says the Lyman alpha absorption is at rest wavelength 1216 Angstroms. Optical telescopes on the ground can detect light in the visible spectrum, which is roughly from about 3000 Angstroms (ultraviolet) to 7000 Angstroms (near-infrared). Wait, but actually, ground-based optical telescopes can't observe much below the near-ultraviolet because the Earth's atmosphere absorbs a lot of that. So the atmosphere is opaque to certain wavelengths, right? The atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms, meaning that light with wavelengths shorter than that doesn't reach the ground; it's absorbed by the atmosphere. So for ground-based optical telescopes, the practical lower limit is about 3000 Angstroms.\n\nTherefore, we need the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption to be at least 3000 Angstroms to be detectable. Using the redshift formula: observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z). So we set 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) \u2265 3000 Angstroms. Solving for z: (1 + z) \u2265 3000 / 1216. Let me calculate that. 3000 divided by 1216 is approximately 2.467. So z \u2265 2.467 - 1 = 1.467. Wait, but the answer choices are 1.2, 3, 2.4, 1.9. Hmm, 1.467 isn't one of the options. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the atmospheric cutoff. Let me check again. The optical window for ground-based telescopes is typically considered from about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) to 1000 nm (10,000 Angstroms). So yes, anything below 3000 Angstroms (UV) is blocked. Therefore, the observed wavelength needs to be redshifted into the optical range, i.e., at least 3000 Angstroms. So rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. So solving for z:\n\n(1 + z) = observed wavelength / rest wavelength = 3000 / 1216 \u2248 2.467\n\nTherefore, z \u2248 1.467. But the options given are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3. The closest one is 1.9 (option D). Wait, but 1.467 is lower than 1.9. So why is 1.9 the answer? Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the atmospheric cutoff is higher? Maybe I should use 4000 Angstroms instead? Wait, no. 4000 Angstroms is blue light, which is still in the optical range. The atmospheric cutoff is around 3000 Angstroms. Let me confirm. For example, the ozone layer absorbs UV light below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). So ground-based telescopes can't see below that. So if the observed wavelength is 3000 Angstroms, then z = (3000 / 1216) - 1 \u2248 1.467. But none of the answer choices match that. The options are A. 1.2, B. 3, C. 2.4, D. 1.9.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the actual Lyman alpha line being observed in the optical range. Let's think again. The Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet. To be observed in optical, the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range. Let's say the optical range starts at 3600 Angstroms (near-ultraviolet) to 7000 Angstroms. But maybe the problem is considering the visible range starting at around 4000 Angstroms (violet) to 7000 Angstroms (red). If the question is about detection with optical telescopes, which typically cover approximately 4000-7000 Angstroms. So maybe the lower limit is 4000 Angstroms. Let's recalculate with 4000 Angstroms.\n\nSo observed wavelength = 4000 Angstroms. Then z = (4000 / 1216) - 1 \u2248 3.289 - 1 \u2248 2.289. So z \u2248 2.29. The closest answer is C. 2.4. But 2.29 is less than 2.4. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the upper limit? Wait, the problem says \"lower limit on the redshift\", so the minimum z needed to shift 1216 Angstroms into the optical range. If the optical range starts at 3000 Angstroms, then z \u2248 1.467. If it starts at 4000 Angstroms, z \u2248 2.29. But neither of these numbers exactly match the answer choices. The options given are 1.2, 3, 2.4, 1.9.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is between the Lyman alpha emission and absorption. The problem states that the clouds absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength. So quasars emit light, which passes through the hydrogen cloud, and the cloud absorbs the Lyman alpha wavelength. So the absorption line is at the rest frame of the cloud. Wait, but if the cloud is at redshift z, then the absorption line would be observed at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. So to detect this absorption with a ground-based optical telescope, the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range. So same as before. So if the cloud is at redshift z, the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z). So to have that wavelength be above the atmospheric cutoff, say 3000 Angstroms, then (1+z) >= 3000/1216 \u2248 2.467, so z >= 1.467. But 1.467 is not an answer option. The next higher option is D. 1.9. Wait, but 1.9 would give 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9\u22483526 Angstroms, which is above 3000. So maybe the answer is D. 1.9. But why isn't 1.467 acceptable? Because maybe the optical telescopes can't detect 3000 Angstroms? Wait, 3000 Angstroms is 300 nm, which is in the ultraviolet. So perhaps the optical range is considered to start at longer wavelengths. Let me check.\n\nHuman eye can see from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So optical telescopes typically cover this range. However, CCDs in telescopes can sometimes go a bit into the near UV (down to ~300 nm) and near infrared. But atmospheric transmission is a key factor. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque below about 300 nm due to ozone. So ground-based telescopes can observe from roughly 300 nm to 1100 nm. So 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) is the lower limit. Therefore, if the observed wavelength is 3000 Angstroms, that's the lower limit. So z = (3000 / 1216) -1 \u22481.467. But since 1.467 isn't an option, maybe the answer expects the optical range to start at higher wavelengths. For example, if we take 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) as the lower limit, which is violet light, then z=(4000/1216)-1\u22482.29. Still, the closest answer is C. 2.4. But 2.29 is less than 2.4. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the Balmer break or something else? Wait, no. The question is straightforward: redshift the Lyman alpha wavelength into the optical range. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is D. 1.9. Let me check what wavelength that corresponds to. 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9\u22483526 Angstroms. 3526 Angstroms is 352.6 nm, which is still in the ultraviolet. Wait, but 350 nm is below 400 nm (violet). So 352.6 nm is still UV. So even with z=1.9, the observed wavelength is still in the UV, which is blocked by the atmosphere. Therefore, that wouldn't be detectable. So maybe I need to shift it into the visible range, starting at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Then z=(4000/1216)-1\u22482.29. So the lower limit would be approximately 2.3. The closest answer is C. 2.4. But 2.4 would give 1216*(1+2.4)=1216*3.4\u22484134 Angstroms, which is 413.4 nm, which is in the visible violet. So if the lower limit is 4000 Angstroms, then z\u22482.29 is the minimum, but since 2.4 is the next option, maybe that's the answer. But why isn't 1.9 sufficient? Because at z=1.9, the observed wavelength is ~3526 Angstroms, which is still UV and blocked. So to get into the visible, you need at least 4000 Angstroms, which requires z\u22482.29. Since 2.4 is the closest option, maybe answer C. 2.4. But the given options include D. 1.9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the atmospheric cutoff as 3200 Angstroms? Let's try that. Then z=(3200/1216)-1\u22482.63-1=1.63. Still not matching the options. Alternatively, maybe the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. Wait, yes, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So shifting that to 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) would require z=(3000/1216)-1\u22481.467. But again, not an option. \n\nWait, maybe the confusion is between emission and absorption. If the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption would be at a lower redshift. Wait, no. The problem states that the clouds are in deep space and absorb the light from background quasars. So the quasars are behind the clouds. Therefore, the clouds are at a lower redshift than the quasars. Wait, but the question is about the redshift of the clouds themselves. The absorption happens at the cloud's redshift. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z_cloud). We need this to be in the optical range as observed from Earth. Therefore, the cloud's redshift must be such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) \u2265 atmospheric cutoff (say 3000 Angstroms). Therefore, z_cloud \u2265 (3000/1216) -1 \u22481.467. So the lower limit is approximately 1.47. But the options given are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3. The closest one is D. 1.9. But 1.47 is less than 1.9. So why is 1.9 the answer? Maybe the atmospheric cutoff is higher? If the cutoff is 3500 Angstroms, then z=(3500/1216)-1\u22482.88-1=1.88\u22481.9. Ah! So if the atmospheric cutoff is around 3500 Angstroms (350 nm), which is still in the ultraviolet, but maybe some telescopes can observe down to 350 nm? Wait, 350 nm is still considered UV, but some optical telescopes might have sensitivity into the near UV. For example, the Hubble Space Telescope can observe UV, but ground-based telescopes are limited by the atmosphere. The atmospheric transmission drops significantly below 320 nm. So perhaps the practical cutoff is around 3200 Angstroms (320 nm). Let's calculate z for 3200 Angstroms: (3200/1216)-1\u22482.63-1=1.63. Still not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the Lyman alpha forest, which are absorption lines from neutral hydrogen clouds at various redshifts. But the principle remains the same. The key point is that the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. If the lower limit of the optical range is taken as 3600 Angstroms (360 nm), which is near-UV but sometimes considered part of the optical for some telescopes, then z=(3600/1216)-1\u22482.96-1=1.96\u22482.0. The closest option is D. 1.9. So maybe the answer is D. 1.9. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem assumes that optical telescopes can only observe above 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), which is violet. Then z=(4000/1216)-1\u22483.29-1=2.29. The closest answer is C. 2.4. But since 2.29 is less than 2.4, maybe the answer expects rounding up. However, given the options, D. 1.9 and C. 2.4 are both close. \n\nWait, let's check the actual typical values. In astronomy, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra at redshifts z > 2, because at lower redshifts, the Lyman-alpha line (1216 Angstroms) is redshifted into the optical. For example, at z=2, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+2)=3648 Angstroms, which is 364.8 nm. This is still in the ultraviolet, but some optical instruments can observe down to ~300 nm. However, in practice, the Lyman-alpha forest is observable from the ground for quasars at z > 1.7, because then the Lyman-alpha line is redshifted above 3000 Angstroms (300 nm). Wait, but 1216*(1+1.7)=1216*2.7=3283 Angstroms, which is 328.3 nm. Still UV. But maybe ground-based telescopes can observe up to that if their instruments are sensitive enough? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplified and uses 4000 Angstroms as the lower limit for optical. Then z=(4000/1216)-1\u22482.29. The closest answer is D. 1.9 or C. 2.4. If the options are A.1.2, B.3, C.2.4, D.1.9. Then 2.4 is higher than 2.29, so it's a safe lower limit. Wait, but the question asks for the lower limit, meaning the minimum redshift needed. So if 2.29 is the exact value, then the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so the answer should be the smallest z that is greater than 2.29, which is 2.4 (option C). But if the calculation gives 2.29, and 2.4 is the next option, then 2.4 is the lower limit? Wait, no. The lower limit is the minimum z required. If z=2.29 is enough, then any z higher than that is also acceptable. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so the answer should be the option that is the smallest z greater than 2.29, which is 2.4 (option C). However, if the options are not exact, maybe the problem expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different atmospheric cutoff. For example, if the cutoff is 912 Angstroms (Lyman limit), but that's not relevant here. Or maybe considering the Balmer series? No, the question is about Lyman alpha.\n\nWait, another angle: the problem says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes\". So the lower limit is the minimum redshift needed so that the absorption line is shifted into the optical range. If the optical range starts at 3000 Angstroms, then z\u22481.47. But none of the options is close to that. If it starts at 4000 Angstroms, z\u22482.29. The options given are 1.2, 3, 2.4, 1.9. So between 1.9 and 2.4. If the calculation is 2.29, then 2.4 is the next option. But maybe the problem considers that the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, and optical is considered starting at 380 nm (near UV), which some telescopes can observe. Let's try 3800 Angstroms: z=(3800/1216)-1\u22483.125-1=2.125. Still closest to 2.4 or 1.9? 2.125 is closer to 2.4 than 1.9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original question assumes that optical telescopes can only observe above 5000 Angstroms (green light)? Then z=(5000/1216)-1\u22484.11-1=3.11. Then the answer would be B.3. But that seems too high.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall that the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). To observe this in the optical, say at 500 nm (5000 Angstroms), z=(5000/1216)-1\u22484.11-1=3.11. But option B is 3. So maybe that's the answer? But that seems too high. Typically, Lyman-alpha forest is observed starting around z=2. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused because different sources might have different conventions. Let me check some astronomy references. For example, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra when the quasar's redshift is high enough that the Lyman-alpha emission line is redshifted into the optical. But the absorption lines from intervening clouds at lower redshifts will have their Lyman-alpha absorption lines at longer wavelengths. Wait, no. If a cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. So to observe that absorption in the optical (say > 3000 Angstroms), z must be such that 1216*(1+z) >= 3000. So z >= (3000/1216)-1\u22481.467. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately 1.47. But the options don't have that. The closest is D.1.9. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, so that the cloud's Lyman-alpha absorption is in the quasar's rest frame. Wait, no. The cloud's redshift determines the observed wavelength of the absorption. The quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's, but the absorption line is at the cloud's redshift. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the lower limit of the quasar's redshift, not the cloud's. Wait, the question says: \"estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes\". The objects here are the clouds. So the clouds need to have sufficient redshift so that their Lyman-alpha absorption is in the optical. Therefore, as before, z >= ~1.47. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is D.1.9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the Lyman-alpha line is actually observed in the quasar's rest frame. Wait, no. The absorption is due to the cloud, so the absorption line is at the cloud's redshift. The quasar's light is background, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Therefore, the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). Therefore, to observe this in optical, z_cloud must be such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) is in the optical range. \n\nGiven that the options are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3, and the calculation gives ~1.47, which is not an option, but 1.9 is the next higher option. However, 1.9 gives 1216*2.9\u22483526 Angstroms, which is still UV. So unless the problem is considering a higher atmospheric cutoff, maybe 4000 Angstroms. Then z=2.29, closest is 2.4. But 2.4 gives 1216*3.4\u22484134 Angstroms, which is in the visible. So maybe the answer is C.2.4. \n\nBut why is there such a discrepancy? Maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes\". The lower limit is the minimum redshift needed to shift the Lyman-alpha absorption into the optical range. If the optical range starts at 3000 Angstroms, z\u22481.47. If it starts at 4000 Angstroms, z\u22482.29. The answer options are 1.2, 3, 2.4, 1.9. Since 1.47 isn't an option, and 1.9 is higher than 1.47, maybe the intended answer is D.1.9. But that would imply that the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+1.9)=3526 Angstroms, which is still UV. Unless the problem considers 3500 Angstroms as optical. But typically, optical is considered to start at 4000 Angstroms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using the Balmer series or another line. Wait, no. The question specifically mentions Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the redshift of the quasar, not the cloud. If the quasar is at redshift z_qso, then the Lyman-alpha emission line from the quasar is at 1216*(1+z_qso). If there are intervening clouds at lower redshifts, their Lyman-alpha absorption would be at 1216*(1+z_cloud). But to detect the absorption, the quasar's light must be bright enough, and the absorption line must be in the observable range. However, the question specifically mentions the clouds' redshift. \n\nGiven the options, and the calculations, the most plausible answer is D.1.9, even though strictly speaking, the calculation gives ~1.47. Maybe the problem assumes that optical observations start at 3500 Angstroms, leading to z\u22481.88\u22481.9. Therefore, the answer is D.1.9.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}"

Let me check what wavelength that corresponds to. 1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9\u22483526 Angstroms. 3526 Angstroms is 352.6 nm, which is still in the ultraviolet. Wait, but 350 nm is below 400 nm (violet). So 352.6 nm is still UV. So even with z=1.9, the observed wavelength is still in the UV, which is blocked by the atmosphere. Therefore, that wouldn't be detectable. So maybe I need to shift it into the visible range, starting at 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Then z=(4000/1216)-1\u22482.29. So the lower limit would be approximately 2.3. The closest answer is C. 2.4.

But maybe the problem considers that the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, and optical is considered starting at 380 nm (near UV), which some telescopes can observe. Let's try 3800 Angstroms: z=(3800/1216)-1\u22483.125-1=2.125. Still closest to 2.4 or 1.9? 2.125 is closer to 2.4 than 1.9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original question assumes that optical telescopes can only observe above 5000 Angstroms (green light)? Then z=(5000/1216)-1\u22484.11-1=3.11. Then the answer would be B.3. But that seems too high.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall that the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). To observe this in the optical, say at 500 nm (5000 Angstroms), z=(5000/1216)-1\u22484.11-1=3.11. But option B is 3. So maybe that's the answer? But that seems too high. Typically, Lyman-alpha forest is observed starting around z=2. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused because different sources might have different conventions. Let me check some astronomy references. For example, the Lyman-alpha forest is observed in quasar spectra when the quasar's redshift is high enough that the Lyman-alpha emission line is redshifted into the optical. But the absorption lines from intervening clouds at lower redshifts will have their Lyman-alpha absorption lines at longer wavelengths. Wait, no. If a cloud is at redshift z, then the Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. So to observe that absorption in the optical (say > 3000 Angstroms), z must be such that 1216*(1+z) >= 3000. So z >= (3000/1216)-1\u22481.467. Therefore, the lower limit is approximately 1.47. But the options don't have that. The closest is D.1.9. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the cloud, so that the cloud's Lyman-alpha absorption is in the quasar's rest frame. Wait, no. The cloud's redshift determines the observed wavelength of the absorption. The quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's, but the absorption line is at the cloud's redshift. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the lower limit of the quasar's redshift, not the cloud's. Wait, the question says: \"estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes\". The objects here are the clouds. So the clouds need to have sufficient redshift so that their Lyman-alpha absorption is in the optical. Therefore, as before, z >= ~1.47. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is D.1.9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the Lyman-alpha line is actually observed in the quasar's rest frame. Wait, no. The absorption is due to the cloud, so the absorption line is at the cloud's redshift. The quasar's light is background, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Therefore, the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud). Therefore, to observe this in optical, z_cloud must be such that 1216*(1+z_cloud) is in the optical range. \n\nGiven that the options are 1.2, 1.9, 2.4, 3, and the calculation gives ~1.47, which is not an option, but 1.9 is the next higher option. However, 1.9 gives 1216*2.9\u22483526 Angstroms, which is still UV. So unless the problem is considering a higher atmospheric cutoff, maybe 4000 Angstroms. Then z=2.29, closest is 2.4. But 2.4 gives 1216*3.4\u22484134 Angstroms, which is in the visible. So maybe the answer is C.2.4. \n\nBut why is there such a discrepancy? Maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says \"lower limit on the redshift of this objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes\". The lower limit is the minimum redshift needed to shift the Lyman-alpha absorption into the optical range. If the optical range starts at 3000 Angstroms, z\u22481.47. If it starts at 4000 Angstroms, z\u22482.29. ",
