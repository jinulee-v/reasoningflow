        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the transformations step-by-step and understand the structure of each intermediate product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of Product 1\nThe starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When it is heated with KOH, the bromine atoms are replaced by hydroxyl groups due to the strong basic conditions, leading to the formation of 1,3-dihydroxyadamantane. The presence of a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1 in the IR spectrum suggests that one of the hydroxyl groups has been oxidized to a carbonyl group, resulting in 1-hydroxy-3-adamantanone.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of Product 2\nProduct 1 (1-hydroxy-3-adamantanone) is then treated with aluminum isopropoxide. This reagent can act as a base and also promote dehydration reactions. In this case, it likely leads to the elimination of water from the hydroxyl group, forming an enol or ketone. Given the context, it's more plausible that the hydroxyl group is eliminated, leading to the formation of 3-adamantanone.\n\n### Step 3: Formation of Product 3\nProduct 2 (3-adamantanone) is subjected to ozonolysis at -78\u00b0C, which cleaves the carbon-carbon double bond (if any) and introduces carbonyl groups. However, since adamantane does not have a double bond, ozonolysis would primarily affect the carbonyl group, leading to its cleavage and potentially forming two aldehyde groups. The subsequent addition of dimethylsulfide (DMS) reduces these aldehydes to methylene groups, resulting in a compound with two methylene groups attached to the adamantane core.\n\n### Analyzing the NMR Spectrum of Product 3\nGiven the structure of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen atoms are those attached to the methylene groups formed after ozonolysis and reduction. These hydrogens are typically coupled to multiple neighboring protons, leading to complex splitting patterns.\n\nIn the case of adamantane, the methylene groups are part of a highly symmetric structure where each proton is coupled to several equivalent protons. The most deshielded hydrogen atoms would be those directly attached to the methylene groups, which are coupled to three equivalent protons on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**C. triplet of triplets**"
