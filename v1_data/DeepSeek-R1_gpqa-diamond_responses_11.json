        "question": "Find KE of product particles in,\nPi(+) = mu(+) + nu\nhere Pi(+) is stationary.\nRest mass of Pi(+) &  mu(+) is 139.6 MeV & 105.7 MeV respectively.\nA. 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\nB. 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\nC. 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\nD. 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles when a positively charged pion (Pi+) decays into a positively charged muon (mu+) and a neutrino (nu). The pion is initially stationary, so its entire energy is just its rest mass energy. The rest masses are given: 139.6 MeV for the pion and 105.7 MeV for the muon. The answer choices are A through D, each giving two values, presumably the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino, respectively. \n\nFirst, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and neutrino after the decay must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That way, their vector sum is zero, satisfying conservation of momentum.\n\nLet me denote the muon as \u03bc+ and the neutrino as \u03bd. The pion (\u03c0+) is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After the decay, the total energy should still be 139.6 MeV, but now distributed between the muon and neutrino. The muon has rest mass energy 105.7 MeV, so its total energy will be its rest mass plus kinetic energy. The neutrino, being a very light particle, can be considered massless for this problem, so its energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light (which in natural units where c=1, is just its momentum). \n\nSo, let's write down the conservation equations. \n\nFirst, conservation of energy:\n\nE_\u03c0 = E_\u03bc + E_\u03bd\n\n139.6 MeV = (m_\u03bc c\u00b2 + K_\u03bc) + E_\u03bd\n\nAssuming c=1 in these units, so:\n\n139.6 = 105.7 + K_\u03bc + E_\u03bd\n\nTherefore, K_\u03bc + E_\u03bd = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. So the sum of the muon's kinetic energy and the neutrino's energy is 33.9 MeV. But we need to find each individually. \n\nNext, conservation of momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momentum of the muon must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the momentum of the neutrino. So:\n\n|p_\u03bc| = |p_\u03bd|\n\nBut the muon's momentum can be related to its kinetic energy. For a relativistic particle, the total energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ). Again, using c=1 units, E_\u03bc = sqrt( p_\u03bc\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2 ). Since E_\u03bc = m_\u03bc + K_\u03bc, we can write:\n\nm_\u03bc + K_\u03bc = sqrt( p_\u03bc\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, for the neutrino, since it's massless (or nearly massless), E_\u03bd = p_\u03bd c = p_\u03bd (again, c=1). So E_\u03bd = p_\u03bd. And since |p_\u03bc| = |p_\u03bd|, then E_\u03bd = p_\u03bc.\n\nSo substituting E_\u03bd = p_\u03bc into the energy equation:\n\nK_\u03bc + p_\u03bc = 33.9 MeV\n\nBut also, from the muon's energy:\n\nm_\u03bc + K_\u03bc = sqrt( p_\u03bc\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2 )\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(m_\u03bc + K_\u03bc)^2 = p_\u03bc\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nm_\u03bc\u00b2 + 2 m_\u03bc K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2 = p_\u03bc\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2\n\nSubtract m_\u03bc\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n2 m_\u03bc K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2 = p_\u03bc\u00b2\n\nBut from earlier, p_\u03bc = E_\u03bd = 33.9 - K_\u03bc\n\nSo substituting p_\u03bc = 33.9 - K_\u03bc into the equation:\n\n2 m_\u03bc K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2 = (33.9 - K_\u03bc)^2\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n(33.9 - K_\u03bc)^2 = 33.9\u00b2 - 2*33.9*K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2\n\nSo substituting back:\n\n2 m_\u03bc K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2 = 33.9\u00b2 - 2*33.9*K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2\n\nSubtract K_\u03bc\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n2 m_\u03bc K_\u03bc = 33.9\u00b2 - 2*33.9*K_\u03bc\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2 m_\u03bc K_\u03bc + 2*33.9*K_\u03bc - 33.9\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor out K_\u03bc:\n\nK_\u03bc (2 m_\u03bc + 2*33.9) = 33.9\u00b2\n\nTherefore:\n\nK_\u03bc = (33.9\u00b2) / (2 (m_\u03bc + 33.9))\n\nWait, let me check that step again. \n\nWait, the equation after moving terms:\n\n2 m_\u03bc K_\u03bc + 2*33.9*K_\u03bc = 33.9\u00b2\n\nFactor K_\u03bc:\n\nK_\u03bc (2 m_\u03bc + 2*33.9) = 33.9\u00b2\n\nTherefore:\n\nK_\u03bc = (33.9\u00b2) / [2 (m_\u03bc + 33.9)]\n\nBut m_\u03bc is 105.7 MeV. Let's plug in the numbers:\n\nFirst compute numerator: 33.9\u00b2\n\n33.9 squared: 33*33=1089, 0.9*33=29.7, 0.9*0.9=0.81, so (33 + 0.9)^2 = 33\u00b2 + 2*33*0.9 + 0.9\u00b2 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1089 + 60.21 = 1149.21. So 33.9\u00b2 = 1149.21 MeV\u00b2\n\nDenominator: 2*(105.7 + 33.9) = 2*(139.6) = 279.2\n\nSo K_\u03bc = 1149.21 / 279.2 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\nDivide 1149.21 by 279.2. Let's approximate:\n\n279.2 * 4 = 1116.8\n\n1149.21 - 1116.8 = 32.41\n\nSo 4 + 32.41 / 279.2 \u2248 4 + 0.116 \u2248 4.116 MeV\n\nSo approximately 4.12 MeV. Then, E_\u03bd = 33.9 - K_\u03bc \u2248 33.9 - 4.12 \u2248 29.78 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's probably the answer. Let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me verify the steps again.\n\nWe started with conservation of energy:\n\nE_\u03c0 = E_\u03bc + E_\u03bd\n\n139.6 = (105.7 + K_\u03bc) + E_\u03bd\n\nSo E_\u03bd = 139.6 - 105.7 - K_\u03bc = 33.9 - K_\u03bc\n\nConservation of momentum: |p_\u03bc| = |p_\u03bd|\n\nFor the muon: E_\u03bc\u00b2 = p_\u03bc\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2\n\nSo (105.7 + K_\u03bc)^2 = p_\u03bc\u00b2 + (105.7)^2\n\nExpanding left side: 105.7\u00b2 + 2*105.7*K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2 = p_\u03bc\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2\n\nSubtract 105.7\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n2*105.7*K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2 = p_\u03bc\u00b2\n\nBut p_\u03bc = E_\u03bd = 33.9 - K_\u03bc\n\nSo substitute:\n\n2*105.7*K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2 = (33.9 - K_\u03bc)^2\n\nWhich expands to:\n\n2*105.7*K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2 = 33.9\u00b2 - 2*33.9*K_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\u00b2\n\nCancel K_\u03bc\u00b2:\n\n2*105.7*K_\u03bc = 33.9\u00b2 - 2*33.9*K_\u03bc\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2*105.7*K_\u03bc + 2*33.9*K_\u03bc - 33.9\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor K_\u03bc:\n\nK_\u03bc*(2*105.7 + 2*33.9) = 33.9\u00b2\n\nSo K_\u03bc = (33.9\u00b2)/(2*(105.7 + 33.9)) = (33.9\u00b2)/(2*139.6)\n\nCompute numerator: 33.9*33.9 = 1149.21\n\nDenominator: 2*139.6 = 279.2\n\n1149.21 / 279.2 \u2248 4.116 MeV\n\nSo K_\u03bc \u2248 4.12 MeV, and E_\u03bd \u2248 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78 MeV \u2248 29.8 MeV. So answer D.\n\nBut wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy. Wait, the neutrino is massless, so its energy is entirely kinetic. So E_\u03bd is its kinetic energy. So the neutrino's KE is 29.8 MeV, and the muon's KE is 4.12 MeV. So answer D.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 3.52 MeV, 20.8 MeV\n\nB. 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV\n\nC. 7.2 MeV, 32.8 MeV\n\nD. 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV\n\nYes, D matches our calculation. So I think D is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me check again if I messed up any numbers.\n\nWait, 33.9 squared: 33 squared is 1089, 0.9 squared is 0.81, cross term 2*33*0.9=59.4. So total 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21. Correct.\n\nDenominator: 2*(105.7 + 33.9) = 2*139.6 = 279.2. Correct.\n\n1149.21 / 279.2 \u2248 4.116. Correct.\n\nSo yes, K_\u03bc \u22484.12 MeV, E_\u03bd\u224829.8 MeV. So answer D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check using another approach.\n\nAnother way: Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of each.\n\nFor the muon, total energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2) = m_\u03bc + K_\u03bc\n\nFor the neutrino, energy is p.\n\nTotal energy: sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2) + p = m_\u03c0\n\nSo sqrt(p\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) + p = 139.6\n\nLet me solve this equation numerically.\n\nLet me denote x = p. Then:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = 139.6 - x\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2 = (139.6 - x)^2\n\nExpand right side:\n\n139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6*x + x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n105.7\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 - 2*139.6*x\n\nThen:\n\n2*139.6*x = 139.6\u00b2 - 105.7\u00b2\n\nCompute 139.6\u00b2 - 105.7\u00b2. This is a difference of squares: (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) = (33.9)(245.3) = 33.9*245.3\n\nCalculate 33.9*245.3:\n\nFirst, 30*245.3 = 7359\n\n3.9*245.3 = 956.67\n\nTotal: 7359 + 956.67 = 8315.67\n\nSo 2*139.6*x = 8315.67\n\nTherefore, x = 8315.67 / (2*139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\n279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 - (8376 - 8315.67)/279.2 \u2248 30 - 60.33/279.2 \u2248 30 - 0.216 \u2248 29.784\n\nSo x \u224829.784 MeV/c (since momentum in units where c=1 is MeV/c). So the neutrino's energy is 29.784 MeV, which is approximately 29.8 MeV. Then, the muon's energy is sqrt(29.784\u00b2 + 105.7\u00b2) = sqrt(887.1 + 11172.5) = sqrt(12059.6) \u2248 109.8 MeV. Since the rest mass is 105.7 MeV, the kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. So again, approximately 4.1 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is answer D. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}"
