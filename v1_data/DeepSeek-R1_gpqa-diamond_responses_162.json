        "question": "We would like to dissolve (at 25\u00b0\u0421) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?\nA. pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3\nB. pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3\nC. pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3\nD. pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out how much 0.1 M monobasic strong acid is required to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 of solution, and then determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, so maybe I can check each one, but first, I should work through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and dissolving it in an acid would involve a neutralization reaction. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, it's likely HCl, HNO3, or something similar. The reaction would be:\n\nFe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3H2O\n\nSo, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions to dissolve. \n\nFirst, I need to calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3 in 0.1 g. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe (55.85) + 3*(O (16.00) + H (1.008)) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol.\n\nSo moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol \u2248 0.0009356 mol \u2248 9.356 x 10^-4 mol.\n\nSince each mole of Fe(OH)3 needs 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ required would be 3 * 9.356 x 10^-4 \u2248 2.8068 x 10^-3 mol.\n\nThe acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3. Since 1 dm\u00b3 = 1 L = 1000 cm\u00b3, the volume required would be moles / concentration = 2.8068 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3 = 0.028068 dm\u00b3 = 28.068 cm\u00b3. Hmm, so that's approximately 28.05 cm\u00b3? Looking at the options, D says 28.05 cm\u00b3 with pH 2.04. But wait, maybe there's more to it.\n\nWait, but dissolving Fe(OH)3 in acid will produce Fe\u00b3+ ions in solution. Fe\u00b3+ is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, which will affect the pH. So the pH isn't just determined by the excess acid, but also by the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nSo, after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution will contain Fe\u00b3+ ions. The pH will be influenced by both the excess H+ from the acid (if any) and the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nBut first, let's confirm the volume needed. If the stoichiometric amount is ~28.05 cm\u00b3, but maybe there's a need for excess acid? Wait, no, because the question says \"minimum volume\" needed. So the stoichiometric amount is exactly the moles required, assuming the acid is just enough to dissolve the Fe(OH)3. However, if Fe\u00b3+ hydrolyzes, releasing H+ back into solution, does that affect the amount of acid needed? Wait, no, because the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+ occurs after dissolution. The dissolution itself requires H+ to neutralize the OH- in Fe(OH)3. So the stoichiometric amount is correct. Therefore, the volume needed is approximately 28.05 cm\u00b3. Looking at the options, D and C have volumes around there. D is 28.05, which matches our calculation. But let's check the pH.\n\nAfter dissolving Fe(OH)3 with 28.05 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M HX (monobasic strong acid), the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3. So the total solution is 100 cm\u00b3, which includes the acid volume. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 total volume.\" So the acid is part of the 100 cm\u00b3 solution? Wait, that might complicate things. Wait, no. Wait, when they say \"dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm\u00b3 total volume,\" does that mean that the final solution volume is 100 cm\u00b3, which includes both the acid and the Fe(OH)3? Or is the acid added to 100 cm\u00b3 of solution? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the question says: \"What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?\" So the solution is prepared by adding the acid to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, and the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the volume of acid plus the volume of water (if any) needed to make up the solution to 100 cm\u00b3. But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its volume is negligible. So perhaps the acid is diluted to 100 cm\u00b3. Wait, but the problem says \"dissolve... in 100 cm\u00b3 total volume,\" so the total volume after dissolving is 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the acid volume plus any water added equals 100 cm\u00b3. But if we're using a certain volume of acid, and then diluting to 100 cm\u00b3, then the concentration of H+ would be affected by both the acid added and the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is simpler. Let me re-read the question:\n\n\"We would like to dissolve (at 25\u00b0\u0421) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume. What is the minimum volume (cm3) of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution and what is the pH of the resulting solution?\"\n\nSo, the total volume of the solution after dissolving is 100 cm\u00b3. The acid is used to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, and then possibly water is added to make up to 100 cm\u00b3. So the volume of acid required is V, and then water is added to reach 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the moles of H+ needed are still 2.8068 x 10^-3 mol, which would require V = 2.8068 x 10^-3 mol / 0.1 mol/dm\u00b3 = 0.028068 dm\u00b3 = 28.068 cm\u00b3. So approximately 28.05 cm\u00b3, which is option D. But then, the pH is given as 2.04 in option D. Let's check if that's correct.\n\nAfter dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution contains Fe\u00b3+ ions. The concentration of Fe\u00b3+ in 100 cm\u00b3 is moles / volume = 9.356 x 10^-4 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M. Fe\u00b3+ undergoes hydrolysis:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + 3H2O \u2194 Fe(OH)3 + 3H+\n\nThis reaction releases H+ ions, which will lower the pH. The pH is therefore determined by the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis constant (Kh) for Fe\u00b3+ can be calculated using the formula Kh = Kw / Ksp, but wait, actually, Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis is governed by its own equilibrium. The Ka for Fe\u00b3+ is often given as the acidic dissociation constant. Alternatively, the hydrolysis can be considered in steps. However, for simplicity, let's recall that the Ka for Fe\u00b3+ (acting as an acid) is approximately 6.3 x 10^-3, which corresponds to pKa \u2248 2.2. Wait, but different sources might have different values. Alternatively, the K for the first hydrolysis step Fe\u00b3+ + H2O \u2194 Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+ is about 6.3 x 10^-3, so pKa \u2248 2.2.\n\nIf the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.009356 M, then the contribution of H+ from hydrolysis can be estimated. Let's denote the concentration of H+ from hydrolysis as x. Then:\n\nKa = [Fe(OH)\u00b2+][H+] / [Fe\u00b3+] \u2248 6.3 x 10^-3\n\nAssuming x << 0.009356, but let's check:\n\nAt equilibrium:\n\n[Fe(OH)\u00b2+] \u2248 x\n\n[H+] \u2248 x (since each Fe\u00b3+ releases one H+)\n\n[Fe\u00b3+] \u2248 0.009356 - x \u2248 0.009356\n\nSo:\n\nKa \u2248 x^2 / 0.009356 = 6.3 x 10^-3\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx^2 = 6.3 x 10^-3 * 0.009356 \u2248 5.90 x 10^-5\n\nx \u2248 sqrt(5.90 x 10^-5) \u2248 0.00768 M\n\nBut wait, 0.00768 M is comparable to 0.009356 M, so the assumption that x << 0.009356 is invalid. Therefore, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 / (0.009356 - x) = 6.3 x 10^-3\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.009356 - x):\n\nx^2 = 6.3 x 10^-3 * (0.009356 - x)\n\nx^2 = 5.90 x 10^-5 - 6.3 x 10^-3 x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx^2 + 6.3 x 10^-3 x - 5.90 x 10^-5 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-6.3e-3 \u00b1 sqrt((6.3e-3)^2 + 4*1*5.90e-5)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n(6.3e-3)^2 + 4*1*5.90e-5 = 3.969e-5 + 2.36e-4 = 2.7569e-4\n\nsqrt(2.7569e-4) \u2248 0.0166\n\nSo x = [-6.3e-3 \u00b1 0.0166]/2\n\nTake positive root:\n\nx = ( -0.0063 + 0.0166 ) / 2 \u2248 0.0103 / 2 \u2248 0.00515 M\n\nSo [H+] \u2248 0.00515 M, which would correspond to pH \u2248 -log10(0.00515) \u2248 2.29\n\nBut wait, this is just from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+. However, in the solution, we also have the H+ from the acid added. Wait, no\u2014the acid is a strong monobasic acid, so all the H+ from the acid would have been consumed in dissolving the Fe(OH)3. Wait, no. Wait, the acid provides H+ to react with Fe(OH)3. The reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3H2O\n\nSo, the H+ from the acid is consumed stoichiometrically to produce Fe\u00b3+ and water. Therefore, after the reaction, the H+ in solution comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+ and any excess acid. But since we're using the minimum volume of acid, there should be no excess acid. Therefore, all the H+ from the acid is consumed, and the H+ in solution comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nBut wait, if we added exactly the stoichiometric amount of H+ to dissolve Fe(OH)3, then theoretically, there's no excess H+ left. However, Fe\u00b3+ will hydrolyze to produce H+, so the pH is determined by that hydrolysis.\n\nSo, the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.009356 M, and as calculated, the [H+] from hydrolysis is approximately 0.00515 M, giving pH \u2248 2.29. However, none of the options have pH 2.29. The closest is option B (2.69) and D (2.04). Hmm. Maybe my approximation is off, or perhaps I used an incorrect Ka value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider all three hydrolysis steps of Fe\u00b3+. Fe\u00b3+ can hydrolyze in three steps:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u2194 Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+ (K1)\n\nFe(OH)\u00b2+ + H2O \u2194 Fe(OH)2+ + H+ (K2)\n\nFe(OH)2+ + H2O \u2194 Fe(OH)3 + H+ (K3)\n\nHowever, the first hydrolysis step is the most significant, with K1 \u2248 6.3 x 10^-3, while subsequent steps have much smaller K values. Therefore, the majority of H+ comes from the first hydrolysis step.\n\nBut even considering only the first step, our calculation gave pH \u2248 2.29, which isn't exactly any of the options. Let's check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is different. Let's recalculate the moles:\n\nFe(OH)3 molar mass: Fe = 55.85, O = 16.00*3 = 48.00, H = 1.008*3 = 3.024. Total = 55.85 + 48.00 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol. So 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol \u2248 0.0009356 mol. Correct.\n\nMoles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009356 \u2248 0.0028068 mol. Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm\u00b3. So approximately 28.05 cm\u00b3, which matches option D. Then, the pH in option D is 2.04. But according to our calculation, pH should be around 2.29. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution's pH is solely due to the excess acid. Wait, but if we added exactly the stoichiometric amount, there's no excess acid. Unless the Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis is considered as contributing to the acidity. Wait, but that's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dissolution is not complete unless the solution is acidic enough to keep Fe\u00b3+ in solution. Wait, Fe(OH)3 has a solubility product Ksp. If we dissolve it in acid, we convert it into Fe\u00b3+ and water. Once dissolved, the Fe\u00b3+ may hydrolyze, but as long as the pH is low enough, Fe\u00b3+ remains in solution. However, if the pH is too high, Fe(OH)3 will precipitate again. But since we're using a strong acid, once dissolved, the solution should remain acidic enough to keep Fe\u00b3+ in solution.\n\nBut perhaps the question is considering that after dissolution, the pH is determined by the concentration of H+ from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+. Let's recast the problem.\n\nAfter dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the minimum amount of acid, the solution contains Fe\u00b3+ at a concentration of 0.009356 M (since 0.0009356 mol in 0.1 L). The hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+ will produce H+:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u2194 Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium expression is:\n\nKa = [Fe(OH)\u00b2+][H+] / [Fe\u00b3+]\n\nAssuming Ka \u2248 6.3 x 10^-3 (pKa \u2248 2.2), let's denote x as the concentration of H+ produced. Then:\n\nKa = x^2 / (0.009356 - x) \u2248 6.3 x 10^-3\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.009356, then:\n\nx^2 \u2248 6.3 x 10^-3 * 0.009356 \u2248 5.90 x 10^-5\n\nx \u2248 sqrt(5.90 x 10^-5) \u2248 0.00768 M\n\nBut 0.00768 M is not small compared to 0.009356 M, so the assumption is invalid. Therefore, solving the quadratic:\n\nx^2 + 6.3 x 10^-3 x - 5.90 x 10^-5 = 0\n\nAs before, discriminant is (6.3e-3)^2 + 4*1*5.90e-5 = 3.969e-5 + 2.36e-4 = 2.7569e-4\n\nsqrt(2.7569e-4) \u2248 0.0166\n\nx = [-6.3e-3 + 0.0166]/2 \u2248 (0.0103)/2 \u2248 0.00515 M\n\nSo [H+] = 0.00515 M, pH = -log(0.00515) \u2248 2.29\n\nBut none of the options have pH 2.29. The closest is option D (2.04) and B (2.69). Hmm. Maybe the Ka value used is different. Let me check standard Ka values for Fe\u00b3+.\n\nUpon checking, the first hydrolysis constant (K1) for Fe\u00b3+ is actually around 1.6 x 10^-3, which corresponds to pKa \u2248 2.8. If that's the case, let's recalculate.\n\nUsing K1 = 1.6 x 10^-3:\n\nKa = x^2 / (0.009356 - x) = 1.6 x 10^-3\n\nAssuming x is small:\n\nx^2 \u2248 1.6 x 10^-3 * 0.009356 \u2248 1.497 x 10^-5\n\nx \u2248 sqrt(1.497 x 10^-5) \u2248 0.00387 M\n\nBut again, this is not negligible compared to 0.009356, so solving quadratic:\n\nx^2 + 1.6e-3 x - 1.6e-3 * 0.009356 = 0\n\nx^2 + 0.0016x - 0.00001497 = 0\n\nDiscriminant: (0.0016)^2 + 4*1*0.00001497 \u2248 0.00000256 + 0.00005988 \u2248 0.00006244\n\nsqrt(0.00006244) \u2248 0.0079\n\nx = [-0.0016 + 0.0079]/2 \u2248 0.0063/2 \u2248 0.00315 M\n\npH = -log(0.00315) \u2248 2.5\n\nStill not matching any options. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is more extensive, or maybe there is an excess of acid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all the H+ from the acid is consumed. Let's re-examine the stoichiometry.\n\nThe reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3H2O\n\nMoles of H+ needed: 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.0009356 \u2248 0.0028068 mol\n\nVolume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm\u00b3. So the acid volume is ~28.07 cm\u00b3. The total solution volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\nBut if the acid is 28.07 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M H+, then the moles of H+ added are 0.1 M * 0.02807 L = 0.002807 mol, which exactly reacts with the Fe(OH)3. Therefore, there is no excess H+; all H+ is consumed in the reaction. Therefore, the H+ in solution comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation with K1 = 6.3e-3, pH \u2248 2.29, which isn't an option. If K1 is higher, say 1.2e-2, then:\n\nKa = 1.2e-2 = x^2 / (0.009356 - x)\n\nAssuming x^2 \u2248 1.2e-2 * 0.009356 \u2248 1.1227e-4\n\nx \u2248 0.0106 M, which would give pH \u2248 1.97, which is closer to option D's pH of 2.04.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that after dissolution, the solution contains excess H+ because the stoichiometric amount was not exact. Wait, but we calculated the stoichiometric amount as ~28.07 cm\u00b3. If one of the options is 28.05 cm\u00b3 (option D), which is very close, then perhaps the pH is calculated considering both the hydrolysis and any excess acid.\n\nWait, but if we add exactly 28.05 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M acid, the moles of H+ are 0.1 * 0.02805 = 0.002805 mol. The moles needed are 0.0028068 mol. So there's a slight deficiency of H+ (0.002805 vs 0.0028068), but that's negligible. Therefore, effectively, all H+ is consumed, and pH is determined by Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the acid is in excess, and the pH is calculated from the excess H+? But the question asks for the minimum volume, which would be the stoichiometric amount, so no excess. Therefore, pH should be from Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis.\n\nBut none of the options match the calculated pH. The options given are:\n\nA. pH 4.94; 20.40 cm\u00b3\n\nB. pH 2.69; 30.09 cm\u00b3\n\nC. pH 3.16; 32.14 cm\u00b3\n\nD. pH 2.04; 28.05 cm\u00b3\n\nOur calculated volume is ~28.05 cm\u00b3 (option D), but pH we calculated is ~2.29, but option D says pH 2.04. Maybe there's another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution takes into account the dilution of the acid. Wait, the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, which includes the acid volume. So when we add V cm\u00b3 of acid to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the total volume is made up to 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M, regardless of the acid volume. But the H+ from the acid is consumed, and the H+ from hydrolysis is in 0.1 L.\n\nWait, but if the acid is diluted to 100 cm\u00b3, then the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is still 0.009356 M. The hydrolysis calculation remains the same. So pH should still be around 2.29. But option D says pH 2.04. Maybe the problem is using a different K value for Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dissolution reaction is not considered to go to completion unless excess acid is added. But the question specifies the minimum volume, which should be stoichiometric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hydrolysis calculation. Let's try using the exact solution.\n\nWe have:\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / (C - [H+]) where C = 0.009356 M\n\nRearranging:\n\n[H+]^2 = Ka*(C - [H+])\n\nLet's plug in Ka = 6.3e-3:\n\n[H+]^2 = 6.3e-3*(0.009356 - [H+])\n\nLet me denote [H+] = x.\n\nx\u00b2 = 6.3e-3*(0.009356 - x)\n\nx\u00b2 + 6.3e-3 x - 6.3e-3*0.009356 = 0\n\nx\u00b2 + 0.0063x - 5.90e-5 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-0.0063 \u00b1 sqrt(0.0063\u00b2 + 4*1*5.90e-5)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n0.0063\u00b2 = 0.00003969\n\n4*5.90e-5 = 0.000236\n\nTotal discriminant = 0.00003969 + 0.000236 = 0.00027569\n\nsqrt(0.00027569) \u2248 0.0166\n\nThus,\n\nx = [-0.0063 + 0.0166]/2 \u2248 0.0103/2 \u2248 0.00515 M\n\npH = -log(0.00515) \u2248 2.29\n\nStill getting pH ~2.29. Not matching any options. Maybe the given answer assumes that all three H+ ions from Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis contribute, but that's not accurate because each hydrolysis step has a much smaller K. Let's check.\n\nIf we consider three hydrolysis steps, each releasing one H+:\n\nFe\u00b3+ \u2192 Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+ (K1)\n\nFe(OH)\u00b2+ \u2192 Fe(OH)2+ + H+ (K2)\n\nFe(OH)2+ \u2192 Fe(OH)3 + H+ (K3)\n\nBut K1 >> K2 >> K3. For Fe\u00b3+, K1 \u2248 6.3e-3, K2 \u2248 1.6e-4, K3 \u2248 1.0e-5. So the first step dominates, and the contribution from the second and third steps is negligible. Therefore, total [H+] \u2248 0.00515 M from first step, pH \u22482.29.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that Fe\u00b3+ has a higher charge density and thus more acidic. Let's check another source for Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis constant.\n\nAccording to some sources, the hydrolysis constant for Fe\u00b3+ (K1) is approximately 1.0 x 10^-3, which would give:\n\nKa = 1.0e-3 = x\u00b2 / (0.009356 - x)\n\nAssuming x is small:\n\nx\u00b2 \u2248 1.0e-3 * 0.009356 \u2248 9.356e-6\n\nx \u2248 0.00306 M\n\npH \u2248 -log(0.00306) \u2248 2.51\n\nStill not matching. Alternatively, if K1 is 2.0e-3:\n\nx\u00b2 \u2248 2.0e-3 * 0.009356 \u2248 1.871e-5\n\nx \u2248 0.00432 M\n\npH \u2248 2.36\n\nStill not matching options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering the solution as a strong acid solution.\n\nWait, if after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution contains Fe\u00b3+ and Cl- (if HCl is used), but Cl- is a spectator ion. The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nBut none of the options match our calculation. The closest is option D (pH 2.04). Let's see what pH 2.04 corresponds to in terms of [H+].\n\n[H+] = 10^-2.04 \u2248 0.00912 M\n\nIf [H+] = 0.00912 M, then:\n\nFrom hydrolysis:\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / (C - [H+]) = (0.00912)^2 / (0.009356 - 0.00912) \u2248 (0.0000832) / (0.000236) \u2248 0.3525\n\nBut Ka = 0.3525 is way too high for Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis. That's not possible. Therefore, this suggests that option D's pH of 2.04 is incorrect based on hydrolysis calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution's pH is calculated as if it's a solution of Fe(NO3)3 or FeCl3, which are acidic due to Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis. The pH of such solutions can be around 2-3 depending on concentration.\n\nFor example, a 0.01 M FeCl3 solution has a pH around 2.0-2.5. Our concentration is ~0.009356 M, which is slightly less than 0.01 M, so pH should be slightly higher, around 2.2-2.3. But option D says pH 2.04, which is lower (more acidic). Maybe the problem is using a different concentration.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, when we dissolve Fe(OH)3 in acid, the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3. The moles of Fe\u00b3+ are 0.0009356 mol. So concentration is 0.0009356 / 0.1 = 0.009356 M. If the pH of a 0.01 M FeCl3 solution is ~2.0, then a 0.009356 M solution would have a pH slightly higher, say ~2.04? Maybe the answer assumes that the pH is approximately equal to the pKa of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nIf the pKa is around 2.0, then pH would be around 2.0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is treating Fe\u00b3+ as a strong acid, which it is not. Fe\u00b3+ is a weak acid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is incorrect, but given the options, D is the only one with the correct volume. However, the pH calculation doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something in the stoichiometry.\n\nWait, let's recheck the molar mass of Fe(OH)3:\n\nFe: 55.85 g/mol\n\nO: 16.00 * 3 = 48.00 g/mol\n\nH: 1.008 * 3 = 3.024 g/mol\n\nTotal: 55.85 + 48.00 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol. Correct.\n\nMoles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1 / 106.874 \u2248 0.0009356 mol. Correct.\n\nMoles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009356 \u2248 0.0028068 mol. Correct.\n\nVolume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm\u00b3. Correct. So option D's volume is correct.\n\npH calculation: If the pH is 2.04, [H+] = 10^-2.04 \u2248 0.00912 M. If this [H+] is from Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis, then:\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / (C - [H+]) = (0.00912)^2 / (0.009356 - 0.00912) \u2248 0.0000832 / 0.000236 \u2248 0.3525\n\nBut Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis constant is not 0.35. That's way too high. Therefore, this suggests that the pH of 2.04 is incorrect. However, option D is the only one with the correct volume. Maybe the answer is D, despite the pH discrepancy, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the acid is in excess. Let's see. If we take option B: 30.09 cm\u00b3 of acid. Moles of H+ = 0.1 * 0.03009 = 0.003009 mol. Moles needed = 0.0028068 mol. Excess H+ = 0.003009 - 0.0028068 = 0.0002022 mol. Concentration of excess H+ in 100 cm\u00b3 = 0.0002022 / 0.1 = 0.002022 M. pH = -log(0.002022) \u2248 2.69, which matches option B. But the volume here is 30.09 cm\u00b3, which is more than the stoichiometric amount. But the question asks for the minimum volume, which should be 28.05 cm\u00b3. Therefore, option B is not the minimum.\n\nSimilarly, option C: 32.14 cm\u00b3. Moles H+ = 0.1 * 0.03214 = 0.003214 mol. Excess H+ = 0.003214 - 0.0028068 = 0.0004072 mol. [H+] = 0.0004072 / 0.1 = 0.004072 M. pH \u2248 2.39, but option C says pH 3.16. Doesn't match.\n\nOption A: 20.40 cm\u00b3. Moles H+ = 0.1 * 0.02040 = 0.00204 mol. This is less than needed (0.0028068 mol), so it's insufficient to dissolve all Fe(OH)3. Therefore, incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only option D has the correct volume. Even though the pH calculation doesn't match our expectation, perhaps the answer assumes that the pH is calculated differently, such as considering activity coefficients or a different hydrolysis constant. Given that option D is the only one with the correct volume, and the pH is closest to our rough calculation (2.29 vs 2.04), perhaps the answer is D.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}"

            "text": "Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is more extensive, or maybe there is an excess of acid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that all the H+ from the acid is consumed. Let's re-examine the stoichiometry.\n\nThe reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3H2O\n\nMoles of H+ needed: 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.0009356 \u2248 0.0028068 mol\n\nVolume of 0.1 M acid: 0.0028068 / 0.1 = 0.028068 L = 28.068 cm\u00b3. So the acid volume is ~28.07 cm\u00b3. The total solution volume is 100 cm\u00b3, so the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M.\n\nBut if the acid is 28.07 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M H+, then the moles of H+ added are 0.1 M * 0.02807 L = 0.002807 mol, which exactly reacts with the Fe(OH)3. Therefore, there is no excess H+; all H+ is consumed in the reaction. Therefore, the H+ in solution comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation with K1 = 6.3e-3, pH \u2248 2.29, which isn't an option. If K1 is higher, say 1.2e-2, then:\n\nKa = 1.2e-2 = x^2 / (0.009356 - x)\n\nAssuming x^2 \u2248 1.2e-2 * 0.009356 \u2248 1.1227e-4\n\nx \u2248 0.0106 M, which would give pH \u2248 1.97, which is closer to option D's pH of 2.04.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that after dissolution, the solution contains excess H+ because the stoichiometric amount was not exact. Wait, but we calculated the stoichiometric amount as ~28.07 cm\u00b3. If one of the options is 28.05 cm\u00b3 (option D), which is very close, then perhaps the pH is calculated considering both the hydrolysis and any excess acid.\n\nWait, but if we add exactly 28.05 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M acid, the moles of H+ are 0.1 * 0.02805 = 0.002805 mol. The moles needed are 0.0028068 mol. So there's a slight deficiency of H+ (0.002805 vs 0.0028068), but that's negligible. Therefore, effectively, all H+ is consumed, and pH is determined by Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the acid is in excess, and the pH is calculated from the excess H+? But the question asks for the minimum volume, which would be the stoichiometric amount, so no excess. Therefore, pH should be from Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis.\n\nBut none of the options match the calculated pH. The options given are:\n\nA. pH 4.94; 20.40 cm\u00b3\n\nB. pH 2.69; 30.09 cm\u00b3\n\nC. pH 3.16; 32.14 cm\u00b3\n\nD. pH 2.04; 28.05 cm\u00b3\n\nOur calculated volume is ~28.05 cm\u00b3 (option D), but pH we calculated is ~2.29, but option D says pH 2.04. Maybe there's another factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution takes into account the dilution of the acid. Wait, the total volume is 100 cm\u00b3, which includes the acid volume. So when we add V cm\u00b3 of acid to dissolve Fe(OH)3, the total volume is made up to 100 cm\u00b3. Therefore, the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M, regardless of the acid volume. But the H+ from the acid is consumed, and the H+ from hydrolysis is in 0.1 L.\n\nWait, but if the acid is diluted to 100 cm\u00b3, then the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ is still 0.009356 M. The hydrolysis calculation remains the same. So pH should still be around 2.29. But option D says pH 2.04. Maybe the problem is using a different K value for Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dissolution reaction is not considered to go to completion unless excess acid is added. But the question specifies the minimum volume, which should be stoichiometric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hydrolysis calculation. Let's try using the exact solution.\n\nWe have:\n\nKa = [H+]^2 / (C - [H+]) where C = 0.009356 M\n\nRearranging:\n\n[H+]^2 = Ka*(C - [H+])\n\nLet's plug in Ka = 6.3e-3:\n\n[H+]^2 = 6.3e-3*(0.009356 - [H+])\n\nLet me denote [H+] = x.\n\nx\u00b2 = 6.3e-3*(0.009356 - x)\n\nx\u00b2 + 6.3e-3 x - 6.3e-3*0.009356 = 0\n\nx\u00b2 + 0.0063x - 5.90e-5 = 0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-0.0063 \u00b1 sqrt(0.0063\u00b2 + 4*1*5.90e-5)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n0.0063\u00b2 = 0.00003969\n\n4*5.90e-5 = 0.000236\n\nTotal discriminant = 0.00003969 + 0.000236 = 0.00027569\n\nsqrt(0.00027569) \u2248 0.0166\n\nThus,\n\nx = [-0.0063 + 0.0166]/2 \u2248 0.0103/2 \u2248 0.00515 M\n\npH = -log(0.00515) \u2248 2.29\n\nStill getting pH ~2.29. Not matching any options. Maybe the given answer assumes that all three H+ ions from Fe\u00b3+ hydrolysis contribute, but that's not accurate because each hydrolysis step has a much smaller K. ",
