        "question": "You are analyzing a small peptidic compound that has been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound appears consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals (together they integrate to 1H - the expected integral); based on the coupling pattern, you can rule out spin-spin coupling as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound at elevated temperature shows two clearly defined peaks of equal intensities. Both peaks have the same mass spectrum, which is consistent with the expected molecule. What is the most likely explanation for these observations?\nA. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers\nB. The compound is contaminated with a precursor\nC. 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction\nD.

        "response": "The most likely explanation for these observations is:\n\n**A. The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Duplicate peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum**: The presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, suggests that the compound exists in two distinct forms. Since spin-spin coupling has been ruled out, this points to the existence of two different environments for the alpha-proton, which is consistent with diastereoisomers.\n\n2. **LC-MS analysis**: The two peaks observed in the LC-MS analysis have the same mass spectrum, indicating that they are chemically identical in terms of molecular weight and structure. However, they elute at different retention times, which is characteristic of diastereoisomers (they have different physical properties and thus separate in chromatography).\n\n3. **Diastereoisomers vs. enantiomers**: Diastereoisomers have different physical properties (e.g., NMR chemical shifts, chromatographic retention times), whereas enantiomers are chemically identical in an achiral environment and would not separate in standard LC-MS or show distinct NMR peaks. Therefore, the observations are consistent with diastereoisomers, not enantiomers.\n\n4. **Other options**:\n   - **B. Contamination with a precursor**: This would likely show different masses in the LC-MS and distinct NMR peaks unrelated to the expected molecule.\n   - **C. Double coupling during amide-bond formation**: This would result in a different molecular structure or mass, which is not observed here.\n   - **D. Mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers would not show distinct peaks in NMR or LC-MS under achiral conditions.\n\nThus, the most plausible explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers."
