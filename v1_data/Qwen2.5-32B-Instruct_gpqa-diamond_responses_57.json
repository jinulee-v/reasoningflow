        "response": "Among the options provided:\n\nA. **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** - This theory, which describes the interactions of quarks and gluons, does require regularization techniques to handle infinities that arise in calculations, particularly at high energies.\n\nB. **Superstring Theory** - This is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. It aims to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. While it is designed to be free from the infinities that plague other quantum field theories, the full understanding and formulation of superstring theory are still areas of active research. However, within the context of the question, superstring theory is often considered as a candidate for a theory that could potentially avoid the need for regularization due to its higher-dimensional nature and the way it handles the interactions at very small scales.\n\nC. **Classical Electrodynamics** - This theory does not involve quantum effects and thus does not require regularization. However, it is not a quantum theory and does not describe phenomena at the quantum level where regularization becomes necessary.\n\nD. **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)** - This is a quantum field theory of electromagnetism. Like other quantum field theories, QED requires regularization techniques to deal with divergences that appear in calculations, especially at high energies.\n\nGiven these explanations, the answer that best fits the criteria of a theory that never requires regularization at high energies is:\n\nB. **Superstring Theory**\n\nIt's important to note that while superstring theory is a strong candidate for avoiding the need for regularization, the definitive proof or complete understanding of this aspect is still an area of ongoing research and debate in theoretical physics."
