        "question": "You want to study the role of the GADD45G protein in a mouse model. You are highly interested in whether the IL-2-induced protein has a role in the SARS-CoV-2 infection. You decide to create a transgenic mouse model with the inducible overexpression of the coding sequence for the GADD45G gene. You can use it to affinity-purify the protein and identify the protein partners that bind to GADD45G after you infect the mice with the virus. For that purpose, you will modify the gene's coding sequence by introducing the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant that will be at the N-terminus of your recombinant protein. You genetically engineer the plasmid and, aided by Lipofectamine\u00ae, transfect it into the Chinese hamster ovary cells. You select the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies to test the expression level of your construct. Once you begin, you observe that you are unable to overexpress your protein as you expected.

The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation",
        "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out why the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. The user created a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of GADD45G, modified with an HA tag (influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant) at the N-terminus. They transfected CHO cells with the plasmid and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the protein isn't expressing properly.\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence provided, which is the plus strand (so same as mRNA except T instead of U). The construct should have the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The HA tag sequence is usually a short peptide, like YPYDVPDYA, which corresponds to the amino acids Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala. Let's check the beginning of the DNA sequence to see if the HA tag is correctly encoded.\n\nThe DNA starts with ATG, which is the start codon (Met). Then TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAA... Let's translate the first part:\n\nATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA ...\n\nTranslating this:\n\nATG = Met\nTAC = Tyr\nCCA = Pro\nTAC = Tyr\nGAT = Asp\nGTT = Val\nCCA = Pro\nGAT = Asp\nTAC = Tyr\nGCC = Ala\nAAA = Lys\n\nSo the amino acid sequence starts as Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala-Lys... That looks correct for the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA). The HA tag is usually inserted right after the start codon, so the Met is followed by the HA tag. So the HA tag sequence seems correct here. Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. The construct starts with Met followed by HA tag, then the rest of GADD45G. So the HA tag is correctly placed here.\n\nNow, possible issues: A, B, C, D.\n\nOption A: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. Linker sequences are sometimes added between tags and the protein to prevent steric hindrance. If the HA tag is directly fused without a linker, maybe the structure is causing the protein to be recognized as misfolded and degraded. But the question says the construct includes the HA tag sequence. However, the answer options don't mention linker presence, but A says lack of linker triggers proteolysis. But would that prevent overexpression entirely? Maybe, but maybe the protein is just degraded. But the user can't detect overexpression, so maybe the protein is being made but rapidly degraded. However, the user tested expression levels and found it low. But the initial observation is inability to overexpress. If the protein is degraded, maybe the mRNA is still there but protein isn't. But the answer options don't mention mRNA stability. Alternatively, maybe the construct has another issue.\n\nOption B: Ribosome terminated translation early. That would be due to a premature stop codon. Let's check the DNA sequence for in-frame stop codons. Let's scan the DNA sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons in the same reading frame as the start codon.\n\nThe DNA sequence starts with ATG (start), then the HA tag, then the rest. Let's check frame. The HA tag is in frame, then continues. Let's look through the sequence for stop codons. The given DNA sequence ends with TGAGTGA. The last part is TGA, which is a stop codon. But that's at the end. Let's check if there's an early stop codon.\n\nLooking at the DNA sequence:\n\nAfter the initial ATG, the HA tag is correctly translated. Let's see further. Let's take the entire DNA sequence and translate it step by step to check for premature stops.\n\nBut this might take time. Alternatively, look for any in-frame stop codons. Let's split the DNA into triplets starting from ATG.\n\nThe full sequence is:\n\n5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGT CGG CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCG ACA ATG TGA CCT TCT GTG TGC TGG CTG CGG GTG AGG AGG ACG AGG GCG ACA TCG CGC TGC AGA TCC ATT TTA CGC TGA TCC AGG CTT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACA TCG ACA TAG TGC GCG TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CTA TCG TGG GCG CCG GCG AGG AGG CGG GTG CGC CGG GCG ACC TGC ACT GCA TCC TCA TTT CGA ACC CCA ACG AGG ACG CCT GGA AGG ATC CCG CCT TGG AGA AGC TCA GCC TGT TTT GCG AGG AGA GCC GCA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA CCC TCC CGA GTA 3'\n\nWait, the user mentions that the plus strand sequence is given. So the mRNA would be the same as this sequence but with U instead of T. Let's check for stop codons in the coding sequence.\n\nLooking through the sequence:\n\nAfter the start codon (ATG), let's go step by step:\n\nFirst few codons (already translated earlier) up to AAA (Lys). Then TGA (stop codon) at position ... Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA (positions 1-30 nucleotides?), then next codon is TGA (positions 31-33?), which is a stop codon. Wait, let's count:\n\nATG (1-3), TAC (4-6), CCA (7-9), TAC (10-12), GAT (13-15), GTT (16-18), CCA (19-21), GAT (22-24), TAC (25-27), GCC (28-30), AAA (31-33). Wait, AAA is Lys. Then next codon is TGA (34-36), which is a stop codon. So after the HA tag sequence, there's a TGA stop codon. That would terminate translation prematurely. So the HA tag is followed by a stop codon, so the protein is just the HA tag plus a few amino acids before the stop. Hence, the full-length protein isn't made. Therefore, ribosome terminates early (option B).\n\nBut wait, let's check the exact sequence. The user's construct sequence is:\n\nStarting from 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... So after the start codon, the HA tag is encoded as TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA. Translating:\n\nTAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys). Then the next codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the protein would be Met followed by YPYDVPDYAK, then a stop. That's only 10 amino acids (including the initial Met). So the recombinant protein is truncated, hence not overexpressed as expected. The stop codon is present early in the sequence, causing premature termination. Therefore, answer B is correct.\n\nBut why is there a TGA there? The HA tag should be followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The original GADD45G sequence shouldn't have a stop codon there. So this TGA is an introduced mutation, perhaps a cloning error. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted in a way that introduced a frame shift, but in this case, the HA tag is in frame, followed by AAA (Lys), then TGA. Wait, the HA tag's last amino acid is Ala (GCC), then AAA is Lys, then TGA. So the HA tag is correctly in frame, but after that, there's a TGA. That's a problem. So the construct has an early stop codon, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early (option B). Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nOther options: Option C talks about UAA codon tRNA not existing. In mouse cells, UAA is a stop codon, which is recognized by release factors, not tRNA. So if there's a UAA stop codon, translation would terminate. But in this case, the stop codon is TGA (UGA in mRNA), which is a standard stop codon. So the presence of TGA would cause termination regardless of tRNA, because release factors handle that. So option C is incorrect. Option D: antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. The HA tag sequence here translates correctly to YPYDVPDYA (assuming the last Ala is from GCC, which is correct). Wait, HA tag is usually YPYDVPDYA. Let's check:\n\nThe HA tag in the DNA is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC. Translating:\n\nTAC = Tyr, CCA = Pro, TAC = Tyr, GAT = Asp, GTT = Val, CCA = Pro, GAT = Asp, TAC = Tyr, GCC = Ala. So the HA tag here is YPYDVPDYA, which is correct. Then AAA (Lys) and TGA (stop). So the HA tag is correct, but immediately after, there's a Lys and then a stop. So the antigenic determinant sequence is correct, but there's an early stop codon. Therefore, the problem isn't a missense mutation in the HA tag (option D is incorrect). The issue is the premature stop codon (option B). So answer B."
