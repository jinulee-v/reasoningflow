        "question": "A dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene was dehydrated to the corresponding anhydride. This anhydride, which has a single peak (7 ppm) in its 1H NMR spectrum and two peaks (137 ppm, 165 ppm) in its 13C spectrum, was reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to yield two products (a major and a minor product). Both products have a molecular formula of C13H16O3.\n\nThe 2D NOESY NMR spectra of the major and minor products were taken. A cross-peak was present in the spectrum of the major product but absent (or very weak) in spectrum of the minor product.\n\nIn the spectrum of the major product, which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak (integrals are taken from the corresponding 1H NMR)?\nA.

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided about the reaction and the NMR data for both the major and minor products.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the starting materials and the reaction:\n- The dicarboxylic acid containing a cis-alkene is dehydrated to form an anhydride.\n- The anhydride has a single peak in its 1H NMR spectrum at 7 ppm, indicating that all protons are equivalent.\n- In the 13C NMR spectrum, there are two peaks: one at 137 ppm and another at 165 ppm. These peaks suggest the presence of carbonyl groups (likely from the anhydride structure).\n\nWhen this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, it forms two products with the molecular formula C13H16O3. The presence of a cross-peak in the 2D NOESY NMR spectrum of the major product indicates spatial proximity between the nuclei involved in the cross-peak.\n\nGiven the options for the cross-peak connections in the 2D NOESY NMR spectrum:\n\nA. A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm\nB. A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nC. A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm\nD. A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm\n\nWe need to determine which pair of resonances are spatially close enough to show a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum. \n\nConsidering the molecular formula and the typical structures formed in such Diels-Alder reactions, the most plausible scenario involves interactions between methyl groups or other substituents that are close in space due to the stereochemistry of the product.\n\nOption B suggests a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This combination could indicate a spatial relationship where a proton in a doublet (possibly from a methylene group) is close to a singlet (possibly from a methyl group).\n\nOption C suggests a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This combination also indicates a spatial relationship between two sets of methyl groups.\n\nGiven the context of the Diels-Alder reaction and the typical stereochemistry involved, the most likely scenario is that the cross-peak connects a methylene group (doublet) to a methyl group (singlet), as these are often found in close proximity in the product.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm**"
