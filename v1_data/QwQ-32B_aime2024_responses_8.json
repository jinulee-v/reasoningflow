        "question": "There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$.",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms with variables in the base and the argument. That might be a bit tricky, but let me see if I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall the definition of a logarithm. The expression log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So, applying that to the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. That should mean that x^10 = y^x. Similarly, the second equation log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 would mean that y^10 = x^{4y}. \n\nSo, translating both equations into exponential form, I get:\n\n1. x^{10} = y^{x}\n2. y^{10} = x^{4y}\n\nNow, I need to solve these two equations for x and y, and then find their product. Since both equations involve exponents with x and y in both the base and the exponent, this might require some substitution or taking logarithms again to linearize the equations. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me see.\n\nStarting with the first equation: x^{10} = y^{x}. Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to see if that helps. Taking ln:\n\nln(x^{10}) = ln(y^{x})\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10 ln x = x ln y\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: y^{10} = x^{4y}\n\nTaking natural logs again:\n\nln(y^{10}) = ln(x^{4y})\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n10 ln y = 4y ln x\n\nHmm, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. 10 ln x = x ln y  --> Equation (1)\n2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x --> Equation (2)\n\nHmm, so these are two equations with variables x and y. Maybe I can solve one equation for one variable in terms of the other and substitute?\n\nLet me see. Let me denote ln x as A and ln y as B to make it simpler. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet A = ln x, B = ln y. Then the equations become:\n\n1. 10 A = x B\n2. 10 B = 4y A\n\nBut x and y are related to A and B via x = e^{A}, y = e^{B}. Hmm, so substituting x and y in terms of A and B into the equations:\n\nFirst equation: 10 A = e^{A} * B\n\nSecond equation: 10 B = 4 e^{B} * A\n\nHmm, so now we have:\n\n10 A = e^{A} B --> Equation (1a)\n\n10 B = 4 e^{B} A --> Equation (2a)\n\nHmm, perhaps I can solve for one variable in terms of the other from the first equation and substitute into the second.\n\nFrom Equation (1a): Let's solve for B:\n\nB = (10 A) / e^{A}\n\nThen plug this into Equation (2a):\n\n10 * (10 A / e^{A}) = 4 e^{B} A\n\nSimplify left side: 100 A / e^{A} = 4 e^{B} A\n\nWe can divide both sides by A (assuming A \u2260 0, but since x >1, ln x is positive, so A >0, so that's okay):\n\n100 / e^{A} = 4 e^{B}\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\ne^{B} = (100)/(4 e^{A}) = 25 / e^{A}\n\nSo, e^{B} = 25 e^{-A}\n\nBut since B = ln y and A = ln x, then e^{B} = y and e^{A} = x. Therefore:\n\ny = 25 / x\n\nSo, that's a relation between y and x: y = 25/x. Okay, so that's helpful. Let me note that down: y = 25/x.\n\nNow, substitute this back into one of the original equations. Let's pick the first equation: x^{10} = y^{x}\n\nSince y =25/x, substitute:\n\nx^{10} = (25/x)^x\n\nHmm, so x^{10} = (25/x)^x\n\nHmm, that's an equation in x. Let me see if I can solve this. Let me take natural logs of both sides again to make it manageable.\n\nln(x^{10}) = ln( (25/x)^x )\n\nWhich gives:\n\n10 ln x = x ln(25/x)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\nx [ ln 25 - ln x ] = x ln25 - x ln x\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 = 0\n\nFactor terms with ln x:\n\nln x (10 + x) - x ln25 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let me rearrange terms:\n\nx ln x + 10 ln x - x ln25 =0\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms differently:\n\nx (ln x - ln25) + 10 ln x =0\n\nHmm, ln x - ln25 is ln(x/25). So:\n\nx ln(x/25) +10 ln x =0\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can let t = ln x, so that x = e^t. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet t = ln x, so x = e^t. Then ln(x/25) = ln(e^t /25) = t - ln25. Similarly, ln x = t.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\ne^t ( t - ln25 ) + 10 t =0\n\nHmm, so:\n\ne^t ( t - ln25 ) +10 t =0\n\nThis is a transcendental equation in t. These are often difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe I can look for a solution where t is a multiple of ln5 or something, since 25 is 5 squared. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an integer solution? Let me test some possible values.\n\nSuppose x is 5. Let me check if that works.\n\nIf x =5, then y =25/x =5. So y=5. Let me check the original equations.\n\nFirst equation: log_x(y^x) = log_5(5^5) = 5, but we need it to be 10. So that's not good.\n\nHmm, so x=5 gives 5 instead of 10. Not enough.\n\nWhat if x is sqrt(25) =5, but that's same as above.\n\nWait, maybe x is 25? Let me try x=25. Then y=25/25=1. But y must be greater than 1. So that's invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe x is something else. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x is  sqrt(25) but raised to some power. Wait, maybe x is 5^(2/ something). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can write the equation again:\n\nx^{10} = (25/x)^x\n\nLet me write 25 as 5^2, so:\n\nx^{10} = (5^2 /x)^x =5^{2x}/x^x\n\nTherefore, moving all terms to left:\n\nx^{10} *x^x =5^{2x}\n\nSo x^{x +10} =5^{2x}\n\nTake natural logs again:\n\n(x +10) ln x = 2x ln5\n\nHmm, so (x +10) ln x = 2x ln5\n\nHmm, perhaps rearranged as:\n\n(x +10) ln x - 2x ln5 =0\n\nStill a transcendental equation. Maybe I can let u = x, and try to see if there's a solution where x is a power of 5? Let me try x=5^k, where k is some exponent.\n\nLet me suppose x=5^k. Then ln x =k ln5, and substituting into the equation:\n\n(5^k +10)*k ln5 = 2*5^k * ln5\n\nDivide both sides by ln5 (since ln5 \u22600):\n\n(5^k +10)k = 2*5^k\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nk*5^k +10k =2*5^k\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nk*5^k +10k -2*5^k =0\n\nFactor 5^k terms:\n\n5^k (k -2) +10k =0\n\nHmm, so 5^k (k -2) = -10k\n\nHmm, perhaps trying integer values for k?\n\nLet me try k=2:\n\nLeft side:5^2 (2-2)=25*0=0, right side: -10*2=-20. Not equal.\n\nk=3:\n\n5^3 (3-2)=125*1=125; right side: -10*3=-30. Not equal.\n\nk=1:\n\n5^1 (1-2)=5*(-1)=-5; right side: -10*1=-10. Not equal.\n\nk=4:\n\n5^4*(4-2)=625*2=1250; right side: -40. Nope.\n\nk=0: Not allowed, since x>1, so k must be positive.\n\nHmm, maybe k= something between 2 and 3?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me rearrange the equation:\n\n5^k (k -2) = -10k\n\nSo,\n\n5^k = -10k/(k-2)\n\nBut since 5^k is always positive, the right-hand side must also be positive. Therefore,\n\n-10k/(k -2) >0\n\nSo, the numerator and denominator must have opposite signs.\n\nNumerator: -10k. Since k is positive (as x>1, so k>0), numerator is negative.\n\nDenominator: (k -2). So to have overall positive, denominator must be negative. Therefore,\n\nk -2 <0 --> k <2.\n\nSo k must be between 0 and 2.\n\nSo possible k between 0 and 2. Let me try k=1. Let's see:\n\nAt k=1,\n\nLeft side:5^1*(1-2)=5*(-1)=-5\n\nRight side: -10*1= -10. Not equal.\n\nWait, but in the equation 5^k (k -2) = -10k,\n\nAt k=1, left side is -5, right side is -10. Not equal.\n\nk=1.5:\n\nLeft side:5^{1.5}*(1.5 -2)=5^{1.5}*(-0.5). 5^1.5 is 5*sqrt(5)\u22485*2.236\u224811.18, so 11.18*(-0.5)\u2248-5.59\n\nRight side: -10*(1.5)= -15. Not equal.\n\nHmm, k=1. Let me try k= something else.\n\nWait, maybe k= (something else). Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the equation (x +10) ln x = 2x ln5.\n\nLet me rearrange this as:\n\n(x +10)/x * ln x = 2 ln5\n\nWhich is:\n\n(1 + 10/x) ln x = 2 ln5\n\nHmm, perhaps trying x=5^(something). Let me suppose that x=5^m, so that ln x = m ln5. Then substituting into the equation:\n\n(1 +10/(5^m)) * m ln5 = 2 ln5\n\nDivide both sides by ln5:\n\n(1 +10/5^m)*m =2\n\nSo,\n\nm + (10m)/5^m =2\n\nHmm, so m +10m /5^m =2\n\nHmm, perhaps trying m=1:\n\n1 +10*1/5 =1 +2=3\u22602\n\nm=2:\n\n2 + 20/25=2 +0.8=2.8\u22602\n\nm=1.5:\n\n1.5 +15/(5^{1.5})=1.5 +15/(11.1803)\u22481.5 +1.34\u22482.84\u22602\n\nHmm, m=0. Let's see m=0. Not allowed, since x>1.\n\nHmm, m= something less than 1?\n\nLet me try m=0. Let's see, but m must be positive.\n\nWait, m=0. Let me see m=0. Let me see m=0. Let me see m=0. Let me see m=0. Hmm, but m=0 would give x=1, which is not allowed.\n\nHmm, m=0.5:\n\n0.5 + (10*0.5)/sqrt(5) \u22480.5 +5/2.236\u22480.5 +2.236\u22482.736\u22602\n\nHmm, m=0. Let me see m=0. Let me see m=0. Hmm, maybe m= something like 1. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= log_5 (something). Hmm, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use numerical methods here. Since this is a competition problem, perhaps there is an integer solution or a nice fractional exponent that I can find.\n\nWait, let me check the second equation again. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution earlier?\n\nWait, let me recap. The original equations were:\n\n1. log_x(y^x)=10 --> x^{10}=y^x\n\n2. log_y(x^{4y})=10 --> y^{10}=x^{4y}\n\nThen, from the first equation, we found that y=25/x. Then substituting into the first equation gives x^{10}=(25/x)^x, which led us to the equation (x +10) ln x =2x ln5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the second equation with y=25/x. Let me try that.\n\nSecond equation: y^{10}=x^{4y}\n\nSubstituting y=25/x:\n\n(25/x)^{10}=x^{4*(25/x)}\n\nSimplify left side:25^{10}/x^{10}\n\nRight side: x^{100/x}\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n25^{10}/x^{10} =x^{100/x}\n\nHmm, that's another equation involving x. Let me see if this can be combined with the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking logs here as well.\n\nTake natural logs of both sides:\n\n10 ln25 -10 lnx = (100/x) lnx\n\nHmm, so:\n\n10 ln25 -10 lnx - (100/x) lnx =0\n\nHmm, let me factor out lnx:\n\nlnx [ -10 -100/x ] +10 ln25 =0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let me write this as:\n\n10 ln25 =10 lnx + (100/x) lnx\n\nFactor lnx:\n\n10 ln25 = lnx (10 + 100/x )\n\nHmm, so:\n\nlnx = [10 ln25 ] / [10 + 100/x ]\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying denominator:\n\n10 +100/x =10(1 +10/x )\n\nThus,\n\nlnx = [10 ln25 ] / [10(1 +10/x ) ] = [ln25]/[1 +10/x ]\n\nSo,\n\nlnx = (ln25)/(1 +10/x )\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote t = x. Then,\n\nln t = (ln25)/(1 +10/t )\n\nHmm, perhaps cross multiplying:\n\nln t * (1 +10/t ) = ln25\n\nSo,\n\nln t + (10/t) ln t = ln25\n\nHmm, this seems similar to the equation we had before. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set u = ln t, so that t = e^u. Then,\n\nu + (10 / e^u ) u = ln25\n\nHmm, so,\n\nu (1 +10 e^{-u} ) = ln25\n\nHmm, still transcendental. Maybe trying to guess a value for u?\n\nLet me see, ln25 is approximately 3.218.\n\nSuppose u=2, then:\n\nLeft side:2*(1 +10/e^2 )\u22482*(1 +10/7.389)\u22482*(1 +1.353)\u22482*2.353\u22484.706>3.218\n\nToo big.\n\nu=3:\n\n3*(1 +10/e^3 )\u22483*(1 +10/20.085)\u22483*(1 +0.498)\u22483*1.498\u22484.494>3.218\n\nStill too big.\n\nu=1:\n\n1*(1 +10/e )\u22481*(1 +10/2.718)\u22481*(1 +3.678)\u22484.678>3.218\n\nHmm, still higher.\n\nWait, maybe u less than 1?\n\nu=0.5:\n\n0.5*(1 +10/e^{0.5})\u22480.5*(1 +10/1.648)\u22480.5*(1 +6.06)\u22480.5*7.06\u22483.53, which is close to 3.218.\n\nHmm, closer. Let me compute more accurately.\n\nCompute e^{0.5}=sqrt(e)\u22481.64872\n\nThus, 10 /1.64872\u22486.0653\n\nThus, 1 +6.0653\u22487.0653\n\nMultiply by 0.5: 3.5326, which is still higher than ln25\u22483.218.\n\nHmm, so need u a bit lower?\n\nWait, let me try u=0.4:\n\ne^{0.4}\u2248e^{0.4}\u22481.4918\n\n10 /1.4918\u22486.703\n\n1 +6.703\u22487.703\n\nMultiply by 0.4: 3.081, which is less than 3.218.\n\nSo between u=0.4 and u=0.5.\n\nLet me try u=0.45:\n\ne^{0.45}\u2248e^{0.4}*e^{0.05}\u22481.4918*1.0513\u22481.5683\n\n10 /1.5683\u22486.376\n\n1 +6.376\u22487.376\n\nMultiply by 0.45: 7.376*0.45\u22483.319, which is still higher than 3.218.\n\nHmm, so u=0.45 gives 3.319, which is still higher.\n\nu=0.43:\n\ne^{0.43}\u2248e^{0.4}*e^{0.03}\u22481.4918*1.0305\u22481.536\n\n10/1.536\u22486.51\n\n1 +6.51\u22487.51\n\nMultiply by 0.43: 7.51*0.43\u22483.229, which is very close to 3.218.\n\nHmm, so u\u22480.43 gives us approximately 3.229, which is just a bit over.\n\nWait, let me compute more precisely.\n\nLet me compute u=0.425:\n\ne^{0.425}=e^{0.4}*e^{0.025}\u22481.4918 *1.0253\u22481.4918*1.0253\u22481.529\n\n10/1.529\u22486.543\n\n1 +6.543\u22487.543\n\nMultiply by 0.425: 7.543*0.425\u22483.200\n\nHmm, that's very close to 3.218. Wait, 7.543*0.425:\n\n7 *0.425=2.975, 0.543*0.425\u22480.230, so total\u22483.205. Hmm, so 3.205 vs target 3.218. Close.\n\nSo, u\u22480.425 gives 3.205, which is 0.013 less than needed. Let me try u=0.43:\n\nEarlier, at u=0.43, we had approx 3.229, which is 0.011 over. So the solution is between 0.425 and 0.43.\n\nLet me try u=0.4275:\n\ne^{0.4275}=e^{0.4 +0.0275}=e^0.4 * e^0.0275\u22481.4918 *1.0279\u22481.4918*1.0279\u22481.533\n\n10/1.533\u22486.523\n\n1 +6.523\u22487.523\n\nMultiply by 0.4275: 7.523 *0.4275\u2248\n\n7 *0.4275=2.9925, 0.523*0.4275\u22480.223, total\u22483.2155. Close to 3.218. So u\u22480.4275 gives 3.2155, which is 0.0025 less.\n\nHmm, so maybe u\u22480.428:\n\ne^{0.428}=approx?\n\nLet me compute 0.428:\n\nLet me use Taylor series for e^x around x=0.425?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use linear approximation between 0.425 and 0.43.\n\nAt u=0.425, value is 3.205\n\nAt u=0.43, value is 3.229\n\nWe need to reach 3.218, which is 3.218 -3.205=0.013 above the lower value.\n\nThe difference between the two points is 3.229 -3.205=0.024 over an interval of 0.005 in u.\n\nSo, to get 0.013, need (0.013 /0.024)*0.005\u2248 (0.5417)*0.005\u22480.0027. So u\u22480.425 +0.0027\u22480.4277.\n\nThus, approximate solution u\u22480.4277, so x= e^{0.4277}\u2248e^{0.4277}\n\nCompute e^0.4277:\n\nWe know e^0.4\u22481.4918, e^0.4277= e^{0.4 +0.0277}=1.4918 * e^{0.0277}\n\ne^{0.0277}\u22481 +0.0277 + (0.0277)^2/2\u22481 +0.0277 +0.000383\u22481.02808\n\nThus, 1.4918 *1.02808\u22481.4918*1.028\u22481.4918 +1.4918*0.028\u22481.4918 +0.0418\u22481.5336\n\nSo x\u22481.5336, and y=25/x\u224825/1.5336\u224816.30\n\nHmm, so x\u22481.5336, y\u224816.30. Then, the product xy\u22481.5336*16.30\u224825. So, wait, 25? Because y=25/x, so xy=25. Wait, that's interesting. Wait, if y=25/x, then xy=25. So actually, the product is 25? But the problem says \"Find xy\". So maybe the answer is 25? But let me check.\n\nWait, hold on. If y=25/x, then indeed xy=25. So regardless of the values of x and y, as long as y=25/x, their product is 25. But does that hold?\n\nWait, but in the equations, we had from the first substitution that y=25/x. Therefore, their product is 25. So, perhaps the answer is 25? But then why go through all that trouble solving equations?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nFrom the first equation, after substituting, we had:\n\nFrom equation (1a): 10A = e^A B\n\nFrom equation (2a):10B =4 e^B A\n\nThen, substituting B from (1a) into (2a):\n\n10*(10A/e^A) =4 e^B A\n\nThen, 100A/e^A =4 e^B A\n\nCancel A (since A\u22600):\n\n100/e^A =4 e^B\n\nThus,\n\ne^B =25/e^A\n\nTherefore, e^{A + B}=25\n\nBut e^{A + B}=e^{A} e^{B}=x*y. Since A=lnx, B=lny, so e^{A+B}=e^{lnx +lny}=e^{ln(xy)}=xy.\n\nTherefore, xy=25.\n\nWait a second! So actually, from the equations, we can directly get that xy=25. So regardless of the specific values of x and y, their product must be 25. Therefore, the answer is 25. So all that solving was unnecessary? Because the problem only asks for xy, which can be found directly from the equations without solving for x and y individually.\n\nWow, that's a good lesson. I should have noticed that earlier. Let me recap:\n\nStarting from the two equations:\n\n10 ln x = x ln y --> Equation 1\n\n10 ln y =4y ln x --> Equation 2\n\nLet me call Equation1: 10 lnx =x ln y --> (10/x) lnx = ln y\n\nEquation2:10 ln y =4y lnx --> (10/4y) ln y = lnx\n\nSo substituting ln y from Equation1 into Equation2:\n\n(10/4y)*(10/x lnx ) = lnx\n\nAssuming lnx \u22600 (which it isn't since x>1), we can divide both sides by lnx:\n\n(10/4y)*(10/x ) =1\n\nThus,\n\n(100)/(4xy)=1 --> 100=4xy --> xy=25.\n\nOh my goodness, that's so much simpler. I overcomplicated it by substituting variables and trying to solve for x and y individually. But if I just manipulate the equations together, I can find xy directly. That's the key here.\n\nSo the answer is 25. Therefore, the product xy is 25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{25}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem, we need to find the product \\(xy\\) where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers greater than 1 that satisfy the equations \\(\\log_x(y^x) = 10\\) and \\(\\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\\).\n\nFirst, we convert the logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:\n1. \\(\\log_x(y^x) = 10\\) implies \\(x^{10} = y^x\\).\n2. \\(\\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\\) implies \\(y^{10} = x^{4y}\\).\n\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of these equations:\n1. For \\(x^{10} = y^x\\), taking the natural logarithm gives \\(10 \\ln x = x \\ln y\\).\n2. For \\(y^{10} = x^{4y}\\), taking the natural logarithm gives \\(10 \\ln y = 4y \\ln x\\).\n\nWe now have the system of equations:\n1. \\(10 \\ln x = x \\ln y\\)\n2. \\(10 \\ln y = 4y \\ln x\\)\n\nWe solve these equations by expressing \\(\\ln y\\) from the first equation and substituting into the second. From the first equation:\n\\[\n\\ln y = \\frac{10 \\ln x}{x}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(\\ln y\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n10 \\left( \\frac{10 \\ln x}{x} \\right) = 4y \\ln x\n\\]\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{100 \\ln x}{x} = 4y \\ln x\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\(\\ln x \\neq 0\\) (since \\(x > 1\\)), we can divide both sides by \\(\\ln x\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{100}{x} = 4y\n\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\\[\ny = \\frac{25}{x}\n\\]\n\nThus, the product \\(xy\\) is:\n\\[\nxy = x \\left( \\frac{25}{x} \\right) = 25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the product \\(xy\\) is \\(\\boxed{25}\\)."
