        "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me first parse the problem statement again to make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nWe have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form the segment AB. Then there's this family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ in F has P somewhere on the x-axis, Q somewhere on the y-axis, and the length PQ is 1. The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F except for AB itself. Then we need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, expressed as a reduced fraction p/q, and then give p + q.\n\nAlright, let's start by visualizing the problem. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. AB is a line segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all unit length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So each such segment PQ connects a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. The claim is that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So AB is part of the family F because OA is 1/2 and OB is sqrt(3)/2, but wait, OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, so the length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is indeed a segment of unit length connecting the x-axis to the y-axis, hence AB is in F. So C is a point on AB such that C isn't on any other segment PQ in F except AB itself. Then we need to find OC\u00b2.\n\nFirst, let me parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the parametric equations for AB can be written as:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - t)\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2) t\n\nwhere t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we are at A, and when t=1, we are at B. So any point C on AB can be represented as ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, the problem states that C is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for C to lie on another segment PQ from F, there must exist another segment PQ (different from AB) in F such that C is on PQ.\n\nTherefore, we need to find t such that the point C = ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t ) does not lie on any other PQ in F. The only PQ in F that contains C is AB itself.\n\nSo, to find such a point C, we need to ensure that there are no other segments PQ in F passing through C. So, equivalently, for all other possible segments PQ in F (i.e., different from AB), the point C does not lie on PQ.\n\nTherefore, we need to find t such that the system of equations defining PQ (which is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1) passing through C has only AB as a solution.\n\nWait, PQ is a segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) with length 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. The line PQ can be parametrized as (p - p*s, q*s) where s ranges from 0 to 1. Alternatively, the equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, if a point (x, y) lies on PQ, then x/p + y/q = 1, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nGiven that C is ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t ), we can substitute x and y into the equation x/p + y/q = 1. So:\n\n[(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]/q = 1\n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can write p = sqrt(1 - q\u00b2) or q = sqrt(1 - p\u00b2). However, since p and q are in the first quadrant, they are positive.\n\nSo, substituting x and y into the line equation:\n\n[(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]/q = 1\n\nBut p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. [(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]/q = 1\n\n2. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nWe need to find t such that this system has only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), which corresponds to the segment AB. If there exists another solution (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), then C would lie on another segment PQ in F, which we don't want.\n\nTherefore, we need to find t such that the system above has a unique solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, the equations must be satisfied only by that p and q. Therefore, for other p and q, the equations should not hold. So, perhaps the system has a unique solution when the equation obtained by substituting p and q in terms of each other leads to a quadratic equation with discriminant zero, i.e., a repeated root. That might correspond to the case where the line x/p + y/q = 1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1 at the point (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Wait, but (1/2, sqrt(3)/2) is on the unit circle since (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, perhaps the line x/p + y/q = 1 is tangent to the unit circle at (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Then, the condition for tangency is that the line is tangent to the circle at that point.\n\nWait, but the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, and PQ is a chord of the unit circle connecting (p, 0) to (0, q). But if (p, q) is on the unit circle, then PQ is a chord, but tangency would require that the line is tangent at some point. However, in our case, the line PQ connects two points on the axes, so unless p or q is 1, the line PQ is not tangent to the unit circle.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's think of the family F as all segments from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, each such segment is part of the line x/p + y/q = 1. So, the set of all such lines forms a family of lines where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. The point C must lie only on the line corresponding to AB, which is when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the point C on AB such that there are no other lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1 passing through C. So, geometrically, this would mean that C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Wait, the envelope of the family F is the curve that is tangent to each member of the family. But here, we are looking for a point that is only on one member of the family. Alternatively, perhaps C is the common point of all envelopes except AB? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think of the set of all lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. Each such line corresponds to a point (p, q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant. The point C is on AB, and we want that C is not on any other such line. So, if we parametrize C as ( (1 - t)/2 , (sqrt(3)/2) t ), then substituting into x/p + y/q = 1 gives an equation in p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. We need this system to have only the solution p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2. So, for other values of p and q, there should be no solution. Therefore, the system:\n\n[(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]/q = 1\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nshould have only the solution p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2. To ensure that, perhaps the equation obtained by eliminating variables should have only that solution. Let me try to eliminate variables.\n\nLet me denote x = (1 - t)/2 and y = (sqrt(3)/2) t. So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2) t. Then, solving for t, we can express t from the y-coordinate: t = (2 y)/sqrt(3). Then, substituting into x: x = (1 - (2 y)/sqrt(3))/2. So, x = (1/2) - (y)/sqrt(3). So, the relation between x and y on AB is x = 1/2 - y / sqrt(3). Alternatively, multiplying both sides by sqrt(3): sqrt(3) x + y = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation of AB is sqrt(3) x + y = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nBut perhaps this is not immediately helpful. Let's go back to the system:\n\n[(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]/q = 1\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nWe can write the first equation as:\n\n(1 - t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2q) = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by 2pq:\n\nq(1 - t) + p sqrt(3) t = 2pq\n\nSo:\n\nq(1 - t) + p sqrt(3) t = 2pq\n\nBut p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. Let's denote this as equation (1):\n\nq(1 - t) + p sqrt(3) t = 2pq\n\nEquation (2):\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nWe need to solve this system for p and q, given t, and find t such that the only solution is p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, for a given t, the system may have multiple solutions (p, q). We need to find t such that the system has only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, for such t, the equations must be satisfied only by that p and q.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express q from equation (1) in terms of p, substitute into equation (2), and then set the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation to zero, so that there's only one solution. Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nq(1 - t) + p sqrt(3) t = 2pq\n\nLet's rearrange terms:\n\nq(1 - t) - 2pq + p sqrt(3) t = 0\n\nFactor q:\n\nq(1 - t - 2p) + p sqrt(3) t = 0\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq = [ - p sqrt(3) t ] / (1 - t - 2p )\n\nNow substitute this into equation (2):\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nSo:\n\np\u00b2 + [ ( - p sqrt(3) t ) / (1 - t - 2p ) ]\u00b2 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2 + ( 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 ) / (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2 = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2\n\nLet me denote D = 1 - t - 2p. Then:\n\np\u00b2 D\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = D\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\np\u00b2 D\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 - D\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor D\u00b2:\n\nD\u00b2 (p\u00b2 - 1) + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nBut D = 1 - t - 2p, so substitute back:\n\n(1 - t - 2p )\u00b2 (p\u00b2 - 1) + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe expanding everything would help, but it might get messy. Let's try expanding step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2:\n\n= (1 - t)^2 - 4p(1 - t) + 4p\u00b2\n\n= 1 - 2t + t\u00b2 - 4p + 4pt + 4p\u00b2\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n[1 - 2t + t\u00b2 - 4p + 4pt + 4p\u00b2] (p\u00b2 - 1) + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nNow, multiply each term inside the brackets by (p\u00b2 - 1):\n\n(1 - 2t + t\u00b2)(p\u00b2 - 1) - 4p(p\u00b2 - 1) + 4pt(p\u00b2 - 1) + 4p\u00b2(p\u00b2 - 1) + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Let's compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)(p\u00b2 - 1) = (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)p\u00b2 - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: -4p(p\u00b2 - 1) = -4p\u00b3 + 4p\n\nThird term: 4pt(p\u00b2 - 1) = 4p\u00b3 t - 4p t\n\nFourth term: 4p\u00b2(p\u00b2 - 1) = 4p\u2074 - 4p\u00b2\n\nFifth term: 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n(1 - 2t + t\u00b2)p\u00b2 - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) -4p\u00b3 + 4p + 4p\u00b3 t - 4p t + 4p\u2074 - 4p\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n- Terms with p\u2074: 4p\u2074\n\n- Terms with p\u00b3: -4p\u00b3 + 4p\u00b3 t\n\n- Terms with p\u00b2: (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)p\u00b2 -4p\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2\n\n- Terms with p: 4p -4p t\n\n- Constant term: - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)\n\nSo:\n\n4p\u2074 + (-4 + 4t)p\u00b3 + [ (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) -4 + 3 t\u00b2 ]p\u00b2 + (4 -4t)p - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) = 0\n\nSimplify each coefficient:\n\nFor p\u2074: 4\n\nFor p\u00b3: 4(t - 1)\n\nFor p\u00b2: (1 - 2t + t\u00b2 -4 + 3t\u00b2) = (1 -4) + (-2t) + (t\u00b2 + 3t\u00b2) = -3 -2t +4t\u00b2\n\nFor p: 4(1 - t)\n\nConstant term: - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n4p\u2074 + 4(t -1)p\u00b3 + (-3 -2t +4t\u00b2)p\u00b2 +4(1 - t)p - (1 -2t + t\u00b2) =0\n\nThis is a quartic equation in p. Solving this quartic equation seems very complicated. Maybe there's a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we are looking for t such that the only solution is p =1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2, perhaps substituting p =1/2 into the equation and solving for t would give the required condition. Wait, but we need to ensure that p=1/2 is the only solution. So, perhaps substituting p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2 into equation (1) and seeing what t is, but that would just confirm that AB passes through C for all t. Wait, but AB is the segment from A to B, so all points on AB are covered as t varies from 0 to1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to find t such that when we solve the system [(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ]/q = 1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, the only solution is p=1/2, q=sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, for such t, substituting into the equations would yield p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2 as the only solution.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can set up the equations such that when we solve for p and q, the equations have a unique solution. For a system of equations, having a unique solution usually means that the equations are independent and consistent. However, in this case, since we have two equations and two variables, typically there could be multiple solutions. So, to have only one solution, perhaps the equations are such that the solution is unique. Wait, but p and q are variables on the unit circle, and the line equation. So, geometrically, a line intersecting the circle can have two intersection points, but in our case, the line PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), so p and q are positive. So, the line x/p + y/q =1 intersects the unit circle at (p,0) and (0,q). So, unless the line is tangent to the circle, which would only intersect at one point. But PQ is a chord, not a tangent. Wait, unless p or q is 1, in which case the line would be tangent at (1,0) or (0,1). But in our case, PQ is a chord between (p,0) and (0,q), both different from (1,0) and (0,1) since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, unless p=1 and q=0 or vice versa, but those are excluded since PQ is in the first quadrant with positive p and q.\n\nWait, but in our problem, PQ is a unit length segment from the x-axis to the y-axis. So, PQ connects (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So, PQ is a chord of the unit circle from (p,0) to (0,q). So, unless PQ is AB itself, which connects (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the problem is that point C is on AB, and we need to ensure that C is not on any other such chord PQ.\n\nTherefore, geometrically, C is a point on AB such that there is no other chord PQ of the unit circle (from x-axis to y-axis) passing through C. So, such a point C is called a \"unique intersection\" point or something similar. Maybe this relates to the concept of the envelope of all such chords PQ. The envelope is a curve tangent to all such chords. Then, the point C would be the point where AB is tangent to the envelope. Therefore, finding the envelope of the family F might help.\n\nAlternatively, the set of all such chords PQ forms a family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The envelope of this family can be found by solving for the curve tangent to all these lines. The envelope would satisfy both x/p + y/q =1 and the derivative of the equation with respect to the parameter (which is p or q) equals zero.\n\nBut since p and q are related by p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, we can parametrize p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8 for \u03b8 in [0, \u03c0/2]. Then, the line equation becomes x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1. The envelope is found by solving this equation along with its derivative with respect to \u03b8.\n\nSo, let's parametrize p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2). Then, the line equation is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we take the derivative of the equation with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, write the equation as:\n\nx sec\u03b8 + y csc\u03b8 =1\n\nTake derivative with respect to \u03b8:\n\nx sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 - y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8 =0\n\nSo:\n\nx sec\u03b8 tan\u03b8 = y csc\u03b8 cot\u03b8\n\nSimplify:\n\nx (1/cos\u03b8)(sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8) = y (1/sin\u03b8)(cos\u03b8/sin\u03b8)\n\nx (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8) = y (cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8)\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8:\n\nx sin\u03b8 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = y cos\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8\n\nx sin\u00b3\u03b8 = y cos\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\nx / y = (cos\u00b3\u03b8) / (sin\u00b3\u03b8) = (cot\u03b8)^3\n\nTherefore,\n\ncot\u03b8 = (x / y)^{1/3}\n\nBut from the original equation x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1, we can express cot\u03b8 as (x / y)^{1/3}\n\nLet me denote cot\u03b8 = k, so k = (x/y)^{1/3} => k\u00b3 = x/y => x = y k\u00b3\n\nSubstitute into the original equation:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1\n\nBut cot\u03b8 = k = cos\u03b8 / sin\u03b8 => cos\u03b8 = k sin\u03b8\n\nSo, substitute cos\u03b8 = k sin\u03b8 into the equation:\n\nx / (k sin\u03b8) + y / sin\u03b8 =1\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8:\n\nx / k + y = sin\u03b8\n\nBut x = y k\u00b3, so substitute:\n\n(y k\u00b3)/k + y = sin\u03b8 => y k\u00b2 + y = sin\u03b8 => y(k\u00b2 +1) = sin\u03b8\n\nBut cos\u03b8 = k sin\u03b8, and since cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\n(k sin\u03b8)^2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1 => sin\u00b2\u03b8(k\u00b2 +1) =1 => sin\u03b8 =1 / sqrt(k\u00b2 +1)\n\nTherefore, y(k\u00b2 +1) =1 / sqrt(k\u00b2 +1)\n\nThus,\n\ny =1 / [ (k\u00b2 +1 ) sqrt(k\u00b2 +1) ] =1 / (k\u00b2 +1 )^{3/2}\n\nBut x = y k\u00b3 = k\u00b3 / (k\u00b2 +1 )^{3/2}\n\nTherefore, parametrizing in terms of k, we have:\n\nx = k\u00b3 / (k\u00b2 +1 )^{3/2}\n\ny =1 / (k\u00b2 +1 )^{3/2}\n\nSo, the envelope is given parametrically by these equations. To find the Cartesian equation, note that:\n\nLet\u2019s set t = k\u00b2. Then,\n\nx = t^{3/2} / (t +1 )^{3/2}\n\ny =1 / (t +1 )^{3/2}\n\nBut x/y = t^{3/2} => (x/y)^{2/3} = t\n\nSo, t = (x/y)^{2/3}\n\nSubstitute into y =1 / (t +1 )^{3/2}:\n\ny =1 / [ (x/y)^{2/3} +1 ]^{3/2}\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 2/3:\n\ny^{2/3} =1 / [ (x/y)^{2/3} +1 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by [ (x/y)^{2/3} +1 ]:\n\ny^{2/3} [ (x/y)^{2/3} +1 ] =1\n\nSimplify:\n\ny^{2/3} (x^{2/3} y^{-2/3} +1 ) =1\n\nDistribute:\n\nx^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1\n\nAh! So the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.\n\nTherefore, the astroid is the envelope of all these segments PQ. So, the astroid is tangent to each segment PQ in the family F. Therefore, the point C must be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1. Because if C is on AB and not on any other PQ, then AB must be tangent to the astroid at C. Otherwise, if AB intersects the astroid at C, then there would be another PQ passing through C. Wait, but the astroid is the envelope, meaning each PQ is tangent to the astroid. Therefore, the point of tangency is on the astroid and on PQ. But AB is a member of F, so AB is tangent to the astroid at some point. Wait, but AB is a chord of the unit circle, not a tangent. Wait, perhaps AB is tangent to the astroid at point C. Therefore, point C is the point of tangency of AB with the astroid. Therefore, C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.\n\nTherefore, to find C, we need to find the point on AB where AB is tangent to the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.\n\nSo, let's parametrize AB as before: x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2) t.\n\nWe need to find t such that the line AB is tangent to the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1 at the point (x(t), y(t)).\n\nAlternatively, substituting x(t) and y(t) into the astroid equation and ensuring that the point lies on the astroid and the derivative condition for tangency.\n\nWait, but AB is a straight line. For AB to be tangent to the astroid, the point C must lie on both AB and the astroid, and the tangent line to the astroid at C must coincide with AB.\n\nSo, first, find the point C on AB that also lies on the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.\n\nSo, substituting x = (1 - t)/2 and y = (sqrt(3)/2) t into the astroid equation:\n\n[ ((1 - t)/2 )^{2/3} ] + [ ( (sqrt(3)/2 ) t )^{2/3} ] =1\n\nSimplify:\n\n( (1 - t)/2 )^{2/3} + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 )^{2/3} =1\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[(1 - t)^{2/3}]/(2^{2/3}) + [ (sqrt(3) t)^{2/3} ]/(2^{2/3}) =1\n\nFactor out 1/(2^{2/3}):\n\n[ (1 - t)^{2/3} + (sqrt(3) t)^{2/3} ] / 2^{2/3} =1\n\nMultiply both sides by 2^{2/3}:\n\n(1 - t)^{2/3} + (sqrt(3) t)^{2/3} = 2^{2/3}\n\nLet me denote s = t. Then:\n\n(1 - s)^{2/3} + (sqrt(3) s)^{2/3} = 2^{2/3}\n\nThis equation needs to be solved for s. Let's raise both sides to the power of 3/2 to eliminate the exponents. Wait, but exponents are 2/3, so raising to 3/2 would give us linear terms. Let me check:\n\nLet\u2019s denote A = (1 - s)^{2/3}, B = (sqrt(3) s)^{2/3}\n\nThen, A + B = 2^{2/3}\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3/2:\n\n(A + B)^{3/2} = (2^{2/3})^{3/2} =2^{1} =2\n\nBut expanding (A + B)^{3/2} is not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps make a substitution.\n\nLet\u2019s set u = (1 - s)^{1/3}, v = (sqrt(3) s)^{1/3}\n\nThen, A = u\u00b2, B = v\u00b2\n\nSo, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = 2^{2/3}\n\nBut also, u\u00b3 =1 - s, v\u00b3 = sqrt(3) s\n\nExpress s from v\u00b3:\n\ns = v\u00b3 / sqrt(3)\n\nSubstitute into u\u00b3:\n\nu\u00b3 =1 - v\u00b3 / sqrt(3)\n\nSo, u\u00b3 + v\u00b3 / sqrt(3) =1\n\nBut we also have u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 =2^{2/3}\n\nThis system might be difficult to solve. Alternatively, let's assume that the point C is the tangency point, so in addition to lying on AB and the astroid, the derivative of the astroid at C must be equal to the slope of AB.\n\nFirst, compute the slope of AB. AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 -1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3)\n\nSo, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). Therefore, the tangent to the astroid at point C must also have slope -sqrt(3).\n\nNow, the astroid is given by x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1. To find the derivative at a point (x, y) on the astroid, we can implicitly differentiate:\n\n(2/3)x^{-1/3} + (2/3)y^{-1/3} dy/dx =0\n\nTherefore,\n\ndy/dx = - (x^{-1/3}) / (y^{-1/3}) = - (y^{1/3}) / (x^{1/3})\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at (x, y) is - (y^{1/3}) / (x^{1/3})\n\nWe need this slope to be equal to -sqrt(3). Therefore:\n\n- (y^{1/3}) / (x^{1/3}) = -sqrt(3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y^{1/3}) / (x^{1/3}) = sqrt(3)\n\nRaise both sides to the power of 3:\n\ny / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3 sqrt(3)\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = 3 sqrt(3) x\n\nSo, the point C lies on the line y =3 sqrt(3) x. But C is also on AB, whose equation is sqrt(3) x + y = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, solving the system:\n\ny =3 sqrt(3) x\n\nsqrt(3) x + y = sqrt(3)/2\n\nSubstitute y from the first equation into the second:\n\nsqrt(3) x + 3 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(3):\n\n4x =1/2\n\nTherefore,\n\nx=1/8\n\nThen, y=3 sqrt(3) * (1/8)= 3 sqrt(3)/8\n\nSo, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8)\n\nBut wait, let's check if this point lies on AB. AB is parametrized as x=(1 - t)/2, y=(sqrt(3)/2) t. Let's see if there exists t such that (1 - t)/2 =1/8 and (sqrt(3)/2) t=3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nFrom x=(1 - t)/2=1/8:\n\n1 - t=1/4 => t=3/4\n\nThen, y=(sqrt(3)/2)*(3/4)= 3 sqrt(3)/8, which matches. So, t=3/4, and the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). Therefore, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/8)^2 =1/64\n\n(3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=9*3 /64=27/64\n\nSum:1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16\n\nTherefore, OC\u00b2=7/16, so p=7, q=16, p + q=23.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that C is on AB, distinct from A and B. Our point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8), which is between A=(1/2,0) and B=(0, sqrt(3)/2), so t=3/4, which is between 0 and1, so yes, distinct from A and B.\n\nBut we need to verify that this point C is not on any other segment from F except AB. According to our earlier reasoning, since C is the point of tangency of AB with the astroid envelope, it should lie only on AB and no other PQ from F. Because the astroid is the envelope, each PQ is tangent to the astroid at exactly one point, and that point is unique to each PQ. Therefore, the point C, being on the astroid and on AB, is only on AB and no other PQ. Therefore, this should be the unique point C.\n\nTherefore, OC\u00b2=7/16, so the answer is 7 +16=23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}"

Let's denote this as equation (1):\n\nq(1 - t) + p sqrt(3) t = 2pq\n\nEquation (2):\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nWe need to solve this system for p and q, given t, and find t such that the only solution is p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, for a given t, the system may have multiple solutions (p, q). We need to find t such that the system has only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, for such t, the equations must be satisfied only by that p and q.\n\nSo, perhaps we can express q from equation (1) in terms of p, substitute into equation (2), and then set the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation to zero, so that there's only one solution. Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nq(1 - t) + p sqrt(3) t = 2pq\n\nLet's rearrange terms:\n\nq(1 - t) - 2pq + p sqrt(3) t = 0\n\nFactor q:\n\nq(1 - t - 2p) + p sqrt(3) t = 0\n\nSolve for q:\n\nq = [ - p sqrt(3) t ] / (1 - t - 2p )\n\nNow substitute this into equation (2):\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nSo:\n\np\u00b2 + [ ( - p sqrt(3) t ) / (1 - t - 2p ) ]\u00b2 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\np\u00b2 + ( 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 ) / (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2 = 1\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2:\n\np\u00b2 (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2\n\nLet me denote D = 1 - t - 2p. Then:\n\np\u00b2 D\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = D\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\np\u00b2 D\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 - D\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor D\u00b2:\n\nD\u00b2 (p\u00b2 - 1) + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nBut D = 1 - t - 2p, so substitute back:\n\n(1 - t - 2p )\u00b2 (p\u00b2 - 1) + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe expanding everything would help, but it might get messy. Let's try expanding step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (1 - t - 2p )\u00b2:\n\n= (1 - t)^2 - 4p(1 - t) + 4p\u00b2\n\n= 1 - 2t + t\u00b2 - 4p + 4pt + 4p\u00b2\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n[1 - 2t + t\u00b2 - 4p + 4pt + 4p\u00b2] (p\u00b2 - 1) + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nNow, multiply each term inside the brackets by (p\u00b2 - 1):\n\n(1 - 2t + t\u00b2)(p\u00b2 - 1) - 4p(p\u00b2 - 1) + 4pt(p\u00b2 - 1) + 4p\u00b2(p\u00b2 - 1) + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Let's compute each term separately.\n\nFirst term: (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)(p\u00b2 - 1) = (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)p\u00b2 - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: -4p(p\u00b2 - 1) = -4p\u00b3 + 4p\n\nThird term: 4pt(p\u00b2 - 1) = 4p\u00b3 t - 4p t\n\nFourth term: 4p\u00b2(p\u00b2 - 1) = 4p\u2074 - 4p\u00b2\n\nFifth term: 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n(1 - 2t + t\u00b2)p\u00b2 - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) -4p\u00b3 + 4p + 4p\u00b3 t - 4p t + 4p\u2074 - 4p\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2 = 0\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n- Terms with p\u2074: 4p\u2074\n\n- Terms with p\u00b3: -4p\u00b3 + 4p\u00b3 t\n\n- Terms with p\u00b2: (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)p\u00b2 -4p\u00b2 + 3 p\u00b2 t\u00b2\n\n- Terms with p: 4p -4p t\n\n- Constant term: - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)\n\nSo:\n\n4p\u2074 + (-4 + 4t)p\u00b3 + [ (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) -4 + 3 t\u00b2 ]p\u00b2 + (4 -4t)p - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) = 0\n\nSimplify each coefficient:\n\nFor p\u2074: 4\n\nFor p\u00b3: 4(t - 1)\n\nFor p\u00b2: (1 - 2t + t\u00b2 -4 + 3t\u00b2) = (1 -4) + (-2t) + (t\u00b2 + 3t\u00b2) = -3 -2t +4t\u00b2\n\nFor p: 4(1 - t)\n\nConstant term: - (1 - 2t + t\u00b2)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n4p\u2074 + 4(t -1)p\u00b3 + (-3 -2t +4t\u00b2)p\u00b2 +4(1 - t)p - (1 -2t + t\u00b2) =0\n\nThis is a quartic equation in p. Solving this quartic equation seems very complicated. Maybe there's a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we are looking for t such that the only solution is p =1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2, perhaps substituting p =1/2 into the equation and solving for t would give the required condition.
