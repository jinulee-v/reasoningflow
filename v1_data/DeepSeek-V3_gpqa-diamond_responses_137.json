        "question": "A chemical reaction for the synthesis of a product containing H+ ion was proceeding at room temperature and pH 1.  Accidentally an unknown substance was fallen into the running reaction making the rate of the reaction slower for the product formation and the container got hot due to an exothermic reaction. The pH value of the solution changed to 4 after this accidental addition. What can be the possible reason for changing the rate of reaction?\nA. The increased pH of the solution\nB. The increased temperature of the solution\nC. The increased volume of the solution\nD. The increased pressure of the solution",
        "response": "The correct answer is **A. The increased pH of the solution**.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Effect of pH on the reaction rate**:  \n   The reaction was initially proceeding at pH 1, which is highly acidic. The accidental addition of the unknown substance increased the pH to 4, making the solution less acidic. Since the product contains H\u207a ions, the reaction rate is likely dependent on the concentration of H\u207a ions. A higher pH (lower H\u207a concentration) would slow down the reaction rate.\n\n2. **Temperature increase**:  \n   The container got hot due to an exothermic reaction caused by the unknown substance. While increased temperature generally speeds up reaction rates, in this case, the primary factor slowing the reaction is the change in pH, not the temperature.\n\n3. **Volume and pressure**:  \n   There is no indication that the volume or pressure of the solution changed significantly, so these factors are unlikely to be responsible for the slower reaction rate.\n\nThus, the most plausible reason for the slower reaction rate is the **increased pH of the solution**."
