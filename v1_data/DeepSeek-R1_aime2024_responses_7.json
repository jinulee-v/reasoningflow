        "question": "Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers $(a,b,c)$ satisfying $a + b + c = 300$ and \\[a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000.\\]",
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers that satisfy two conditions: first, their sum a + b + c is 300, and second, the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let's start by understanding what each part means and how they might relate.\n\nFirst, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear Diophantine equation, and the number of nonnegative integer solutions is a standard stars and bars problem. The formula for the number of solutions is C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2) = (302*301)/2 = 45,551. But that's just the total number of triples without considering the second condition. So, the real challenge is incorporating the second equation.\n\nLooking at the second equation: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can factor or simplify this expression. Notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. For example, a\u00b2b and a\u00b2c both have a squared, multiplied by another variable. Similarly for the others. Let me group terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c)\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c)\nAnd c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nSo, the entire expression can be written as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nThat's a bit simpler. Now, since a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let's try that substitution:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me write that as:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nNow, maybe I can relate this to the sum a + b + c = 300. Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. Then, we know that in terms of symmetric sums:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 300\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q\n\nSimilarly, a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 can be expressed using the identity:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3S Q + 3P\n\nSo, substituting S = 300:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = 300\u00b3 - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the original equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nReplace a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 with 90,000 - 2Q:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n300*90,000 = 27,000,000\n\n300*(-2Q) = -600Q\n\nSo, left side becomes:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600Q + 900Q) - 3P = 6,000,000\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n300Q - 3P = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nSo, we have:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nBut Q is ab + bc + ca, and P is abc. So, this equation relates the pairwise products and the triple product. Interesting. So, we have:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, and a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So, perhaps we can express this equation in terms of variables and try to find possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider substituting variables. Let me think. Let me denote variables x = a, y = b, z = c. Then, x + y + z = 300, and 100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can fix one variable and express the others in terms of it. For example, since x + y + z = 300, we can let z = 300 - x - y. Then substitute into the equation:\n\n100(xy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y)) - x y (300 - x - y) = 2,000,000\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, compute xy + yz + zx:\n\nxy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y) = xy + 300y - xy - y\u00b2 + 300x - x\u00b2 - xy\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nxy + y z + z x = xy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y)\n\nFirst term: xy\n\nSecond term: y(300 - x - y) = 300y - xy - y\u00b2\n\nThird term: x(300 - x - y) = 300x - x\u00b2 - xy\n\nSo, adding all three terms:\n\nxy + (300y - xy - y\u00b2) + (300x - x\u00b2 - xy) =\n\nxy + 300y - xy - y\u00b2 + 300x - x\u00b2 - xy\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nxy - xy - xy = -xy\n\n300y + 300x = 300(x + y)\n\n-y\u00b2 - x\u00b2\n\nSo, total is:\n\n300(x + y) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 - xy\n\nTherefore, Q = xy + yz + zx = 300(x + y) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 - xy\n\nThen, substituting into the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, where P = xyz = x y (300 - x - y):\n\nSo,\n\n100[300(x + y) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 - xy] - x y (300 - x - y) = 2,000,000\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n100*300(x + y) - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 - 100xy - 300xy + x\u00b2 y + x y\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nWait, hold on. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 100*300(x + y) = 30,000(x + y)\n\nSecond term: -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy\n\nThird term: - x y (300 - x - y) = -300xy + x\u00b2 y + x y\u00b2\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\n30,000(x + y) -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy -300xy + x\u00b2 y + x y\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n30,000x + 30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 - (100xy + 300xy) + x\u00b2 y + x y\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nWhich is:\n\n30,000x + 30,000y -100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -400xy + x\u00b2 y + x y\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nHmm, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assuming symmetry. Suppose two variables are equal. For example, maybe a = b = c. But since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Let's check if that satisfies the second equation.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. If a = b = c = 100, then each term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Hey, that's exactly the value we need! So, (100, 100, 100) is a solution. But are there other solutions?\n\nWait, but the problem asks for triples of nonnegative integers. So, permutations of (100, 100, 100) would be the same, but since all are equal, there's only one such triple. However, maybe there are other triples where variables are not equal but still satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, but let's check if other permutations could work. Suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Let's see.\n\nLet a = b = k, then c = 300 - 2k. Then, substitute into the equation:\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nSince a = b = k, c = 300 - 2k.\n\nSo, each term:\n\na\u00b2b = k\u00b2 * k = k\u00b3\n\na\u00b2c = k\u00b2 * (300 - 2k)\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a = k\u00b3\n\nb\u00b2c = k\u00b2 * (300 - 2k)\n\nc\u00b2a = (300 - 2k)^2 * k\n\nc\u00b2b = (300 - 2k)^2 * k\n\nSo, total sum:\n\n2k\u00b3 + 2k\u00b2(300 - 2k) + 2k(300 - 2k)^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n2k\u00b3 + 600k\u00b2 - 4k\u00b3 + 2k(90000 - 1200k + 4k\u00b2)\n\n= (2k\u00b3 - 4k\u00b3) + 600k\u00b2 + 2k(90000 - 1200k + 4k\u00b2)\n\n= -2k\u00b3 + 600k\u00b2 + 180,000k - 2,400k\u00b2 + 8k\u00b3\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-2k\u00b3 + 8k\u00b3) + (600k\u00b2 - 2,400k\u00b2) + 180,000k\n\n= 6k\u00b3 - 1,800k\u00b2 + 180,000k\n\nSet this equal to 6,000,000:\n\n6k\u00b3 - 1,800k\u00b2 + 180,000k = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 6:\n\nk\u00b3 - 300k\u00b2 + 30,000k = 1,000,000\n\nBring 1,000,000 to the left:\n\nk\u00b3 - 300k\u00b2 + 30,000k - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nLet me try to factor this equation. Maybe rational roots? Possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1. So possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000. Let's test k = 100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*100\u00b2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nYes, k = 100 is a root. So, factor out (k - 100):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide k\u00b3 - 300k\u00b2 + 30,000k - 1,000,000 by (k - 100).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1  -300   30,000  -1,000,000\n\nMultiply 100 by 1 = 100, add to -300: -200\n\nMultiply 100 by -200 = -20,000, add to 30,000: 10,000\n\nMultiply 100 by 10,000 = 1,000,000, add to -1,000,000: 0\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (k - 100)(k\u00b2 - 200k + 10,000)\n\nNow, set k\u00b2 - 200k + 10,000 = 0\n\nDiscriminant: 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So, double root at k = (200)/2 = 100. So, the polynomial is (k - 100)^3. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier division. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the quadratic factor is k\u00b2 - 200k + 10,000. Let's check discriminant:\n\nD = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So, indeed, it's a perfect square: (k - 100)^2. Therefore, the original polynomial factors as (k - 100)^3. Therefore, the equation (k - 100)^3 = 0, so the only solution is k = 100. Therefore, when a = b, the only solution is a = b = 100, c = 100. So, same as the symmetric solution.\n\nTherefore, if we assume two variables are equal, the only solution is the symmetric one. But maybe there are solutions where all variables are distinct. Let's check.\n\nSuppose a, b, c are distinct. How can we approach this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, where Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc, with a + b + c = 300.\n\nLet me think if there's a substitution or method to solve this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Vieta's formula. If we treat a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. Let me recall that if a, b, c are roots of x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0, where S = a + b + c, Q = ab + bc + ca, P = abc. So, in our case, the cubic equation would be x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0. But we have the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, so P = 100Q - 2,000,000. Therefore, substituting into the cubic equation:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nFactor Q terms:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps express Q in terms of S and the squares.\n\nWait, earlier we had:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q\n\nBut we also had:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich led us to 100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nAlternatively, maybe express a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of S, Q, P:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nBut S = 300, so:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (27,000,000 - 3*300*Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000\n\nBut we already did this earlier, leading to 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of Q:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2Q\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich again gives 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000 => 100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nSo, perhaps we need another equation to relate Q and P. But since we have S, Q, P related through Vieta's formulas, but unless we have more information, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider specific cases where one variable is zero. Let's see.\n\nCase 1: Suppose c = 0. Then, a + b = 300, and the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0 + 0 = a\u00b2b + b\u00b2a = 6,000,000\n\nSo, ab(a + b) = 6,000,000. But a + b = 300, so ab*300 = 6,000,000 => ab = 20,000\n\nSo, we need a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Solving for a and b:\n\nThe quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000\n\nSolutions: [300 \u00b1 100]/2 => 400/2 = 200 or 200/2 = 100\n\nSo, (a, b) = (200, 100) or (100, 200). Therefore, triples are (200, 100, 0) and permutations. Since c = 0, the permutations would be (200, 100, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 200, 0), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). So, 6 permutations.\n\nBut wait, in this case, c = 0, so the triples are (a, b, 0) where a and b are 200 and 100. So, each permutation where 0 can be in any position. So, 3! / 1! = 6 permutations. So, 6 solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: Similarly, suppose a = 0. Then, b + c = 300, and similar equation:\n\n0 + 0 + b\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2*0 + c\u00b2b = b\u00b2c + c\u00b2b = bc(b + c) = 6,000,000\n\nAgain, bc*300 = 6,000,000 => bc = 20,000. So, same as above, solutions (b, c) = (200, 100) or (100, 200). So, similar permutations: 6 solutions. But wait, this is the same as case 1, just with a different variable set to zero. Similarly, if we set b = 0, same result. So, total solutions where one variable is zero would be 3 cases (a=0, b=0, c=0), each contributing 6 permutations, but actually, no. Wait, if we fix a=0, then the permutations are (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). Similarly for b=0 and c=0. So, each zero case gives 2 permutations? Wait, no. Wait, if a=0, then b and c are 200 and 100, so the triples are (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200). Similarly, for b=0: (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200), and for c=0: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). So, total of 6 solutions where one variable is zero. So, 6 solutions.\n\nBut earlier, when c=0, we had 6 permutations, but actually, no. Wait, if c=0, then a and b are 200 and 100, but since a and b are distinguishable variables, swapping a and b gives different triples. So, (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). Similarly, if a=0, then (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200), and same for b=0. So, total 2 permutations per zero case, times 3 variables, gives 6 solutions. So, 6 solutions where one variable is zero.\n\nCase 3: Now, what if two variables are zero? Suppose a = b = 0. Then c = 300. Then, the equation becomes 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \u2260 6,000,000. So, no solutions here.\n\nCase 4: All variables positive. So, a, b, c \u2265 1. Wait, but the problem states nonnegative integers, so they can be zero. But maybe there are solutions where all variables are positive (i.e., at least 1). Let's check.\n\nSuppose a, b, c \u2265 1. Then, perhaps similar to the symmetric solution (100, 100, 100). But are there others?\n\nWait, let's consider the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000. If we can find Q and P such that this holds, given S = 300.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider substituting variables. Let me set x = a - 100, y = b - 100, z = c - 100. Then, x + y + z = 0. But this might complicate things since variables can be negative. Alternatively, perhaps consider deviations from the symmetric solution.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000 with a + b + c = 300.\n\nLet me try small deviations. Suppose a = 100 + t, b = 100 + t, c = 100 - 2t. Then, check if this satisfies the equation.\n\nFirst, check a + b + c = 100 + t + 100 + t + 100 - 2t = 300. Okay, that works.\n\nCompute Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nab = (100 + t)(100 + t) = (100 + t)^2\n\nbc = (100 + t)(100 - 2t) = 100*100 - 200t + 100t - 2t\u00b2 = 10,000 - 100t - 2t\u00b2\n\nca = (100 + t)(100 - 2t) = same as bc\n\nSo, Q = (100 + t)^2 + 2*(10,000 - 100t - 2t\u00b2)\n\nCompute:\n\n(10,000 + 200t + t\u00b2) + 20,000 - 200t - 4t\u00b2 =\n\n10,000 + 200t + t\u00b2 + 20,000 - 200t - 4t\u00b2 =\n\n30,000 - 3t\u00b2\n\nThen, P = abc = (100 + t)^2*(100 - 2t)\n\nExpand:\n\n(10,000 + 200t + t\u00b2)(100 - 2t) =\n\n10,000*100 - 10,000*2t + 200t*100 - 200t*2t + t\u00b2*100 - t\u00b2*2t =\n\n1,000,000 - 20,000t + 20,000t - 400t\u00b2 + 100t\u00b2 - 2t\u00b3 =\n\n1,000,000 - 300t\u00b2 - 2t\u00b3\n\nNow, compute 100Q - P:\n\n100*(30,000 - 3t\u00b2) - (1,000,000 - 300t\u00b2 - 2t\u00b3) =\n\n3,000,000 - 300t\u00b2 - 1,000,000 + 300t\u00b2 + 2t\u00b3 =\n\n2,000,000 + 2t\u00b3\n\nSet this equal to 2,000,000:\n\n2,000,000 + 2t\u00b3 = 2,000,000 => 2t\u00b3 = 0 => t = 0\n\nSo, the only solution in this case is t = 0, which gives a = b = c = 100. So, no other solutions by this perturbation.\n\nAlternatively, try another perturbation. Suppose a = 100 + t, b = 100 - t, c = 100. Then, a + b + c = 300.\n\nCompute Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nab = (100 + t)(100 - t) = 10,000 - t\u00b2\n\nbc = (100 - t)(100) = 10,000 - 100t\n\nca = (100 + t)(100) = 10,000 + 100t\n\nSo, Q = (10,000 - t\u00b2) + (10,000 - 100t) + (10,000 + 100t) = 30,000 - t\u00b2\n\nP = abc = (100 + t)(100 - t)(100) = (10,000 - t\u00b2)*100 = 1,000,000 - 100t\u00b2\n\nThen, 100Q - P = 100*(30,000 - t\u00b2) - (1,000,000 - 100t\u00b2) = 3,000,000 - 100t\u00b2 - 1,000,000 + 100t\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nSo, regardless of t, this equals 2,000,000. Wait, that's interesting. So, for any t, as long as a = 100 + t, b = 100 - t, c = 100, then 100Q - P = 2,000,000. But we also need a + b + c = 300, which holds here. However, a, b, c must be nonnegative integers. So, t must be an integer such that 100 + t \u2265 0, 100 - t \u2265 0, and c = 100 \u2265 0. So, 100 + t \u2265 0 => t \u2265 -100, and 100 - t \u2265 0 => t \u2264 100. So, t can range from -100 to 100. But t must be an integer. Therefore, t \u2208 {-100, -99, ..., 99, 100}. However, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, t must be integer. Each t gives a distinct triple:\n\n(a, b, c) = (100 + t, 100 - t, 100)\n\nBut since a, b, c are nonnegative, t can be from -100 to 100. However, permutations might come into play here. Wait, but in this case, c is fixed at 100, while a and b vary. However, if we consider all permutations, such triples where two variables are 100 \u00b1 t and the third is 100 can be arranged in different ways.\n\nWait, hold on. Let's see. For example, if we take t = 1, then (101, 99, 100). Similarly, t = -1 gives (99, 101, 100). But these are different triples. However, if we consider all permutations, then each distinct permutation would be counted separately. However, in the problem statement, triples are ordered, so (101, 99, 100), (99, 101, 100), (100, 101, 99), etc., are all distinct solutions.\n\nWait, but in the perturbation above, we fixed c = 100 and varied a and b. But similarly, we could fix a = 100 and vary b and c, or fix b = 100 and vary a and c. So, for each of these, we can generate similar solutions.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose we fix one variable at 100 and let the other two variables be 100 + t and 100 - t. Then, for each variable fixed at 100, t can range from -100 to 100, but ensuring that 100 + t and 100 - t are nonnegative. So, t can be from -100 to 100, but since t must be integer, t \u2208 {-100, -99, ..., 99, 100}. For each fixed variable (either a, b, or c), we get 201 solutions (from t = -100 to t = 100). However, some solutions might overlap when t = 0, which gives the symmetric solution (100, 100, 100). Let's check.\n\nIf we fix a = 100, then the triples are (100, 100 + t, 100 - t). Similarly, fixing b = 100 gives (100 + t, 100, 100 - t), and fixing c = 100 gives (100 + t, 100 - t, 100). Each of these is a distinct set of triples unless t = 0. For t \u2260 0, each choice of fixed variable gives a different triple. For example, t = 1:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 101, 99)\n- Fixing b: (101, 100, 99)\n- Fixing c: (101, 99, 100)\n\nThese are all distinct permutations. However, when t = 0, all three fixings give (100, 100, 100), which is only one triple.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples from this method would be:\n\nFor each of the three variables fixed (a, b, c), we have t from -100 to 100, inclusive. That's 201 values per fixed variable. However, the triple (100, 100, 100) is counted three times (once in each fixed variable), but it should only be counted once. Therefore, total triples would be 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 - 2 = 601? Wait, no. Wait, each t from -100 to 100 gives a unique triple for each fixed variable, except when t = 0, which gives the same triple regardless of which variable is fixed. Wait, actually, no. When t = 0, fixing any variable gives (100, 100, 100). So, in each fixed variable case, t = 0 gives the same triple. Therefore, total number of distinct triples would be:\n\nFor each fixed variable:\n\n- t from -100 to -1: 100 values, each giving a unique triple not overlapping with other fixed variables\n- t from 1 to 100: 100 values, each giving a unique triple not overlapping with other fixed variables\n- t = 0: 1 value, same across all fixed variables\n\nTherefore, total triples:\n\n3*(100 + 100) + 1 = 3*200 + 1 = 600 + 1 = 601\n\nBut wait, let's verify with an example. For t = 1:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 101, 99)\n- Fixing b: (101, 100, 99)\n- Fixing c: (101, 99, 100)\n\nThese are three distinct triples. Similarly, for t = -1:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 99, 101)\n- Fixing b: (99, 100, 101)\n- Fixing c: (99, 101, 100)\n\nAgain, three distinct triples. For each t \u2260 0, we get three distinct triples. For t = 0, only one triple. Therefore, total number of triples is 3*200 + 1 = 601.\n\nBut wait, t ranges from -100 to 100, inclusive. That's 201 values. For each fixed variable, t = -100 to 100 gives 201 triples. However, overlapping only at t = 0. Wait, no. Wait, if we fix a variable, say a = 100, then t ranges from -100 to 100, giving 201 triples: (100, 100 + t, 100 - t). Similarly for fixing b and c. However, when t = 0, all three fixed variables give the same triple. But for other t, each fixed variable gives a different triple.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples would be 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 - 2 = 601. Because the triple (100, 100, 100) is counted three times in the 3*201 count, so we subtract 2 to get the correct count of 1.\n\nTherefore, these perturbations give us 601 solutions. However, earlier we found 6 solutions where one variable is zero. Wait, but are these perturbations including the all-100 case and the cases where variables are zero?\n\nWait, no. Because in the perturbation where we fix one variable at 100 and vary the other two, we require that the varied variables are 100 \u00b1 t. If t = 100, then one variable becomes 200 and the other becomes 0. For example, fixing a = 100, t = 100 gives (100, 200, 0). Similarly, t = -100 gives (100, 0, 200). So, these cases where one variable is zero are included in the perturbation method. Therefore, the 601 solutions include the 6 solutions with one zero variable and the symmetric solution (100, 100, 100). Wait, but hold on:\n\nWait, when we fix a variable at 100 and set t = 100, we get triples like (100, 200, 0). Similarly, t = -100 gives (100, 0, 200). So, for each fixed variable, t = 100 and t = -100 give triples where one variable is zero. Since there are three fixed variables, each contributing two such triples (t = \u00b1100), but actually:\n\nWait, fixing a = 100:\n\n- t = 100: (100, 200, 0)\n- t = -100: (100, 0, 200)\n\nSimilarly, fixing b = 100:\n\n- t = 100: (200, 100, 0)\n- t = -100: (0, 100, 200)\n\nFixing c = 100:\n\n- t = 100: (200, 0, 100)\n- t = -100: (0, 200, 100)\n\nSo, total of 6 triples where one variable is zero, which matches our earlier finding. Therefore, the 601 solutions include:\n\n- 1 triple where all variables are 100\n- 6 triples where one variable is zero\n- 601 - 1 - 6 = 594 triples where all variables are positive and not all equal\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, 3 fixed variables, each with t from -100 to 100 (201 values). For each fixed variable:\n\n- t = 0: (100, 100, 100)\n- t = \u00b1100: two triples with a zero\n- t from -99 to -1 and 1 to 99: 198 values, each giving triples with all variables positive and not all equal\n\nTherefore, per fixed variable:\n\n- 1 (t=0) + 2 (t=\u00b1100) + 198 (other t) = 201\n\nTotal across three fixed variables:\n\n- 3*1 = 3 (but only 1 unique triple for t=0)\n- 3*2 = 6 (unique triples with a zero)\n- 3*198 = 594 (unique triples with all variables positive and not all equal)\n\nBut when we count all three fixed variables, the t from -99 to -1 and 1 to 99 for each fixed variable give unique triples. For example, t=1 in fixed a gives (100, 101, 99), t=1 in fixed b gives (101, 100, 99), t=1 in fixed c gives (101, 99, 100). So, each t \u2260 0, \u00b1100 in each fixed variable gives a distinct triple. Therefore, total triples are:\n\n1 (all 100s) + 6 (with a zero) + 594 (all positive and distinct) = 601\n\nTherefore, total solutions found so far are 601. But wait, earlier when we considered the case where one variable is zero, we found 6 solutions, which are included in these 601. The symmetric solution is 1, included as well. So, are there any other solutions outside of these?\n\nWait, suppose there exists a solution where none of the variables is 100 and none is zero. For example, a = 101, b = 101, c = 98. Then, a + b + c = 300. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\na = 101, b = 101, c = 98\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = 101\u00b2*101 = 101\u00b3\n\na\u00b2c = 101\u00b2*98\n\nb\u00b2a = 101\u00b2*101 = same as a\u00b2b\n\nb\u00b2c = 101\u00b2*98\n\nc\u00b2a = 98\u00b2*101\n\nc\u00b2b = 98\u00b2*101\n\nSo, total sum:\n\n2*101\u00b3 + 2*101\u00b2*98 + 2*98\u00b2*101\n\nFactor out 2*101:\n\n2*101*(101\u00b2 + 101*98 + 98\u00b2)\n\nCompute inside the parentheses:\n\n101\u00b2 + 101*98 + 98\u00b2\n\n= (101\u00b2 + 98\u00b2) + 101*98\n\nCalculate 101\u00b2 = 10,201, 98\u00b2 = 9,604, 101*98 = 9,898\n\nSo, total inside: 10,201 + 9,604 + 9,898 = 29,703\n\nTherefore, total sum: 2*101*29,703 = 202*29,703\n\nCalculate 200*29,703 = 5,940,600\n\n2*29,703 = 59,406\n\nTotal: 5,940,600 + 59,406 = 6,000,006\n\nWait, that's 6,000,006, which is 6 more than 6,000,000. So, this does not satisfy the equation. Close, but not quite. So, this triple is not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another example. Let me try a = 102, b = 99, c = 99. Then, a + b + c = 300.\n\nCompute the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 102\u00b2*99 + 102\u00b2*99 + 99\u00b2*102 + 99\u00b2*99 + 99\u00b2*102 + 99\u00b2*99\n\nSimplify:\n\n2*102\u00b2*99 + 2*99\u00b2*102 + 2*99\u00b3\n\nFactor:\n\n2*99*(102\u00b2 + 99*102 + 99\u00b2)\n\nCompute inside:\n\n102\u00b2 + 99*102 + 99\u00b2\n\n= (102\u00b2 + 99\u00b2) + 99*102\n\nCalculate 102\u00b2 = 10,404, 99\u00b2 = 9,801, 99*102 = 10,098\n\nTotal inside: 10,404 + 9,801 + 10,098 = 30,303\n\nTotal sum: 2*99*30,303 = 198*30,303\n\nCalculate 200*30,303 = 6,060,600, subtract 2*30,303 = 60,606: 6,060,600 - 60,606 = 5,999,994\n\nWhich is 6 less than 6,000,000. Again, close but not exact. So, this suggests that perturbing around 100 gives sums close to 6,000,000, but only the exact case when variables are 100 or with one variable zero gives the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no other solutions outside the 601 found earlier. Therefore, perhaps the total number of solutions is 601 + 6? Wait, no, because the 601 already includes the 6 solutions with a zero. Wait, no, earlier calculation showed that the 601 includes 1 symmetric solution, 6 zeros, and 594 others. But when we tested examples outside of these, they didn't work. So, maybe the only solutions are those 601.\n\nBut wait, let's verify with another case. Suppose two variables are equal and the third is different, but not zero. For example, a = b = 101, c = 98. Then, a + b + c = 300. Compute the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 101\u00b2*101 + 101\u00b2*98 + 101\u00b2*101 + 101\u00b2*98 + 98\u00b2*101 + 98\u00b2*101\n\n= 2*101\u00b3 + 2*101\u00b2*98 + 2*98\u00b2*101\n\nFactor out 2*101:\n\n2*101*(101\u00b2 + 101*98 + 98\u00b2)\n\nAs before, this equals 2*101*(10,201 + 9,898 + 9,604) = 2*101*29,703 = 6,000,006, which is over by 6. So, not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, a = 99, b = 99, c = 102. Similar to above, sum would be 6,000,006 - 12 = 5,999,994. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a solution where variables are not near 100. For example, a = 150, b = 150, c = 0. Then, sum is 300, but the equation gives:\n\n150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 0 + 0 = 2*150\u00b3 = 2*3,375,000 = 6,750,000 \u2260 6,000,000. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, a = 50, b = 50, c = 200. Then, compute:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 50\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*200 + 50\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*200 + 200\u00b2*50 + 200\u00b2*50\n\n= 2*50\u00b3 + 2*50\u00b2*200 + 2*200\u00b2*50\n\n= 2*(125,000) + 2*(250,000) + 2*(2,000,000)\n\n= 250,000 + 500,000 + 4,000,000 = 4,750,000 \u2260 6,000,000\n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, a = 120, b = 100, c = 80. Then, compute:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 120\u00b2*100 + 120\u00b2*80 + 100\u00b2*120 + 100\u00b2*80 + 80\u00b2*120 + 80\u00b2*100\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n120\u00b2*100 = 14,400*100 = 1,440,000\n\n120\u00b2*80 = 14,400*80 = 1,152,000\n\n100\u00b2*120 = 10,000*120 = 1,200,000\n\n100\u00b2*80 = 10,000*80 = 800,000\n\n80\u00b2*120 = 6,400*120 = 768,000\n\n80\u00b2*100 = 6,400*100 = 640,000\n\nTotal sum: 1,440,000 + 1,152,000 + 1,200,000 + 800,000 + 768,000 + 640,000\n\nAdd them up:\n\n1,440,000 + 1,152,000 = 2,592,000\n\n2,592,000 + 1,200,000 = 3,792,000\n\n3,792,000 + 800,000 = 4,592,000\n\n4,592,000 + 768,000 = 5,360,000\n\n5,360,000 + 640,000 = 6,000,000\n\nWait, that works! So, this triple (120, 100, 80) satisfies the equation. But according to our previous count, this should be included in the 601 solutions. Let's check.\n\nIf we fix c = 100, then a = 100 + t, b = 100 - t. If t = 20, then a = 120, b = 80, c = 100. So, yes, this is part of the perturbation when we fix c = 100 and t = 20. Therefore, this solution is included in the 601 count.\n\nSimilarly, permutations of this triple, like (120, 80, 100), (100, 120, 80), etc., are also included when we fix different variables. So, indeed, this solution is already accounted for in the 601 solutions.\n\nTherefore, it seems that all solutions are captured by the 601 count, which includes the symmetric solution, the 6 solutions with one zero, and the rest being permutations where one variable is 100 and the other two are 100 \u00b1 t.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with another example. Take a = 110, b = 100, c = 90. Then, check the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 110\u00b2*100 + 110\u00b2*90 + 100\u00b2*110 + 100\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*110 + 90\u00b2*100\n\nCompute each term:\n\n110\u00b2*100 = 12,100*100 = 1,210,000\n\n110\u00b2*90 = 12,100*90 = 1,089,000\n\n100\u00b2*110 = 10,000*110 = 1,100,000\n\n100\u00b2*90 = 10,000*90 = 900,000\n\n90\u00b2*110 = 8,100*110 = 891,000\n\n90\u00b2*100 = 8,100*100 = 810,000\n\nTotal sum: 1,210,000 + 1,089,000 + 1,100,000 + 900,000 + 891,000 + 810,000\n\nAdding up:\n\n1,210,000 + 1,089,000 = 2,299,000\n\n2,299,000 + 1,100,000 = 3,399,000\n\n3,399,000 + 900,000 = 4,299,000\n\n4,299,000 + 891,000 = 5,190,000\n\n5,190,000 + 810,000 = 6,000,000\n\nYes, this also works. And this triple is part of the perturbation when fixing b = 100, t = 10: (110, 100, 90). So, included in the 601 solutions.\n\nTherefore, it seems that all solutions are of the form where one variable is 100, and the other two are 100 \u00b1 t, or permutations thereof, including cases where one variable is zero. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 601.\n\nBut wait, earlier we thought the count was 601, but let's verify the arithmetic.\n\nWhen we fix each variable (a, b, c) and let t range from -100 to 100, that's 201 values per variable. However, when t = 0, all three fixed variables give the same solution (100, 100, 100). For other t, each fixed variable gives a distinct solution. So, total number of solutions is:\n\nFor each fixed variable:\n\n- t = -100 to -1: 100 values, each giving a unique solution\n- t = 1 to 100: 100 values, each giving a unique solution\n- t = 0: 1 value, same across all fixed variables\n\nTherefore, per fixed variable: 200 unique solutions + 1 shared solution.\n\nTotal across three fixed variables: 3*200 + 1 = 601.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 601.\n\nBut wait, earlier we found that when one variable is zero, there are 6 solutions, which are included in these 601. The symmetric solution is 1, and the rest are 601 - 1 - 6 = 594 solutions where all variables are positive and not all equal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. But let's confirm if there are any other solutions outside this set.\n\nSuppose there exists a solution not captured by this perturbation. For example, a = 110, b = 90, c = 100. This is included in the perturbation when fixing c = 100, t = 10. So, yes, it's included.\n\nAnother example: a = 50, b = 150, c = 100. Fixing c = 100, t = -50. So, a = 100 - 50 = 50, b = 100 + 50 = 150. So, included.\n\nWhat about a = 200, b = 50, c = 50. Then, a + b + c = 300. Compute the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 200\u00b2*50 + 200\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*200 + 50\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*200 + 50\u00b2*50\n\n= 2*200\u00b2*50 + 2*50\u00b2*200 + 2*50\u00b3\n\n= 2*4,000,000*50 + 2*2,500*200 + 2*125,000\n\nWait, compute each term:\n\n200\u00b2*50 = 40,000*50 = 2,000,000\n\nSimilarly, the other term same: 2,000,000\n\n50\u00b2*200 = 2,500*200 = 500,000\n\nSimilarly, the other term same: 500,000\n\n50\u00b3 = 125,000\n\nSimilarly, the other term same: 125,000\n\nTotal sum: 2*2,000,000 + 2*500,000 + 2*125,000 = 4,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 250,000 = 5,250,000 \u2260 6,000,000\n\nSo, not a solution. Therefore, this triple is not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, a = 250, b = 25, c = 25. Sum is 300. Compute:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 250\u00b2*25 + 250\u00b2*25 + 25\u00b2*250 + 25\u00b2*25 + 25\u00b2*250 + 25\u00b2*25\n\n= 2*250\u00b2*25 + 2*25\u00b2*250 + 2*25\u00b3\n\nCalculate:\n\n250\u00b2*25 = 62,500*25 = 1,562,500\n\n25\u00b2*250 = 625*250 = 156,250\n\n25\u00b3 = 15,625\n\nTotal sum: 2*1,562,500 + 2*156,250 + 2*15,625 = 3,125,000 + 312,500 + 31,250 = 3,468,750 \u2260 6,000,000\n\nNot a solution.\n\nTherefore, it seems that all solutions are indeed captured by the perturbation method, leading to 601 solutions. However, let's check if the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000 has any other solutions outside of these.\n\nSuppose we have a solution where none of the variables is 100 or zero, and they are not of the form 100 \u00b1 t. For example, a = 101, b = 101, c = 98. As before, this gives a sum exceeding 6,000,000. Similarly, other close numbers either exceed or fall short. Therefore, it's likely that the only solutions are the 601 found.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples is 601. But wait, the problem asks for nonnegative integers, so including the permutations where variables can be zero. But according to our analysis, all solutions are accounted for in the 601 count, which includes the 6 permutations with a zero and the symmetric solution.\n\nBut let me verify once more. The key equation we derived is 100Q - P = 2,000,000, with Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc, given that a + b + c = 300. We found that all solutions are of the form where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, being 100 + t and 100 - t. This includes cases where t = \u00b1100, leading to a zero variable. Therefore, these are all solutions.\n\nHence, the total number of solutions is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me check the arithmetic again. For each fixed variable (a, b, c), t ranges from -100 to 100, which is 201 values. For each fixed variable, this gives 201 ordered triples. However, when we fix different variables, some triples are permutations of each other. For example, fixing a = 100 and t = 1 gives (100, 101, 99), fixing b = 100 and t = 1 gives (101, 100, 99), and fixing c = 100 and t = 1 gives (101, 99, 100). These are three distinct ordered triples. Similarly, for each t \u2260 0, we get three distinct ordered triples. For t = 0, all three fixed variables give the same ordered triple (100, 100, 100). For t = \u00b1100, each fixed variable gives a unique ordered triple with a zero, but these are distinct from each other.\n\nTherefore, total number of ordered triples is:\n\n- For each t from -100 to 100, excluding 0: 200 values\n- For each t, three ordered triples (from fixing each variable)\n- Plus one ordered triple for t = 0\n\nTotal: 200*3 + 1 = 600 + 1 = 601\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the total number of ordered triples is 601.\n\nBut let me confirm with another example. Take t = 50:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 150, 50)\n- Fixing b: (150, 100, 50)\n- Fixing c: (150, 50, 100)\n\nThese are three distinct ordered triples. Similarly, t = -50:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 50, 150)\n- Fixing b: (50, 100, 150)\n- Fixing c: (50, 150, 100)\n\nAgain, three distinct ordered triples. Each t \u2260 0 gives three ordered triples, and t = 0 gives one. Therefore, total is 3*200 + 1 = 601.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. However, the problem statement says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", which are ordered, so this count is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other solutions outside this set. Suppose we have a solution where two variables are equal and the third is different, but not related to 100. For example, a = b = 150, c = 0. But we already saw that this gives a sum of 6,750,000, which is too high. Similarly, a = b = 50, c = 200 gives a sum of 4,750,000, which is too low. So, no solutions there.\n\nAlternatively, a = 90, b = 90, c = 120. Compute:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 120\u00b2*90 + 120\u00b2*90\n\n= 2*90\u00b3 + 2*90\u00b2*120 + 2*120\u00b2*90\n\nCalculate:\n\n90\u00b3 = 729,000\n\n90\u00b2*120 = 8,100*120 = 972,000\n\n120\u00b2*90 = 14,400*90 = 1,296,000\n\nTotal sum: 2*729,000 + 2*972,000 + 2*1,296,000 = 1,458,000 + 1,944,000 + 2,592,000 = 6,000,000\n\nWait, this works! So, (90, 90, 120) is a solution. But according to our previous count, this should be included. Let's see.\n\nIf we fix c = 120, then a and b would need to be 100 \u00b1 t. Wait, but 90 and 90 don't fit that form. Wait, unless t is negative. Wait, if we fix c = 100, then a = 100 + t, b = 100 - t. But in this case, c = 120, which is different. So, this solution is not captured by our previous perturbation method.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So, there exists a solution not captured by the previous method. Therefore, our earlier conclusion that all solutions are of the form with one variable fixed at 100 is incorrect.\n\nSo, this suggests that there are other solutions outside the 601 count. Therefore, our previous approach missed some solutions.\n\nLet's analyze this new solution: a = 90, b = 90, c = 120. Check a + b + c = 300. Yes. Compute the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 120\u00b2*90 + 120\u00b2*90\n\n= 2*90\u00b3 + 2*90\u00b2*120 + 2*120\u00b2*90\n\n= 2*729,000 + 2*972,000 + 2*1,296,000\n\n= 1,458,000 + 1,944,000 + 2,592,000\n\n= 6,000,000\n\nYes, correct. So, this triple is a valid solution. But it's not of the form where one variable is 100 and the other two are 100 \u00b1 t. Therefore, our previous count of 601 is incomplete.\n\nThis means there are solutions outside the perturbation around 100. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nLet me think. The equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, with Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc, and a + b + c = 300.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation as:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can set two variables equal and solve.\n\nLet me assume a = b. Then, c = 300 - 2a.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\n\nSince a = b, c = 300 - 2a:\n\na*a*(300 - 2a) = 100(a*a + a*(300 - 2a) + a*(300 - 2a)) - 2,000,000\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2(300 - 2a) = 100(a\u00b2 + 2a(300 - 2a)) - 2,000,000\n\nCompute right side:\n\n100(a\u00b2 + 600a - 4a\u00b2) = 100(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a\n\nLeft side:\n\n300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3\n\nEquation:\n\n300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3 = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3 + 300a\u00b2 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(300a\u00b2 + 300a\u00b2) - 2a\u00b3 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0\n\n600a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - 30,000a + 1,000,000 = 0\n\nRearrange:\n\n-a\u00b3 + 300a\u00b2 - 30,000a + 1,000,000 = 0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nThis is the same cubic equation as before when we set two variables equal. Earlier, we found that a = 100 is a root. Let's factor it:\n\n(a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0\n\nWhich factors further as (a - 100)^3 = 0. Therefore, the only solution is a = 100. Therefore, when a = b, the only solution is a = b = 100, c = 100. So, the symmetric solution.\n\nBut wait, in our example earlier, a = b = 90, c = 120 is a solution. But according to this, setting a = b leads only to the symmetric solution. Therefore, this suggests that the solution a = b = 90, c = 120 is not captured by setting a = b. Therefore, there must be solutions where all three variables are distinct.\n\nThis indicates that our initial approach missed solutions where variables are not perturbations of 100 or zero. Therefore, we need a different method.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the original equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWe can factor this as:\n\nab(a + c) + bc(b + a) + ca(c + b) = 6,000,000\n\nBut not sure if helpful. Alternatively, note that:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) - 3abc\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a + ca\u00b2\n\nWhich is the same as the original expression plus 3abc. Therefore:\n\nOriginal expression = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) - 3abc\n\nBut not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, recall that we have:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nWhere Q = ab + bc + ca, P = abc, and a + b + c = 300.\n\nLet me think of this as an equation in variables a, b, c. Maybe we can use substitution.\n\nLet me denote two variables, say, x = a, y = b, then c = 300 - x - y.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n100(xy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y)) - x y (300 - x - y) = 2,000,000\n\nThis is similar to what I did earlier. Let's compute Q and P:\n\nQ = xy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y) = 300(x + y) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 - xy\n\nP = xy(300 - x - y)\n\nSo, equation:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nSubstitute Q and P:\n\n100[300(x + y) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 - xy] - xy(300 - x - y) = 2,000,000\n\nExpand:\n\n30,000(x + y) - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 - 100xy - 300xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n30,000x + 30,000y - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 - 400xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nThis is a diophantine equation in two variables x and y, with x, y \u2265 0 and x + y \u2264 300.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can look for integer solutions where x and y are such that x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 - 400xy - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 + 30,000x + 30,000y = 2,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, factor terms:\n\nxy(x + y) - 400xy - 100(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + 30,000(x + y) = 2,000,000\n\nBut x + y = 300 - z, where z = c. But z = 300 - x - y, so x + y = 300 - z. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that x and y are positive integers less than 300. This equation might have solutions other than the ones we found earlier. For example, the solution (90, 90, 120):\n\nPlugging x = 90, y = 90:\n\nLeft side:\n\n30,000*90 + 30,000*90 - 100*90\u00b2 - 100*90\u00b2 - 400*90*90 + 90\u00b2*90 + 90*90\u00b2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n30,000*90 = 2,700,000\n\n30,000*90 = 2,700,000\n\n-100*90\u00b2 = -100*8,100 = -810,000\n\n-100*90\u00b2 = -810,000\n\n-400*90*90 = -400*8,100 = -3,240,000\n\n90\u00b2*90 = 729,000\n\n90*90\u00b2 = 729,000\n\nTotal sum:\n\n2,700,000 + 2,700,000 - 810,000 - 810,000 - 3,240,000 + 729,000 + 729,000\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n2,700,000 + 2,700,000 = 5,400,000\n\n5,400,000 - 810,000 - 810,000 = 5,400,000 - 1,620,000 = 3,780,000\n\n3,780,000 - 3,240,000 = 540,000\n\n540,000 + 729,000 + 729,000 = 540,000 + 1,458,000 = 1,998,000\n\nWait, but this is supposed to be 2,000,000. There's a discrepancy of 2,000. Did I compute something wrong?\n\nWait, let's recompute:\n\nFor x = 90, y = 90:\n\n30,000x + 30,000y = 30,000*90 + 30,000*90 = 2,700,000 + 2,700,000 = 5,400,000\n\n-100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 = -100*(90\u00b2 + 90\u00b2) = -100*(8,100 + 8,100) = -100*16,200 = -1,620,000\n\n-400xy = -400*90*90 = -400*8,100 = -3,240,000\n\nx\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 90\u00b2*90 + 90*90\u00b2 = 729,000 + 729,000 = 1,458,000\n\nTotal sum: 5,400,000 - 1,620,000 - 3,240,000 + 1,458,000 =\n\n5,400,000 - 1,620,000 = 3,780,000\n\n3,780,000 - 3,240,000 = 540,000\n\n540,000 + 1,458,000 = 1,998,000\n\nBut the equation requires this to be 2,000,000. So, discrepancy of 2,000. However, we know that (90, 90, 120) is a solution. Therefore, there must be an error in the substitution or calculation.\n\nWait, no. The equation we derived is:\n\n30,000x + 30,000y - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 - 400xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nBut when we plug in x = 90, y = 90, we get 1,998,000, which is 2,000 less than required. However, when we computed the original expression for (90, 90, 120), we got 6,000,000. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the substitution process.\n\nWait, let's go back. The original equation after substitution was:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nWhere Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.\n\nFor (90, 90, 120):\n\nQ = 90*90 + 90*120 + 90*120 = 8,100 + 10,800 + 10,800 = 29,700\n\nP = 90*90*120 = 972,000\n\nThen, 100Q - P = 100*29,700 - 972,000 = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier calculation where the sum was 6,000,000. There's a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000 was derived from the original equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nBut when we computed the sum for (90, 90, 120), we got 6,000,000, but according to 100Q - P, we get 1,998,000 \u2260 2,000,000. This inconsistency suggests an error in the derivation.\n\nWait, let's re-derive the equation step by step.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWe rewrote this as:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nThen, using identities:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nCompute:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n300Q - 3P = 6,000,000 => 100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nThis derivation seems correct. Therefore, if (90, 90, 120) satisfies the original equation, then 100Q - P must equal 2,000,000. But according to Q = 29,700 and P = 972,000:\n\n100Q - P = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000 \u2260 2,000,000\n\nThis contradiction implies that there's an error in our calculations. Wait, let's recompute Q and P for (90, 90, 120):\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca = 90*90 + 90*120 + 90*120 = 8,100 + 10,800 + 10,800 = 29,700\n\nP = abc = 90*90*120 = 972,000\n\n100Q - P = 100*29,700 - 972,000 = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000\n\nBut according to the original equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWhich we computed earlier as 6,000,000. Therefore, there's a contradiction, meaning our derivation of 100Q - P = 2,000,000 is incorrect.\n\nWait, this is a serious issue. Let's re-examine the derivation.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWe rewrote this as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b) = 6,000,000\n\nThen, since a + b + c = 300, we substituted:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich expands to:\n\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000\n\nFactor:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nThis step is correct.\n\nThen, using the identities:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 300\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P = 300\u00b3 - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nCompute:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q"

            "text": "Therefore, if we assume two variables are equal, the only solution is the symmetric one. But maybe there are solutions where all variables are distinct. Let's check.\n\nSuppose a, b, c are distinct. How can we approach this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, where Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc, with a + b + c = 300.\n\nLet me think if there's a substitution or method to solve this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Vieta's formula. If we treat a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. Let me recall that if a, b, c are roots of x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0, where S = a + b + c, Q = ab + bc + ca, P = abc. So, in our case, the cubic equation would be x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0. But we have the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, so P = 100Q - 2,000,000. Therefore, substituting into the cubic equation:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nFactor Q terms:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps express Q in terms of S and the squares.\n\nWait, earlier we had:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q\n\nBut we also had:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich led us to 100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nAlternatively, maybe express a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 in terms of S, Q, P:\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nBut S = 300, so:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (27,000,000 - 3*300*Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000\n\nBut we already did this earlier, leading to 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of Q:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 90,000 - 2Q\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich again gives 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000 => 100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nSo, perhaps we need another equation to relate Q and P. But since we have S, Q, P related through Vieta's formulas, but unless we have more information, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider specific cases where one variable is zero. Let's see.\n\nCase 1: Suppose c = 0. Then, a + b = 300, and the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0 + 0 = a\u00b2b + b\u00b2a = 6,000,000\n\nSo, ab(a + b) = 6,000,000. But a + b = 300, so ab*300 = 6,000,000 => ab = 20,000\n\nSo, we need a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Solving for a and b:\n\nThe quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000\n\nSolutions: [300 \u00b1 100]/2 => 400/2 = 200 or 200/2 = 100\n\nSo, (a, b) = (200, 100) or (100, 200). Therefore, triples are (200, 100, 0) and permutations. Since c = 0, the permutations would be (200, 100, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 200, 0), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). So, 6 permutations.\n\nBut wait, in this case, c = 0, so the triples are (a, b, 0) where a and b are 200 and 100. So, each permutation where 0 can be in any position. So, 3! / 1! = 6 permutations. So, 6 solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: Similarly, suppose a = 0. Then, b + c = 300, and similar equation:\n\n0 + 0 + b\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2*0 + c\u00b2b = b\u00b2c + c\u00b2b = bc(b + c) = 6,000,000\n\nAgain, bc*300 = 6,000,000 => bc = 20,000. So, same as above, solutions (b, c) = (200, 100) or (100, 200). So, similar permutations: 6 solutions. But wait, this is the same as case 1, just with a different variable set to zero. Similarly, if we set b = 0, same result. So, total solutions where one variable is zero would be 3 cases (a=0, b=0, c=0), each contributing 6 permutations, but actually, no. Wait, if we fix a=0, then the permutations are (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). Similarly for b=0 and c=0. So, each zero case gives 2 permutations? Wait, no. Wait, if a=0, then b and c are 200 and 100, so the triples are (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200). Similarly, for b=0: (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200), and for c=0: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). So, total of 6 solutions where one variable is zero. So, 6 solutions.\n\nBut earlier, when c=0, we had 6 permutations, but actually, no. Wait, if c=0, then a and b are 200 and 100, but since a and b are distinguishable variables, swapping a and b gives different triples. So, (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). Similarly, if a=0, then (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200), and same for b=0. So, total 2 permutations per zero case, times 3 variables, gives 6 solutions. So, 6 solutions where one variable is zero.\n\nCase 3: Now, what if two variables are zero? Suppose a = b = 0. Then c = 300. Then, the equation becomes 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \u2260 6,000,000. So, no solutions here.\n\nCase 4: All variables positive. So, a, b, c \u2265 1. Wait, but the problem states nonnegative integers, so they can be zero. But maybe there are solutions where all variables are positive (i.e., at least 1). Let's check.\n\nSuppose a, b, c \u2265 1. Then, perhaps similar to the symmetric solution (100, 100, 100). But are there others?\n\nWait, let's consider the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000. If we can find Q and P such that this holds, given S = 300.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider substituting variables. Let me set x = a - 100, y = b - 100, z = c - 100. Then, x + y + z = 0. But this might complicate things since variables can be negative. Alternatively, perhaps consider deviations from the symmetric solution.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000 with a + b + c = 300.\n\nLet me try small deviations. Suppose a = 100 + t, b = 100 + t, c = 100 - 2t. Then, check if this satisfies the equation.\n\nFirst, check a + b + c = 100 + t + 100 + t + 100 - 2t = 300. Okay, that works.\n\nCompute Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nab = (100 + t)(100 + t) = (100 + t)^2\n\nbc = (100 + t)(100 - 2t) = 100*100 - 200t + 100t - 2t\u00b2 = 10,000 - 100t - 2t\u00b2\n\nca = (100 + t)(100 - 2t) = same as bc\n\nSo, Q = (100 + t)^2 + 2*(10,000 - 100t - 2t\u00b2)\n\nCompute:\n\n(10,000 + 200t + t\u00b2) + 20,000 - 200t - 4t\u00b2 =\n\n10,000 + 200t + t\u00b2 + 20,000 - 200t - 4t\u00b2 =\n\n30,000 - 3t\u00b2\n\nThen, P = abc = (100 + t)^2*(100 - 2t)\n\nExpand:\n\n(10,000 + 200t + t\u00b2)(100 - 2t) =\n\n10,000*100 - 10,000*2t + 200t*100 - 200t*2t + t\u00b2*100 - t\u00b2*2t =\n\n1,000,000 - 20,000t + 20,000t - 400t\u00b2 + 100t\u00b2 - 2t\u00b3 =\n\n1,000,000 - 300t\u00b2 - 2t\u00b3\n\nNow, compute 100Q - P:\n\n100*(30,000 - 3t\u00b2) - (1,000,000 - 300t\u00b2 - 2t\u00b3) =\n\n3,000,000 - 300t\u00b2 - 1,000,000 + 300t\u00b2 + 2t\u00b3 =\n\n2,000,000 + 2t\u00b3\n\nSet this equal to 2,000,000:\n\n2,000,000 + 2t\u00b3 = 2,000,000 => 2t\u00b3 = 0 => t = 0\n\nSo, the only solution in this case is t = 0, which gives a = b = c = 100. So, no other solutions by this perturbation.\n\nAlternatively, try another perturbation. Suppose a = 100 + t, b = 100 - t, c = 100. Then, a + b + c = 300.\n\nCompute Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nab = (100 + t)(100 - t) = 10,000 - t\u00b2\n\nbc = (100 - t)(100) = 10,000 - 100t\n\nca = (100 + t)(100) = 10,000 + 100t\n\nSo, Q = (10,000 - t\u00b2) + (10,000 - 100t) + (10,000 + 100t) = 30,000 - t\u00b2\n\nP = abc = (100 + t)(100 - t)(100) = (10,000 - t\u00b2)*100 = 1,000,000 - 100t\u00b2\n\nThen, 100Q - P = 100*(30,000 - t\u00b2) - (1,000,000 - 100t\u00b2) = 3,000,000 - 100t\u00b2 - 1,000,000 + 100t\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nSo, regardless of t, this equals 2,000,000. Wait, that's interesting. So, for any t, as long as a = 100 + t, b = 100 - t, c = 100, then 100Q - P = 2,000,000. But we also need a + b + c = 300, which holds here. However, a, b, c must be nonnegative integers. So, t must be an integer such that 100 + t \u2265 0, 100 - t \u2265 0, and c = 100 \u2265 0. So, 100 + t \u2265 0 => t \u2265 -100, and 100 - t \u2265 0 => t \u2264 100. So, t can range from -100 to 100. But t must be an integer. Therefore, t \u2208 {-100, -99, ..., 99, 100}. However, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, t must be integer. Each t gives a distinct triple:\n\n(a, b, c) = (100 + t, 100 - t, 100)\n\nBut since a, b, c are nonnegative, t can be from -100 to 100. However, permutations might come into play here. Wait, but in this case, c is fixed at 100, while a and b vary. However, if we consider all permutations, such triples where two variables are 100 \u00b1 t and the third is 100 can be arranged in different ways.\n\nWait, hold on. Let's see. For example, if we take t = 1, then (101, 99, 100). Similarly, t = -1 gives (99, 101, 100). But these are different triples. However, if we consider all permutations, then each distinct permutation would be counted separately. However, in the problem statement, triples are ordered, so (101, 99, 100), (99, 101, 100), (100, 101, 99), etc., are all distinct solutions.\n\nWait, but in the perturbation above, we fixed c = 100 and varied a and b. But similarly, we could fix a = 100 and vary b and c, or fix b = 100 and vary a and c. So, for each of these, we can generate similar solutions.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose we fix one variable at 100 and let the other two variables be 100 + t and 100 - t. Then, for each variable fixed at 100, t can range from -100 to 100, but ensuring that 100 + t and 100 - t are nonnegative. So, t can be from -100 to 100, but since t must be integer, t \u2208 {-100, -99, ..., 99, 100}. For each fixed variable (either a, b, or c), we get 201 solutions (from t = -100 to t = 100). However, some solutions might overlap when t = 0, which gives the symmetric solution (100, 100, 100). Let's check.\n\nIf we fix a = 100, then the triples are (100, 100 + t, 100 - t). Similarly, fixing b = 100 gives (100 + t, 100, 100 - t), and fixing c = 100 gives (100 + t, 100 - t, 100). Each of these is a distinct set of triples unless t = 0. For t \u2260 0, each choice of fixed variable gives a different triple. For example, t = 1:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 101, 99)\n- Fixing b: (101, 100, 99)\n- Fixing c: (101, 99, 100)\n\nThese are all distinct permutations. However, when t = 0, all three fixings give (100, 100, 100), which is only one triple.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples from this method would be:\n\nFor each of the three variables fixed (a, b, c), we have t from -100 to 100, inclusive. That's 201 values per fixed variable. However, the triple (100, 100, 100) is counted three times (once in each fixed variable), but it should only be counted once. Therefore, total triples would be 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 - 2 = 601? Wait, no. Wait, each t from -100 to 100 gives a unique triple for each fixed variable, except when t = 0, which gives the same triple regardless of which variable is fixed. Wait, actually, no. When t = 0, fixing any variable gives (100, 100, 100). So, in each fixed variable case, t = 0 gives the same triple. Therefore, total number of distinct triples would be:\n\nFor each fixed variable:\n\n- t from -100 to -1: 100 values, each giving a unique triple not overlapping with other fixed variables\n- t from 1 to 100: 100 values, each giving a unique triple not overlapping with other fixed variables\n- t = 0: 1 value, same across all fixed variables\n\nTherefore, total triples:\n\n3*(100 + 100) + 1 = 3*200 + 1 = 600 + 1 = 601\n\nBut wait, let's verify with an example. For t = 1:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 101, 99)\n- Fixing b: (101, 100, 99)\n- Fixing c: (101, 99, 100)\n\nThese are three distinct triples. Similarly, for t = -1:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 99, 101)\n- Fixing b: (99, 100, 101)\n- Fixing c: (99, 101, 100)\n\nAgain, three distinct triples. For each t \u2260 0, we get three distinct triples. For t = 0, only one triple. Therefore, total number of triples is 3*200 + 1 = 601.\n\nBut wait, t ranges from -100 to 100, inclusive. That's 201 values. For each fixed variable, t = -100 to 100 gives 201 triples. However, overlapping only at t = 0. Wait, no. Wait, if we fix a variable, say a = 100, then t ranges from -100 to 100, giving 201 triples: (100, 100 + t, 100 - t). Similarly for fixing b and c. However, when t = 0, all three fixed variables give the same triple. But for other t, each fixed variable gives a different triple.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples would be 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 - 2 = 601. Because the triple (100, 100, 100) is counted three times in the 3*201 count, so we subtract 2 to get the correct count of 1.\n\nTherefore, these perturbations give us 601 solutions. However, earlier we found 6 solutions where one variable is zero. Wait, but are these perturbations including the all-100 case and the cases where variables are zero?\n\nWait, no. Because in the perturbation where we fix one variable at 100 and vary the other two, we require that the varied variables are 100 \u00b1 t. If t = 100, then one variable becomes 200 and the other becomes 0. For example, fixing a = 100, t = 100 gives (100, 200, 0). Similarly, t = -100 gives (100, 0, 200). So, these cases where one variable is zero are included in the perturbation method. Therefore, the 601 solutions include the 6 solutions with one zero variable and the symmetric solution (100, 100, 100). Wait, but hold on:\n\nWait, when we fix a variable at 100 and set t = 100, we get triples like (100, 200, 0). Similarly, t = -100 gives (100, 0, 200). So, for each fixed variable, t = 100 and t = -100 give triples where one variable is zero. Since there are three fixed variables, each contributing two such triples (t = \u00b1100), but actually:\n\nWait, fixing a = 100:\n\n- t = 100: (100, 200, 0)\n- t = -100: (100, 0, 200)\n\nSimilarly, fixing b = 100:\n\n- t = 100: (200, 100, 0)\n- t = -100: (0, 100, 200)\n\nFixing c = 100:\n\n- t = 100: (200, 0, 100)\n- t = -100: (0, 200, 100)\n\nSo, total of 6 triples where one variable is zero, which matches our earlier finding. Therefore, the 601 solutions include:\n\n- 1 triple where all variables are 100\n- 6 triples where one variable is zero\n- 601 - 1 - 6 = 594 triples where all variables are positive and not all equal\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, 3 fixed variables, each with t from -100 to 100 (201 values). For each fixed variable:\n\n- t = 0: (100, 100, 100)\n- t = \u00b1100: two triples with a zero\n- t from -99 to -1 and 1 to 99: 198 values, each giving triples with all variables positive and not all equal\n\nTherefore, per fixed variable:\n\n- 1 (t=0) + 2 (t=\u00b1100) + 198 (other t) = 201\n\nTotal across three fixed variables:\n\n- 3*1 = 3 (but only 1 unique triple for t=0)\n- 3*2 = 6 (unique triples with a zero)\n- 3*198 = 594 (unique triples with all variables positive and not all equal)\n\nBut when we count all three fixed variables, the t from -99 to -1 and 1 to 99 for each fixed variable give unique triples. For example, t=1 in fixed a gives (100, 101, 99), t=1 in fixed b gives (101, 100, 99), t=1 in fixed c gives (101, 99, 100). So, each t \u2260 0, \u00b1100 in each fixed variable gives a distinct triple. Therefore, total triples are:\n\n1 (all 100s) + 6 (with a zero) + 594 (all positive and distinct) = 601\n\nTherefore, total solutions found so far are 601. But wait, earlier when we considered the case where one variable is zero, we found 6 solutions, which are included in these 601. The symmetric solution is 1, included as well. So, are there any other solutions outside of these?\n\nWait, suppose there exists a solution where none of the variables is 100 and none is zero. For example, a = 101, b = 101, c = 98. Then, a + b + c = 300. Let's check if this satisfies the second equation.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\na = 101, b = 101, c = 98\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = 101\u00b2*101 = 101\u00b3\n\na\u00b2c = 101\u00b2*98\n\nb\u00b2a = 101\u00b2*101 = same as a\u00b2b\n\nb\u00b2c = 101\u00b2*98\n\nc\u00b2a = 98\u00b2*101\n\nc\u00b2b = 98\u00b2*101\n\nSo, total sum:\n\n2*101\u00b3 + 2*101\u00b2*98 + 2*98\u00b2*101\n\nFactor out 2*101:\n\n2*101*(101\u00b2 + 101*98 + 98\u00b2)\n\nCompute inside the parentheses:\n\n101\u00b2 + 101*98 + 98\u00b2\n\n= (101\u00b2 + 98\u00b2) + 101*98\n\nCalculate 101\u00b2 = 10,201, 98\u00b2 = 9,604, 101*98 = 9,898\n\nSo, total inside: 10,201 + 9,604 + 9,898 = 29,703\n\nTherefore, total sum: 2*101*29,703 = 202*29,703\n\nCalculate 200*29,703 = 5,940,600\n\n2*29,703 = 59,406\n\nTotal: 5,940,600 + 59,406 = 6,000,006\n\nWait, that's 6,000,006, which is 6 more than 6,000,000. So, this does not satisfy the equation. Close, but not quite. So, this triple is not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another example. Let me try a = 102, b = 99, c = 99. Then, a + b + c = 300.\n\nCompute the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 102\u00b2*99 + 102\u00b2*99 + 99\u00b2*102 + 99\u00b2*99 + 99\u00b2*102 + 99\u00b2*99\n\nSimplify:\n\n2*102\u00b2*99 + 2*99\u00b2*102 + 2*99\u00b3\n\nFactor:\n\n2*99*(102\u00b2 + 99*102 + 99\u00b2)\n\nCompute inside:\n\n102\u00b2 + 99*102 + 99\u00b2\n\n= (102\u00b2 + 99\u00b2) + 99*102\n\nCalculate 102\u00b2 = 10,404, 99\u00b2 = 9,801, 99*102 = 10,098\n\nTotal inside: 10,404 + 9,801 + 10,098 = 30,303\n\nTotal sum: 2*99*30,303 = 198*30,303\n\nCalculate 200*30,303 = 6,060,600, subtract 2*30,303 = 60,606: 6,060,600 - 60,606 = 5,999,994\n\nWhich is 6 less than 6,000,000. Again, close but not exact. So, this suggests that perturbing around 100 gives sums close to 6,000,000, but only the exact case when variables are 100 or with one variable zero gives the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no other solutions outside the 601 found earlier. Therefore, perhaps the total number of solutions is 601 + 6? Wait, no, because the 601 already includes the 6 solutions with a zero. Wait, no, earlier calculation showed that the 601 includes 1 symmetric solution, 6 zeros, and 594 others. But when we tested examples outside of these, they didn't work. So, maybe the only solutions are those 601.\n\nBut wait, let's verify with another case. Suppose two variables are equal and the third is different, but not zero. For example, a = b = 101, c = 98. Then, a + b + c = 300. Compute the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 101\u00b2*101 + 101\u00b2*98 + 101\u00b2*101 + 101\u00b2*98 + 98\u00b2*101 + 98\u00b2*101\n\n= 2*101\u00b3 + 2*101\u00b2*98 + 2*98\u00b2*101\n\nFactor out 2*101:\n\n2*101*(101\u00b2 + 101*98 + 98\u00b2)\n\nAs before, this equals 2*101*(10,201 + 9,898 + 9,604) = 2*101*29,703 = 6,000,006, which is over by 6. So, not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, a = 99, b = 99, c = 102. Similar to above, sum would be 6,000,006 - 12 = 5,999,994. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a solution where variables are not near 100. For example, a = 150, b = 150, c = 0. Then, sum is 300, but the equation gives:\n\n150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 0 + 0 = 2*150\u00b3 = 2*3,375,000 = 6,750,000 \u2260 6,000,000. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, a = 50, b = 50, c = 200. Then, compute:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 50\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*200 + 50\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*200 + 200\u00b2*50 + 200\u00b2*50\n\n= 2*50\u00b3 + 2*50\u00b2*200 + 2*200\u00b2*50\n\n= 2*(125,000) + 2*(250,000) + 2*(2,000,000)\n\n= 250,000 + 500,000 + 4,000,000 = 4,750,000 \u2260 6,000,000\n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, a = 120, b = 100, c = 80. Then, compute:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 120\u00b2*100 + 120\u00b2*80 + 100\u00b2*120 + 100\u00b2*80 + 80\u00b2*120 + 80\u00b2*100\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n120\u00b2*100 = 14,400*100 = 1,440,000\n\n120\u00b2*80 = 14,400*80 = 1,152,000\n\n100\u00b2*120 = 10,000*120 = 1,200,000\n\n100\u00b2*80 = 10,000*80 = 800,000\n\n80\u00b2*120 = 6,400*120 = 768,000\n\n80\u00b2*100 = 6,400*100 = 640,000\n\nTotal sum: 1,440,000 + 1,152,000 + 1,200,000 + 800,000 + 768,000 + 640,000\n\nAdd them up:\n\n1,440,000 + 1,152,000 = 2,592,000\n\n2,592,000 + 1,200,000 = 3,792,000\n\n3,792,000 + 800,000 = 4,592,000\n\n4,592,000 + 768,000 = 5,360,000\n\n5,360,000 + 640,000 = 6,000,000\n\nWait, that works! So, this triple (120, 100, 80) satisfies the equation. But according to our previous count, this should be included in the 601 solutions. Let's check.\n\nIf we fix c = 100, then a = 100 + t, b = 100 - t. If t = 20, then a = 120, b = 80, c = 100. So, yes, this is part of the perturbation when we fix c = 100 and t = 20. Therefore, this solution is included in the 601 count.\n\nSimilarly, permutations of this triple, like (120, 80, 100), (100, 120, 80), etc., are also included when we fix different variables. So, indeed, this solution is already accounted for in the 601 solutions.\n\nTherefore, it seems that all solutions are captured by the 601 count, which includes the symmetric solution, the 6 solutions with one zero, and the rest being permutations where one variable is 100 and the other two are 100 \u00b1 t.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm with another example. Take a = 110, b = 100, c = 90. Then, check the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 110\u00b2*100 + 110\u00b2*90 + 100\u00b2*110 + 100\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*110 + 90\u00b2*100\n\nCompute each term:\n\n110\u00b2*100 = 12,100*100 = 1,210,000\n\n110\u00b2*90 = 12,100*90 = 1,089,000\n\n100\u00b2*110 = 10,000*110 = 1,100,000\n\n100\u00b2*90 = 10,000*90 = 900,000\n\n90\u00b2*110 = 8,100*110 = 891,000\n\n90\u00b2*100 = 8,100*100 = 810,000\n\nTotal sum: 1,210,000 + 1,089,000 + 1,100,000 + 900,000 + 891,000 + 810,000\n\nAdding up:\n\n1,210,000 + 1,089,000 = 2,299,000\n\n2,299,000 + 1,100,000 = 3,399,000\n\n3,399,000 + 900,000 = 4,299,000\n\n4,299,000 + 891,000 = 5,190,000\n\n5,190,000 + 810,000 = 6,000,000\n\nYes, this also works. And this triple is part of the perturbation when fixing b = 100, t = 10: (110, 100, 90). So, included in the 601 solutions.\n\nTherefore, it seems that all solutions are of the form where one variable is 100, and the other two are 100 \u00b1 t, or permutations thereof, including cases where one variable is zero. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 601.\n\nBut wait, earlier we thought the count was 601, but let's verify the arithmetic.\n\nWhen we fix each variable (a, b, c) and let t range from -100 to 100, that's 201 values per variable. However, when t = 0, all three fixed variables give the same solution (100, 100, 100). For other t, each fixed variable gives a distinct solution. So, total number of solutions is:\n\nFor each fixed variable:\n\n- t = -100 to -1: 100 values, each giving a unique solution\n- t = 1 to 100: 100 values, each giving a unique solution\n- t = 0: 1 value, same across all fixed variables\n\nTherefore, per fixed variable: 200 unique solutions + 1 shared solution.\n\nTotal across three fixed variables: 3*200 + 1 = 601.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the total number of solutions is 601.\n\nBut wait, earlier we found that when one variable is zero, there are 6 solutions, which are included in these 601. The symmetric solution is 1, and the rest are 601 - 1 - 6 = 594 solutions where all variables are positive and not all equal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. But let's confirm if there are any other solutions outside this set.\n\nSuppose there exists a solution not captured by this perturbation. For example, a = 110, b = 90, c = 100. This is included in the perturbation when fixing c = 100, t = 10. So, yes, it's included.\n\nAnother example: a = 50, b = 150, c = 100. Fixing c = 100, t = -50. So, a = 100 - 50 = 50, b = 100 + 50 = 150. So, included.\n\nWhat about a = 200, b = 50, c = 50. Then, a + b + c = 300. Compute the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 200\u00b2*50 + 200\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*200 + 50\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*200 + 50\u00b2*50\n\n= 2*200\u00b2*50 + 2*50\u00b2*200 + 2*50\u00b3\n\n= 2*4,000,000*50 + 2*2,500*200 + 2*125,000\n\nWait, compute each term:\n\n200\u00b2*50 = 40,000*50 = 2,000,000\n\nSimilarly, the other term same: 2,000,000\n\n50\u00b2*200 = 2,500*200 = 500,000\n\nSimilarly, the other term same: 500,000\n\n50\u00b3 = 125,000\n\nSimilarly, the other term same: 125,000\n\nTotal sum: 2*2,000,000 + 2*500,000 + 2*125,000 = 4,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 250,000 = 5,250,000 \u2260 6,000,000\n\nSo, not a solution. Therefore, this triple is not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, a = 250, b = 25, c = 25. Sum is 300. Compute:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 250\u00b2*25 + 250\u00b2*25 + 25\u00b2*250 + 25\u00b2*25 + 25\u00b2*250 + 25\u00b2*25\n\n= 2*250\u00b2*25 + 2*25\u00b2*250 + 2*25\u00b3\n\nCalculate:\n\n250\u00b2*25 = 62,500*25 = 1,562,500\n\n25\u00b2*250 = 625*250 = 156,250\n\n25\u00b3 = 15,625\n\nTotal sum: 2*1,562,500 + 2*156,250 + 2*15,625 = 3,125,000 + 312,500 + 31,250 = 3,468,750 \u2260 6,000,000\n\nNot a solution.\n\nTherefore, it seems that all solutions are indeed captured by the perturbation method, leading to 601 solutions. However, let's check if the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000 has any other solutions outside of these.\n\nSuppose we have a solution where none of the variables is 100 or zero, and they are not of the form 100 \u00b1 t. For example, a = 101, b = 101, c = 98. As before, this gives a sum exceeding 6,000,000. Similarly, other close numbers either exceed or fall short. Therefore, it's likely that the only solutions are the 601 found.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples is 601. But wait, the problem asks for nonnegative integers, so including the permutations where variables can be zero. But according to our analysis, all solutions are accounted for in the 601 count, which includes the 6 permutations with a zero and the symmetric solution.\n\nBut let me verify once more. The key equation we derived is 100Q - P = 2,000,000, with Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc, given that a + b + c = 300. We found that all solutions are of the form where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, being 100 + t and 100 - t. This includes cases where t = \u00b1100, leading to a zero variable. Therefore, these are all solutions.\n\nHence, the total number of solutions is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me check the arithmetic again. For each fixed variable (a, b, c), t ranges from -100 to 100, which is 201 values. For each fixed variable, this gives 201 ordered triples. However, when we fix different variables, some triples are permutations of each other. For example, fixing a = 100 and t = 1 gives (100, 101, 99), fixing b = 100 and t = 1 gives (101, 100, 99), and fixing c = 100 and t = 1 gives (101, 99, 100). These are three distinct ordered triples. Similarly, for each t \u2260 0, we get three distinct ordered triples. For t = 0, all three fixed variables give the same ordered triple (100, 100, 100). For t = \u00b1100, each fixed variable gives a unique ordered triple with a zero, but these are distinct from each other.\n\nTherefore, total number of ordered triples is:\n\n- For each t from -100 to 100, excluding 0: 200 values\n- For each t, three ordered triples (from fixing each variable)\n- Plus one ordered triple for t = 0\n\nTotal: 200*3 + 1 = 600 + 1 = 601\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the total number of ordered triples is 601.\n\nBut let me confirm with another example. Take t = 50:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 150, 50)\n- Fixing b: (150, 100, 50)\n- Fixing c: (150, 50, 100)\n\nThese are three distinct ordered triples. Similarly, t = -50:\n\n- Fixing a: (100, 50, 150)\n- Fixing b: (50, 100, 150)\n- Fixing c: (50, 150, 100)\n\nAgain, three distinct ordered triples. Each t \u2260 0 gives three ordered triples, and t = 0 gives one. Therefore, total is 3*200 + 1 = 601.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. However, the problem statement says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", which are ordered, so this count is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other solutions outside this set. Suppose we have a solution where two variables are equal and the third is different, but not related to 100. For example, a = b = 150, c = 0. But we already saw that this gives a sum of 6,750,000, which is too high. Similarly, a = b = 50, c = 200 gives a sum of 4,750,000, which is too low. So, no solutions there.\n\nAlternatively, a = 90, b = 90, c = 120. Compute:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 120\u00b2*90 + 120\u00b2*90\n\n= 2*90\u00b3 + 2*90\u00b2*120 + 2*120\u00b2*90\n\nCalculate:\n\n90\u00b3 = 729,000\n\n90\u00b2*120 = 8,100*120 = 972,000\n\n120\u00b2*90 = 14,400*90 = 1,296,000\n\nTotal sum: 2*729,000 + 2*972,000 + 2*1,296,000 = 1,458,000 + 1,944,000 + 2,592,000 = 6,000,000\n\nWait, this works! So, (90, 90, 120) is a solution. But according to our previous count, this should be included. Let's see.\n\nIf we fix c = 120, then a and b would need to be 100 \u00b1 t. Wait, but 90 and 90 don't fit that form. Wait, unless t is negative. Wait, if we fix c = 100, then a = 100 + t, b = 100 - t. But in this case, c = 120, which is different. So, this solution is not captured by our previous perturbation method.\n\nWait, this is a problem. So, there exists a solution not captured by the previous method. Therefore, our earlier conclusion that all solutions are of the form with one variable fixed at 100 is incorrect.\n\nSo, this suggests that there are other solutions outside the 601 count. Therefore, our previous approach missed some solutions.\n\nLet's analyze this new solution: a = 90, b = 90, c = 120. Check a + b + c = 300. Yes. Compute the sum:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 90\u00b2*90 + 90\u00b2*120 + 120\u00b2*90 + 120\u00b2*90\n\n= 2*90\u00b3 + 2*90\u00b2*120 + 2*120\u00b2*90\n\n= 2*729,000 + 2*972,000 + 2*1,296,000\n\n= 1,458,000 + 1,944,000 + 2,592,000\n\n= 6,000,000\n\nYes, correct. So, this triple is a valid solution. But it's not of the form where one variable is 100 and the other two are 100 \u00b1 t. Therefore, our previous count of 601 is incomplete.\n\nThis means there are solutions outside the perturbation around 100. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nLet me think. The equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, with Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc, and a + b + c = 300.\n\nLet me rewrite the equation as:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\n\nSo, P = 100Q - 2,000,000\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can set two variables equal and solve.\n\nLet me assume a = b. Then, c = 300 - 2a.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000\n\nSince a = b, c = 300 - 2a:\n\na*a*(300 - 2a) = 100(a*a + a*(300 - 2a) + a*(300 - 2a)) - 2,000,000\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2(300 - 2a) = 100(a\u00b2 + 2a(300 - 2a)) - 2,000,000\n\nCompute right side:\n\n100(a\u00b2 + 600a - 4a\u00b2) = 100(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a\n\nLeft side:\n\n300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3\n\nEquation:\n\n300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3 = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3 + 300a\u00b2 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(300a\u00b2 + 300a\u00b2) - 2a\u00b3 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0\n\n600a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3 - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 - 30,000a + 1,000,000 = 0\n\nRearrange:\n\n-a\u00b3 + 300a\u00b2 - 30,000a + 1,000,000 = 0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nThis is the same cubic equation as before when we set two variables equal. Earlier, we found that a = 100 is a root. Let's factor it:\n\n(a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000) = 0\n\nWhich factors further as (a - 100)^3 = 0. Therefore, the only solution is a = 100. Therefore, when a = b, the only solution is a = b = 100, c = 100. So, the symmetric solution.\n\nBut wait, in our example earlier, a = b = 90, c = 120 is a solution. But according to this, setting a = b leads only to the symmetric solution. Therefore, this suggests that the solution a = b = 90, c = 120 is not captured by setting a = b. Therefore, there must be solutions where all three variables are distinct.\n\nThis indicates that our initial approach missed solutions where variables are not perturbations of 100 or zero. Therefore, we need a different method.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the original equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWe can factor this as:\n\nab(a + c) + bc(b + a) + ca(c + b) = 6,000,000\n\nBut not sure if helpful. Alternatively, note that:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) - 3abc\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a + ca\u00b2\n\nWhich is the same as the original expression plus 3abc. Therefore:\n\nOriginal expression = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) - 3abc\n\nBut not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, recall that we have:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nWhere Q = ab + bc + ca, P = abc, and a + b + c = 300.\n\nLet me think of this as an equation in variables a, b, c. Maybe we can use substitution.\n\nLet me denote two variables, say, x = a, y = b, then c = 300 - x - y.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\n100(xy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y)) - x y (300 - x - y) = 2,000,000\n\nThis is similar to what I did earlier. Let's compute Q and P:\n\nQ = xy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y) = 300(x + y) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 - xy\n\nP = xy(300 - x - y)\n\nSo, equation:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nSubstitute Q and P:\n\n100[300(x + y) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 - xy] - xy(300 - x - y) = 2,000,000\n\nExpand:\n\n30,000(x + y) - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 - 100xy - 300xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n30,000x + 30,000y - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 - 400xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nThis is a diophantine equation in two variables x and y, with x, y \u2265 0 and x + y \u2264 300.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can look for integer solutions where x and y are such that x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 - 400xy - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 + 30,000x + 30,000y = 2,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, factor terms:\n\nxy(x + y) - 400xy - 100(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + 30,000(x + y) = 2,000,000\n\nBut x + y = 300 - z, where z = c. But z = 300 - x - y, so x + y = 300 - z. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that x and y are positive integers less than 300. This equation might have solutions other than the ones we found earlier. For example, the solution (90, 90, 120):\n\nPlugging x = 90, y = 90:\n\nLeft side:\n\n30,000*90 + 30,000*90 - 100*90\u00b2 - 100*90\u00b2 - 400*90*90 + 90\u00b2*90 + 90*90\u00b2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n30,000*90 = 2,700,000\n\n30,000*90 = 2,700,000\n\n-100*90\u00b2 = -100*8,100 = -810,000\n\n-100*90\u00b2 = -810,000\n\n-400*90*90 = -400*8,100 = -3,240,000\n\n90\u00b2*90 = 729,000\n\n90*90\u00b2 = 729,000\n\nTotal sum:\n\n2,700,000 + 2,700,000 - 810,000 - 810,000 - 3,240,000 + 729,000 + 729,000\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n2,700,000 + 2,700,000 = 5,400,000\n\n5,400,000 - 810,000 - 810,000 = 5,400,000 - 1,620,000 = 3,780,000\n\n3,780,000 - 3,240,000 = 540,000\n\n540,000 + 729,000 + 729,000 = 540,000 + 1,458,000 = 1,998,000\n\nWait, but this is supposed to be 2,000,000. There's a discrepancy of 2,000. Did I compute something wrong?\n\nWait, let's recompute:\n\nFor x = 90, y = 90:\n\n30,000x + 30,000y = 30,000*90 + 30,000*90 = 2,700,000 + 2,700,000 = 5,400,000\n\n-100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 = -100*(90\u00b2 + 90\u00b2) = -100*(8,100 + 8,100) = -100*16,200 = -1,620,000\n\n-400xy = -400*90*90 = -400*8,100 = -3,240,000\n\nx\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 90\u00b2*90 + 90*90\u00b2 = 729,000 + 729,000 = 1,458,000\n\nTotal sum: 5,400,000 - 1,620,000 - 3,240,000 + 1,458,000 =\n\n5,400,000 - 1,620,000 = 3,780,000\n\n3,780,000 - 3,240,000 = 540,000\n\n540,000 + 1,458,000 = 1,998,000\n\nBut the equation requires this to be 2,000,000. So, discrepancy of 2,000. However, we know that (90, 90, 120) is a solution. Therefore, there must be an error in the substitution or calculation.\n\nWait, no. The equation we derived is:\n\n30,000x + 30,000y - 100x\u00b2 - 100y\u00b2 - 400xy + x\u00b2y + xy\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nBut when we plug in x = 90, y = 90, we get 1,998,000, which is 2,000 less than required. However, when we computed the original expression for (90, 90, 120), we got 6,000,000. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the substitution process.\n\nWait, let's go back. The original equation after substitution was:\n\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nWhere Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.\n\nFor (90, 90, 120):\n\nQ = 90*90 + 90*120 + 90*120 = 8,100 + 10,800 + 10,800 = 29,700\n\nP = 90*90*120 = 972,000\n\nThen, 100Q - P = 100*29,700 - 972,000 = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000\n\nWait, but this contradicts the earlier calculation where the sum was 6,000,000. There's a mistake here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000 was derived from the original equation:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nBut when we computed the sum for (90, 90, 120), we got 6,000,000, but according to 100Q - P, we get 1,998,000 \u2260 2,000,000. This inconsistency suggests an error in the derivation.\n\nWait, let's re-derive the equation step by step.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWe rewrote this as:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nThen, using identities:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nCompute:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000\n\nSimplifies to:\n\n300Q - 3P = 6,000,000 => 100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nThis derivation seems correct. Therefore, if (90, 90, 120) satisfies the original equation, then 100Q - P must equal 2,000,000. But according to Q = 29,700 and P = 972,000:\n\n100Q - P = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000 \u2260 2,000,000\n\nThis contradiction implies that there's an error in our calculations. Wait, let's recompute Q and P for (90, 90, 120):\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca = 90*90 + 90*120 + 90*120 = 8,100 + 10,800 + 10,800 = 29,700\n\nP = abc = 90*90*120 = 972,000\n\n100Q - P = 100*29,700 - 972,000 = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000\n\nBut according to the original equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWhich we computed earlier as 6,000,000. Therefore, there's a contradiction, meaning our derivation of 100Q - P = 2,000,000 is incorrect.\n\nWait, this is a serious issue. Let's re-examine the derivation.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWe rewrote this as:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b) = 6,000,000\n\nThen, since a + b + c = 300, we substituted:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nWhich expands to:\n\n300a\u00b2 - a\u00b3 + 300b\u00b2 - b\u00b3 + 300c\u00b2 - c\u00b3 = 6,000,000\n\nFactor:\n\n300(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - (a\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3) = 6,000,000\n\nThis step is correct.\n\nThen, using the identities:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 300\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q\n\na\u00b3 + b\u00b3 + c\u00b3 = S\u00b3 - 3SQ + 3P = 300\u00b3 - 3*300*Q + 3P = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P) = 6,000,000\n\nCompute:\n\n27,000,000 - 600Q",
