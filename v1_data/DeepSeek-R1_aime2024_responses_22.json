        "question": "Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on the hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{20}- \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1$ such that $ABCD$ is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. Find the greatest real number that is less than $BD^2$ for all such rhombi.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, where the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin... That probably means the diagonals are the lines through the origin, right? Because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so if they intersect at the origin, then each diagonal must pass through the origin. So points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the diagonals must be two lines passing through the origin, perpendicular to each other. So, suppose one diagonal is along some line through the origin, and the other diagonal is along the perpendicular line through the origin.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, the vertices of the rhombus should be symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis. Wait, but hyperbola is symmetric about both axes, so maybe the rhombus is also symmetric about both axes? If that's the case, then the vertices might be in pairs like (p, q), (-p, q), (-p, -q), (p, -q). But in a rhombus, all sides are equal. Let me check if such a quadrilateral would form a rhombus.\n\nWait, if the points are (p, q), (-p, q), (-p, -q), (p, -q), then the sides would be from (p, q) to (-p, q), which is length 2p horizontally, then from (-p, q) to (-p, -q), which is length 2q vertically, etc. But that would actually form a rectangle, not a rhombus, unless p = q. But since it's a hyperbola, p and q can't be equal unless specific conditions. So maybe my initial thought is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rhombus is not necessarily symmetric about both axes, but just has diagonals intersecting at the origin. Since diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, maybe each diagonal is a line with some slope m and -1/m passing through the origin.\n\nSo, let's parametrize the diagonals. Let\u2019s say one diagonal is along the line y = m x, and the other diagonal is along the line y = -1/m x. Then the vertices of the rhombus lie on these two lines. Since the rhombus is inscribed in the hyperbola, each vertex must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1.\n\nSo, suppose points A and C are on the line y = m x, and points B and D are on the line y = -1/m x. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, if A is (a, m a), then C is (-a, -m a). Similarly, if B is (b, -1/m b), then D is (-b, 1/m b).\n\nSo the four points are A(a, m a), C(-a, -m a), B(b, -b/m), D(-b, b/m). All these points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Therefore, substituting each point into the hyperbola equation:\n\nFor point A(a, m a):\na\u00b2/20 - (m\u00b2 a\u00b2)/24 = 1 --> a\u00b2(1/20 - m\u00b2/24) = 1 --> a\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24)\n\nSimilarly, for point B(b, -b/m):\nb\u00b2/20 - ( ( (-b/m)\u00b2 ) /24 ) = 1 --> b\u00b2/20 - (b\u00b2/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1 --> b\u00b2(1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1 --> b\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2))\n\nSo, we have expressions for a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 in terms of m. Then BD is the distance between points B(b, -b/m) and D(-b, b/m). Let's compute BD\u00b2.\n\nBD\u00b2 = [(-b - b)^2 + (b/m - (-b/m))^2] = [(-2b)^2 + (2b/m)^2] = 4b\u00b2 + 4b\u00b2/m\u00b2 = 4b\u00b2(1 + 1/m\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, AC is the distance between A(a, m a) and C(-a, -m a):\n\nAC\u00b2 = [(-a - a)^2 + (-m a - m a)^2] = [(-2a)^2 + (-2 m a)^2] = 4a\u00b2 + 4m\u00b2 a\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2(1 + m\u00b2)\n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the area is (AC * BD)/2. However, maybe we don't need the area here. The problem is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, and then take the greatest number less than BD\u00b2, which would be the infimum if BD\u00b2 can approach it.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2 is expressed in terms of m. So we need to analyze BD\u00b2 as a function of m and find its minimum value. Then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Wait, but maybe BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily large or small? Let me check.\n\nFirst, let's express BD\u00b2 in terms of m. From above:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4b\u00b2(1 + 1/m\u00b2)\n\nBut b\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1 / [ (6 m\u00b2 - 5)/120 m\u00b2 ) ] = 120 m\u00b2 / (6 m\u00b2 - 5)\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = 4 * [120 m\u00b2 / (6 m\u00b2 - 5)] * (1 + 1/m\u00b2) = 4 * 120 m\u00b2 / (6 m\u00b2 -5) * ( (m\u00b2 + 1)/m\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * 120 m\u00b2 * (m\u00b2 + 1) / [ (6 m\u00b2 -5) m\u00b2 ] = 480 (m\u00b2 + 1) / (6 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nSo BD\u00b2 = 480 (m\u00b2 + 1)/(6 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 = 4a\u00b2(1 + m\u00b2). Let's compute a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24 ) = 1 / [ (6 - 5 m\u00b2)/120 ] = 120 / (6 -5 m\u00b2 )\n\nSo AC\u00b2 = 4 * (120 / (6 -5 m\u00b2 )) * (1 + m\u00b2 ) = 480 (1 + m\u00b2 ) / (6 -5 m\u00b2 )\n\nBut since ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals must be real and the denominators in a\u00b2 and b\u00b2 must be positive. So for a\u00b2 to be positive: 1/20 - m\u00b2/24 > 0 --> 1/20 > m\u00b2/24 --> m\u00b2 < 24/20 = 6/5. Similarly, for b\u00b2 positive: 1/20 -1/(24 m\u00b2 ) >0 --> 1/20 >1/(24 m\u00b2 ) --> 24 m\u00b2 >20 --> m\u00b2 >20/24 =5/6.\n\nTherefore, m\u00b2 must be in (5/6, 6/5). So m\u00b2 is between 5/6 and 6/5. So m can be positive or negative, but since m\u00b2 is considered, we can just take m\u00b2 in that interval.\n\nSo BD\u00b2 = 480 (m\u00b2 +1 )/(6 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2 over m\u00b2 \u2208 (5/6, 6/5). Because the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", which is equivalent to the infimum of BD\u00b2. So if BD\u00b2 can approach a certain value but never be less than that, then the answer is that value.\n\nSo let's analyze BD\u00b2 as a function of t = m\u00b2, where t \u2208 (5/6, 6/5). So BD\u00b2(t) = 480 (t +1)/(6 t -5 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(t) over t \u2208 (5/6, 6/5). Let's compute derivative of BD\u00b2(t) with respect to t:\n\nLet f(t) = 480 (t +1)/(6 t -5 )\n\nf\u2019(t) = 480 [ (1)(6t -5) - (t +1)(6) ] / (6t -5)^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(6t -5) -6(t +1) =6t -5 -6t -6= -11\n\nTherefore, f\u2019(t) =480*(-11)/(6t -5)^2 = -5280/(6t -5)^2\n\nSince the derivative is always negative (because denominator is squared, so positive, and numerator is negative), f(t) is decreasing on the interval t \u2208 (5/6, 6/5). Therefore, the minimum of BD\u00b2 occurs at the right endpoint of the interval, which is t =6/5.\n\nBut wait, since the function is decreasing, as t increases, BD\u00b2 decreases. Therefore, the minimum BD\u00b2 is achieved when t is maximum, i.e., t=6/5. But wait, let me check:\n\nWait, t is m\u00b2, which ranges from 5/6 to6/5. Since f(t) is decreasing, the minimum value of BD\u00b2 is at t=6/5, and the maximum value is at t=5/6.\n\nBut we need the infimum of BD\u00b2, which would be the limit as t approaches6/5 from the left. Wait, but t can actually reach6/5? Wait, no, because when t=6/5, the denominator for a\u00b2 becomes 6 -5*(6/5)=6 -6=0, which would make a\u00b2 undefined. Similarly, when t approaches6/5 from below, a\u00b2 approaches infinity, so point A goes to infinity. Similarly, when t approaches5/6 from above, b\u00b2 approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but BD\u00b2(t) =480 (t +1)/(6t -5 ). As t approaches6/5 from below, denominator 6t -5 approaches6*(6/5) -5=36/5 -25/5=11/5, so BD\u00b2 approaches480*(6/5 +1)/(11/5)=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480. Wait, that's interesting. Wait, no:\n\nWait, t approaches6/5 from below:\n\n6t -5 approaches6*(6/5) -5=36/5 -25/5=11/5, which is positive. So BD\u00b2 approaches480*(6/5 +1)/(11/5)=480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480*1=480.\n\nWait, but when t approaches6/5 from below, BD\u00b2 approaches480. Similarly, when t approaches5/6 from above, BD\u00b2(t)=480*(5/6 +1)/(6*(5/6)-5)=480*(11/6)/(5 -5)=480*(11/6)/0, which tends to infinity. So BD\u00b2(t) ranges from480 to infinity as t moves from6/5 down to5/6.\n\nWait, but earlier we saw that BD\u00b2(t) is decreasing on t \u2208(5/6,6/5). Wait, but t is in(5/6,6/5). So as t increases from5/6 to6/5, BD\u00b2(t) decreases from infinity down to480. Therefore, BD\u00b2 can take any value from480 upwards. Therefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is480, and since BD\u00b2 must be greater than480 for all rhombi, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is480.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to480 but never actually be480, then the answer is480. But wait, when t approaches6/5 from below, BD\u00b2 approaches480. However, when t=6/5, the point A would require a\u00b2=1/(1/20 - (6/5)/24)=1/(1/20 -1/20)=1/0, which is undefined. So BD\u00b2 can approach480 but never actually reach it. Therefore, the infimum is480, but it's not attained. Hence, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480.\n\nBut let me verify this conclusion again. Since BD\u00b2(t) is decreasing from infinity to480 as t increases from5/6 to6/5, BD\u00b2 can take any value in(480, \u221e). Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is480. So the answer should be480. But let me check with specific values.\n\nSuppose t approaches6/5, say t=6/5 - \u03b5, where \u03b5 is very small positive number. Then BD\u00b2=480*( (6/5 - \u03b5 +1 )/(6*(6/5 - \u03b5) -5 ))=480*( (11/5 - \u03b5)/(36/5 -6\u03b5 -5 ))=480*( (11/5 - \u03b5)/(11/5 -6\u03b5 )). As \u03b5 approaches0, this becomes480*(11/5)/(11/5)=480. So BD\u00b2 approaches480. Therefore,480 is the infimum. Since BD\u00b2 is always greater than480, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is480. Therefore, the answer is\\boxed{480}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}"
