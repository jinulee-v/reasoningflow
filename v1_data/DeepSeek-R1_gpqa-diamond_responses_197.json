        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution. The problem gives me the total cobalt concentration as 10^-2 M and the thiocyanate concentration as 0.1 M. The stability constants \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, \u03b24 are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16, respectively. Hmm, wait, stability constants usually refer to the formation of complexes where each step adds a ligand. So \u03b2n would be the cumulative stability constant for the complex with n ligands. \n\nFirst, I need to recall that for a metal ion M and a ligand L forming complexes ML, ML2, ..., MLn, the cumulative stability constants \u03b2n are given by \u03b2n = [MLn]/([M][L]^n). So each \u03b2n corresponds to the formation of the nth complex directly from the metal ion and n ligands. \n\nIn this case, the cobalt(II) ion (Co^2+) is reacting with thiocyanate ions (SCN^-) to form complexes: Co(SCN)+ (\u03b21=9), Co(SCN)2 (\u03b22=40), Co(SCN)3^- (\u03b23=63), and Co(SCN)4^2- (\u03b24=16). Wait, but the problem mentions \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\", which would be Co(SCN)2. So I need to find the concentration of Co(SCN)2 relative to all cobalt species.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is the sum of all cobalt species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-]. The thiocyanate concentration is given as 0.1 M, but I need to check if that's the free concentration or the total. Wait, the problem says \"[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". Hmm, usually in such problems, if they give the concentration of a ligand, unless specified otherwise, it's the total concentration. But thiocyanate is a ligand that can form complexes, so the free SCN^- concentration would be less than 0.1 M because some is bound in the complexes. Wait, but the problem states \"[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". Maybe they mean the free SCN^- concentration? That would make the problem easier. Wait, but if that's the case, then we can use the free ligand concentration directly. But I need to check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M.\" Hmm, \"the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". The square brackets usually denote concentration, so maybe they are specifying the equilibrium concentration of SCN^-? If that's the case, then [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. But that seems unlikely because adding Co(II) ions would complex with SCN^- and lower the free SCN^- concentration. Unless the solution is buffered with excess SCN^-? Wait, but 0.1 M SCN^- is quite high. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M. But the problem says \"[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\", which is ambiguous. If it's the total SCN^- concentration, then we have to account for the SCN^- bound in the complexes. If it's the free SCN^- concentration, then we can use it directly. The problem statement isn't entirely clear. Hmm. Wait, in the context of such problems, when they give the concentration of a ligand without specifying, sometimes they mean the total concentration. But here, since they specify \"total cobalt concentration\", maybe they are specifying the total SCN^- concentration as 0.1 M? But the way it's phrased is \"[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\", which could be either. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let's check the options. The answer is among 16.9%, 42.3%, 38.1%, 25.6%. If I proceed under the assumption that [SCN^-] is the free concentration, then perhaps the calculation is straightforward. Let's try that first.\n\nAssuming [SCN^-] = 0.1 M (free), then we can compute the concentrations of each complex using the stability constants.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is:\n\n[Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)+] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^-] + [Co(SCN)4^2-] = 0.01 M.\n\nEach complex concentration can be expressed in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-]:\n\n[Co(SCN)+] = \u03b21 [Co^2+][SCN^-] = 9 * [Co^2+] * 0.1\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 = 40 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = \u03b23 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 = 63 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2-] = \u03b24 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 = 16 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^4\n\nSo total cobalt concentration is:\n\n[Co^2+] + 9*0.1*[Co^2+] + 40*(0.1)^2*[Co^2+] + 63*(0.1)^3*[Co^2+] + 16*(0.1)^4*[Co^2+] = 0.01 M\n\nFactor out [Co^2+]:\n\n[Co^2+] * [1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016] = 0.01\n\nCompute the sum inside the brackets:\n\n1 + 0.9 = 1.9\n\n1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3\n\n2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363\n\n2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nSo [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.004228 M\n\nThen, the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is:\n\n40 * [Co^2+] * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004228 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.004228 * 0.01\n\nWait, 0.1 squared is 0.01, so:\n\n40 * 0.004228 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.00004228 = 0.0016912 M\n\nTotal cobalt is 0.01 M, so the percentage is (0.0016912 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.912%, which is approximately 16.9%. So answer A. But wait, the options have 16.9% as option A. But wait, the problem says \"percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\", which is Co(SCN)2. So according to this calculation, the answer is 16.9%, option A. But let me check again.\n\nWait, but hold on. If [SCN^-] is 0.1 M as free concentration, then this calculation is correct. But if [SCN^-] is the total concentration, then we need to account for the SCN^- consumed in the complexes. Let's check that possibility.\n\nIf the total SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M, then:\n\nTotal SCN^- = [SCN^-]free + [Co(SCN)+] + 2[Co(SCN)2] + 3[Co(SCN)3^-] + 4[Co(SCN)4^2-] = 0.1 M\n\nBut in this case, the problem becomes more complicated because [SCN^-]free is unknown and we have to solve for it. Let's see if that's feasible.\n\nLet\u2019s denote [Co^2+] as x. Then:\n\n[Co(SCN)+] = \u03b21 x [SCN] = 9 x [SCN]\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x [SCN]^2 = 40 x [SCN]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = \u03b23 x [SCN]^3 = 63 x [SCN]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2-] = \u03b24 x [SCN]^4 = 16 x [SCN]^4\n\nTotal cobalt concentration:\n\nx + 9x[SCN] + 40x[SCN]^2 + 63x[SCN]^3 + 16x[SCN]^4 = 0.01\n\nTotal SCN^-:\n\n[SCN] + 9x[SCN] + 2*40x[SCN]^2 + 3*63x[SCN]^3 + 4*16x[SCN]^4 = 0.1\n\nThis seems complicated because we have two equations with two variables x and [SCN]. But solving this system might be necessary if the problem assumes total SCN^- is 0.1 M. However, this would require solving a system of nonlinear equations, which is more complex. Let's see if we can approximate.\n\nAssuming that the concentration of SCN^- is much larger than the amount consumed by the complexes, then [SCN] \u2248 0.1 M. Then, proceed as before. But given that the total cobalt is 0.01 M, and each complex can consume up to 4 SCN^- per Co, the maximum SCN consumed would be 0.01*4 = 0.04 M. But total SCN is 0.1 M, so 0.04/0.1 = 40% consumption, which is significant. Therefore, the assumption that [SCN] \u2248 0.1 M might not hold. Therefore, we need to solve the system properly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote [SCN] = y. Then:\n\nTotal cobalt:\n\nx(1 + 9y + 40y\u00b2 + 63y\u00b3 + 16y\u2074) = 0.01 ...(1)\n\nTotal SCN:\n\ny + x(9y + 2*40y\u00b2 + 3*63y\u00b3 + 4*16y\u2074) = 0.1 ...(2)\n\nThis is a system of equations in x and y. Let's try to express x from equation (1):\n\nx = 0.01 / (1 + 9y + 40y\u00b2 + 63y\u00b3 + 16y\u2074)\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\ny + [0.01 / (1 + 9y + 40y\u00b2 + 63y\u00b3 + 16y\u2074)] * (9y + 80y\u00b2 + 189y\u00b3 + 64y\u2074) = 0.1\n\nThis equation is quite complex. Solving it algebraically would be difficult. Maybe we can use an iterative approach or approximation.\n\nLet\u2019s first assume that y \u2248 0.1 M (as a first guess). Then compute x:\n\nDenominator D = 1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4\n\nCalculate:\n\n1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nSo x = 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.004228 M\n\nThen substitute into equation (2):\n\ny + 0.004228*(9*0.1 + 80*(0.1)^2 + 189*(0.1)^3 + 64*(0.1)^4) = 0.1\n\nCompute the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n9*0.1 = 0.9\n\n80*(0.1)^2 = 80*0.01 = 0.8\n\n189*(0.1)^3 = 189*0.001 = 0.189\n\n64*(0.1)^4 = 64*0.0001 = 0.0064\n\nSum: 0.9 + 0.8 + 0.189 + 0.0064 = 1.8954\n\nMultiply by x: 0.004228 * 1.8954 \u2248 0.00801\n\nSo equation (2) becomes:\n\ny + 0.00801 \u2248 0.1 => y \u2248 0.1 - 0.00801 \u2248 0.09199 M\n\nSo the free SCN^- is approximately 0.092 M instead of 0.1 M. Let's use this new y value (0.092) to recalculate x.\n\nCompute denominator D with y=0.092:\n\n1 + 9*0.092 + 40*(0.092)^2 + 63*(0.092)^3 + 16*(0.092)^4\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n9*0.092 = 0.828\n\n40*(0.092)^2 = 40*0.008464 = 0.33856\n\n63*(0.092)^3 = 63*(0.000778688) \u2248 0.04906\n\n16*(0.092)^4 \u2248 16*(0.00007158) \u2248 0.001145\n\nSum: 1 + 0.828 + 0.33856 + 0.04906 + 0.001145 \u2248 2.2168\n\nSo x = 0.01 / 2.2168 \u2248 0.00451 M\n\nNow substitute into equation (2):\n\ny + x*(9y + 80y\u00b2 + 189y\u00b3 + 64y\u2074)\n\nCompute each term with y=0.092:\n\n9y = 0.828\n\n80y\u00b2 = 80*(0.092)^2 \u2248 80*0.008464 \u2248 0.67712\n\n189y\u00b3 \u2248 189*(0.092)^3 \u2248 189*0.000778688 \u2248 0.14717\n\n64y\u2074 \u2248 64*(0.092)^4 \u2248 64*0.00007158 \u2248 0.00458\n\nSum: 0.828 + 0.67712 + 0.14717 + 0.00458 \u2248 1.65687\n\nMultiply by x: 0.00451 * 1.65687 \u2248 0.00747\n\nSo equation (2): y + 0.00747 = 0.1 => y \u2248 0.09253 M\n\nSo y is approximately 0.0925 M. Let's iterate again with y=0.0925.\n\nCompute denominator D:\n\n1 + 9*0.0925 + 40*(0.0925)^2 + 63*(0.0925)^3 + 16*(0.0925)^4\n\nCalculate:\n\n9*0.0925 = 0.8325\n\n40*(0.0925)^2 = 40*(0.008556) \u2248 0.34225\n\n63*(0.0925)^3 \u2248 63*(0.0007921) \u2248 0.0499\n\n16*(0.0925)^4 \u2248 16*(0.0000732) \u2248 0.001171\n\nSum: 1 + 0.8325 + 0.34225 + 0.0499 + 0.001171 \u2248 2.2258\n\nx = 0.01 / 2.2258 \u2248 0.004493 M\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\nCompute terms:\n\n9y = 0.8325\n\n80y\u00b2 = 80*(0.0925)^2 \u2248 80*0.008556 \u2248 0.6845\n\n189y\u00b3 \u2248 189*(0.0925)^3 \u2248 189*0.0007921 \u2248 0.150\n\n64y\u2074 \u2248 64*(0.0925)^4 \u2248 64*0.0000732 \u2248 0.00468\n\nSum: 0.8325 + 0.6845 + 0.150 + 0.00468 \u2248 1.67168\n\nMultiply by x: 0.004493 * 1.67168 \u2248 0.00752\n\nThus, y \u2248 0.1 - 0.00752 \u2248 0.09248 M\n\nSo after two iterations, y converges to approximately 0.0925 M. Let's take y \u2248 0.0925 M and x \u2248 0.00449 M.\n\nNow, compute the concentration of Co(SCN)2:\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 x y\u00b2 = 40 * 0.00449 * (0.0925)^2\n\nFirst compute (0.0925)^2 \u2248 0.008556\n\nThen 40 * 0.00449 * 0.008556 \u2248 40 * 0.00003845 \u2248 0.001538 M\n\nTotal cobalt is 0.01 M, so percentage is (0.001538 / 0.01) * 100 \u2248 15.38%. Hmm, this is lower than the previous estimate of 16.9%. But none of the answer options is 15.38%. Wait, maybe I need to do more accurate calculations.\n\nWait, let's compute more precisely. Let's use y=0.0925 M and x=0.01 / (1 + 9*0.0925 + 40*(0.0925)^2 + 63*(0.0925)^3 + 16*(0.0925)^4)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n9*0.0925 = 0.8325\n\n40*(0.0925)^2 = 40*(0.0925*0.0925) = 40*0.008555625 = 0.342225\n\n63*(0.0925)^3 = 63*(0.0925*0.0925*0.0925) = 63*(0.000792121) \u2248 0.0499036\n\n16*(0.0925)^4 = 16*(0.000792121*0.0925) \u2248 16*(0.00007327) \u2248 0.0011723\n\nSum: 1 + 0.8325 + 0.342225 + 0.0499036 + 0.0011723 \u2248 2.2258\n\nSo x = 0.01 / 2.2258 \u2248 0.0044927 M\n\nThen [Co(SCN)2] = 40 * 0.0044927 * (0.0925)^2\n\nCompute (0.0925)^2 = 0.008555625\n\nMultiply by 0.0044927: 0.0044927 * 0.008555625 \u2248 0.00003845\n\nMultiply by 40: 0.00003845 * 40 \u2248 0.001538 M\n\nPercentage: (0.001538 / 0.01) * 100 \u2248 15.38%. Still not matching any of the options. The closest option is A. 16.9%, but that was under the assumption that [SCN^-] is free. However, when considering the total SCN^- concentration, the percentage drops to ~15.4%, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that [SCN^-] is the free concentration, not the total. That would make the answer 16.9%, option A. But why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the stability constants. Let me check the definitions again. The stability constants \u03b2n are cumulative, meaning:\n\n\u03b21 = [Co(SCN)+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-])\n\n\u03b22 = [Co(SCN)2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2)\n\nand so on. So if [SCN^-] is the free concentration, then the initial calculation holds. However, if [SCN^-] is the total concentration, then we need to adjust. But according to the problem statement, it says \"[SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M\". In chemical terms, when specifying the concentration of a species in square brackets, it usually refers to the equilibrium (free) concentration. Therefore, maybe the problem is giving [SCN^-] as 0.1 M, meaning the free concentration. Therefore, the first calculation is correct, leading to 16.9%, option A.\n\nBut the answer options include 38.1% which is option C. Maybe I messed up the calculation. Wait, let's recalculate with [SCN^-] = 0.1 M (free):\n\nTotal cobalt species:\n\n[Co^2+] (1 + 9*0.1 + 40*(0.1)^2 + 63*(0.1)^3 + 16*(0.1)^4) = 0.01 M\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\n1 (for Co^2+)\n\n9*0.1 = 0.9 (for Co(SCN)+)\n\n40*(0.1)^2 = 40*0.01 = 0.4 (for Co(SCN)2)\n\n63*(0.1)^3 = 63*0.001 = 0.063 (for Co(SCN)3^-)\n\n16*(0.1)^4 = 16*0.0001 = 0.0016 (for Co(SCN)4^2-)\n\nSum: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646\n\nTherefore, [Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.004228 M\n\nThen, [Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 = 40 * 0.004228 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004228 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.00004228 = 0.0016912 M\n\nPercentage: (0.0016912 / 0.01) * 100 = 16.912%, which is approximately 16.9%, option A. So this seems correct.\n\nBut why is there an option C. 38.1%? Maybe I misunderstood the stability constants. Wait, sometimes stability constants are given as stepwise constants (K1, K2, ...) instead of cumulative (\u03b2n). Let me check. The problem says \"stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16.\" So \u03b2n is the cumulative stability constant for the nth complex. So \u03b22 = [Co(SCN)2]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using logarithms or different units? Wait, stability constants are usually given in terms of log \u03b2? But the problem states \u03b21=9, which is a small number. For example, log \u03b21=9 would mean \u03b21=10^9, which is very large. But here, \u03b21=9, which is a small value, so they must be giving \u03b2 as the cumulative constant, not log \u03b2. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 16.9%. But the options include other values. Wait, let me check the problem statement again. Wait, the problem says \"the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species\". Dithiocyanato would be Co(SCN)2^0? So neutral complex. But in solution, Co^2+ with two SCN^- ligands would have a charge of 0? Yes, Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- \u2192 Co(SCN)2. So neutral complex. So the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is 40*[Co^2+]*[SCN^-]^2. Which we calculated as 0.0016912 M. Total cobalt is 0.01 M, so 16.9%. So answer A.\n\nBut why is option C 38.1%? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem's given stability constants? Let me check the values again. \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. Wait, \u03b24=16? That's lower than \u03b23=63. Usually, stability constants increase with each step, but sometimes they decrease after a certain point due to steric effects or other factors. So \u03b24 being lower than \u03b23 is possible. For example, maybe the fourth ligand is less stable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different notation where \u03b2n refers to the stepwise constant. For example, if \u03b21 is K1, \u03b22 is K1*K2, etc. But the problem says \"stability constants\", which usually refer to cumulative constants. If they were stepwise constants, the problem should specify. Let's check:\n\nIf \u03b21=9 is the first stepwise constant K1=9, \u03b22=40 is K2=40, \u03b23=63 is K3=63, \u03b24=16 is K4=16. Then the cumulative constants would be:\n\n\u03b21 (cumulative) = K1 =9\n\n\u03b22 (cumulative) = K1*K2 =9*40=360\n\n\u03b23 (cumulative) = K1*K2*K3=9*40*63=22680\n\n\u03b24 (cumulative) = K1*K2*K3*K4=9*40*63*16= 362880\n\nBut this would make the cumulative constants much larger, and the percentages would be different. But the problem states \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. So these must be cumulative constants. Otherwise, if they were stepwise, the numbers would be inconsistent (since cumulative constants multiply stepwise constants). Therefore, the original calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 16.9%. But let me check once more.\n\nWait, let's compute all the percentages:\n\n[Co^2+] = 0.01 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.004228 M (42.28% of total Co)\n\n[Co(SCN)+] = 9*0.1*0.004228 \u2248 0.003805 M (38.05%)\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = 40*0.01*0.004228 \u2248 0.001691 M (16.91%)\n\n[Co(SCN)3^-] = 63*0.001*0.004228 \u2248 0.000266 M (2.66%)\n\n[Co(SCN)4^2-] = 16*0.0001*0.004228 \u2248 0.00000676 M (0.0676%)\n\nAdding up: 42.28% + 38.05% + 16.91% + 2.66% + 0.0676% \u2248 100%. So the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is 16.91%, which is answer A. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 16.9%.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes\". Maybe there are multiple dithiocyanato complexes? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the complex charges? Let me check.\n\nCobalt(II) has a +2 charge. Each thiocyanate is -1. So:\n\nCo^2+ + 1 SCN^- \u2192 Co(SCN)^+ (charge +1), \u03b21=9\n\nCo^2+ + 2 SCN^- \u2192 Co(SCN)2 (charge 0), \u03b22=40\n\nCo^2+ + 3 SCN^- \u2192 Co(SCN)3^- (charge -1), \u03b23=63\n\nCo^2+ + 4 SCN^- \u2192 Co(SCN)4^2- (charge -2), \u03b24=16\n\nSo the dithiocyanato complex is Co(SCN)2, which is neutral. The calculation seems correct. Therefore, the percentage is indeed approximately 16.9%, answer A.\n\nBut the given options include 38.1% as option C. Where could that come from? Wait, if someone mistakenly uses \u03b22 as the percentage instead of calculating, but \u03b22=40, which isn't 38.1. Alternatively, if they considered the concentration of Co(SCN)+, which is 38.05%, that's option B 42.3% is close to [Co^2+] 42.28%. So perhaps a miscalculation where someone thought the dominant species is Co(SCN)+, but according to the calculation, Co^2+ is 42.28%, Co(SCN)+ is 38.05%, Co(SCN)2 is 16.91%. So the answer should be A.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. 16.9%.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
