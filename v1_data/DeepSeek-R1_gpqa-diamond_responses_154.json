        "question": "Imagine an operator $\\vec{P}$ of a system have components $P_x, P_y$ and $P_z$. The matrix form of the  operator $P_x$ has components in the first row as $(0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(\\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,\\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.  The matrix form of the  operator $P_y$ has components in the first row as $(0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0)$, that in the second row as $(i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2}, 0, -i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2})$ and that in the third row as $(0,i \\hbar/\\sqrt{2},0)$.

        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the uncertainty in P_z for the given state. The uncertainty is defined as the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. So, \u0394P_z = \u221a(\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 - \u27e8P_z\u27e9\u00b2). \n\nFirst, let me recall the given information. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u210f. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that P_z is diagonal in this basis. Let me check the matrix for P_z provided.\n\nThe matrix for P_z has the first row as (\u210f, 0, 0), second row (0, 0, 0), third row (0, 0, -\u210f). So, yes, it's diagonal. Therefore, the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z with eigenvalues \u210f, 0, -\u210f for the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively. \n\nSo, the given state is a column vector \u03c8 = (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). To compute the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9, I need to compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8. Similarly, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 would be \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z\u00b2 will also be diagonal, with the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. Let me verify that.\n\nFirst, let's compute \u27e8P_z\u27e9. The state vector is:\n\n\u03c8 = [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]^T\n\nSo, \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]\n\nMultiplying \u03c8\u2020 by P_z:\n\nFirst, P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries (\u210f, 0, -\u210f). So, when we multiply \u03c8\u2020 by P_z, we get:\n\n[ -1/2 * \u210f, 1/\u221a2 * 0, -1/2 * (-\u210f) ] = [ -\u210f/2, 0, \u210f/2 ]\n\nThen, multiplying this by \u03c8 (which is the column vector), we get:\n\n(-\u210f/2)(-1/2) + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (\u210f/2)(-1/2) = (\u210f/4) + 0 - \u210f/4 = 0\n\nSo, \u27e8P_z\u27e9 = 0. That simplifies things because the uncertainty will just be \u221a\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9.\n\nNow, let's compute \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9. First, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal entry. So, P_z\u00b2 would be:\n\n[ \u210f\u00b2, 0, 0;\n\n0, 0, 0;\n\n0, 0, \u210f\u00b2 ]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of P_z are \u210f, 0, -\u210f. So, squaring them gives \u210f\u00b2, 0, \u210f\u00b2. Therefore, P_z\u00b2 is a diagonal matrix with entries (\u210f\u00b2, 0, \u210f\u00b2). \n\nSo, \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is:\n\nFirst, \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]\n\nMultiply by P_z\u00b2:\n\n[ -1/2 * \u210f\u00b2, 1/\u221a2 * 0, -1/2 * \u210f\u00b2 ] = [ -\u210f\u00b2/2, 0, -\u210f\u00b2/2 ]\n\nThen multiply by \u03c8:\n\n(-\u210f\u00b2/2)(-1/2) + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (-\u210f\u00b2/2)(-1/2) = (\u210f\u00b2/4) + 0 + (\u210f\u00b2/4) = \u210f\u00b2/2\n\nTherefore, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 = \u210f\u00b2/2. Then, the uncertainty \u0394P_z is \u221a(\u210f\u00b2/2 - 0) = \u210f/\u221a2. So, the answer should be option C: \u210f/\u221a2.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me verify the multiplication steps.\n\nFirst, \u27e8P_z\u27e9:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 P_z \u03c8:\n\nFirst component: (-1/2)*\u210f*(-1/2) = (1/4)\u210f\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*0*(1/\u221a2) = 0\n\nThird component: (-1/2)*(-\u210f)*(-1/2) = (-1/2)*(\u210f/2) = -\u210f/4\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, \u03c8 is a column vector [ -1/2; 1/\u221a2; -1/2 ]\n\nSo, \u03c8\u2020 is [ -1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2 ]\n\nMultiplying \u03c8\u2020 by P_z:\n\nFirst entry: (-1/2)*\u210f = -\u210f/2\n\nSecond entry: (1/\u221a2)*0 = 0\n\nThird entry: (-1/2)*(-\u210f) = \u210f/2\n\nSo, \u03c8\u2020 P_z is [ -\u210f/2, 0, \u210f/2 ]\n\nThen, multiplying by \u03c8:\n\n(-\u210f/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (\u210f/2)*(-1/2) = (\u210f/4) + 0 - \u210f/4 = 0. Correct.\n\nNow, \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9:\n\n\u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8:\n\nFirst, P_z\u00b2 is diagonal with entries \u210f\u00b2, 0, \u210f\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 is [ (-1/2)*\u210f\u00b2, (1/\u221a2)*0, (-1/2)*\u210f\u00b2 ] = [ -\u210f\u00b2/2, 0, -\u210f\u00b2/2 ]\n\nThen, multiplying by \u03c8:\n\n(-\u210f\u00b2/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/\u221a2) + (-\u210f\u00b2/2)*(-1/2) = (\u210f\u00b2/4) + 0 + (\u210f\u00b2/4) = \u210f\u00b2/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, \u0394P_z = \u221a(\u210f\u00b2/2) = \u210f/\u221a2. So, answer C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if P_z squared is indeed diagonal with entries \u210f\u00b2, 0, \u210f\u00b2. Because P_z is diagonal with entries \u210f, 0, -\u210f. So squaring each entry gives \u210f\u00b2, 0, \u210f\u00b2. So yes, P_z\u00b2 is diagonal with those entries. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute P_z\u00b2 explicitly as a matrix multiplication. But since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So, yes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 by expanding the matrix multiplication. Let's see:\n\nThe state vector \u03c8 is:\n\n-1/2\n\n1/\u221a2\n\n-1/2\n\nSo, P_z\u00b2 is:\n\n[ \u210f\u00b2 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 \u210f\u00b2 ]\n\nTherefore, P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is:\n\n[ \u210f\u00b2*(-1/2), 0*(1/\u221a2), \u210f\u00b2*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -\u210f\u00b2/2, 0, -\u210f\u00b2/2 ]^T\n\nThen, \u03c8\u2020 P_z\u00b2 \u03c8 is:\n\n(-1/2)(-\u210f\u00b2/2) + (1/\u221a2)(0) + (-1/2)(-\u210f\u00b2/2) = (\u210f\u00b2/4) + 0 + (\u210f\u00b2/4) = \u210f\u00b2/2. Same result.\n\nSo, yes, the uncertainty is \u210f/\u221a2. So, answer C.\n\nBut wait, let me check again if I didn't mix up anything. The state is given as an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -\u210f. The question is about the uncertainty in P_z. Since the state is not an eigenstate of P_z (unless it's one of the basis states, but here the state is a combination of the basis states), the uncertainty should be non-zero. The calculation shows that \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is zero, and \u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is \u210f\u00b2/2, so uncertainty is \u210f/\u221a2, which is answer C. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the components. Let me check the components again. The state vector is (-1/2, 1/\u221a2, -1/2). So, squared magnitudes of the components are (1/4, 1/2, 1/4). Sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So, normalized. Good.\n\nSo, probabilities for P_z are:\n\nFor eigenvalue \u210f (first component): | -1/2 |\u00b2 = 1/4\n\nFor eigenvalue 0 (second component): |1/\u221a2|\u00b2 = 1/2\n\nFor eigenvalue -\u210f (third component): | -1/2 |\u00b2 = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the expectation value \u27e8P_z\u27e9 is (1/4)*\u210f + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-\u210f) = (\u210f/4 - \u210f/4) = 0. Correct.\n\n\u27e8P_z\u00b2\u27e9 is (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*\u210f\u00b2 = (\u210f\u00b2/4 + \u210f\u00b2/4) = \u210f\u00b2/2. So, same result. Therefore, \u0394P_z = \u221a(\u210f\u00b2/2) = \u210f/\u221a2. So, answer C.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}"
