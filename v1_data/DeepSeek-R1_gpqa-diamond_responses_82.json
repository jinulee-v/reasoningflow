        "response": "Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. So, we have 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid diluted with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe after calculating, I can check which one matches. The Ka for acetic acid is 1.85\u00d710^-5. Alright, let's start step by step.\n\nFirst, when we dilute the acetic acid with an equal volume of water, the concentration will change. The original concentration is 0.05 M, and the volume doubles from 20 cm\u00b3 to 40 cm\u00b3. Since dilution is C1V1 = C2V2, the new concentration should be (0.05 M * 20 cm\u00b3) / 40 cm\u00b3 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M. Got that.\n\nNow, moving on to titration. The first part is 25% titration. Let me recall what 25% titration means. If 25% of the acid has been neutralized by the base, then we have a buffer solution consisting of acetic acid and its conjugate base, sodium acetate. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). \n\nBut wait, maybe I should first calculate how much NaOH is added at 25% titration. Let's see. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's compute the moles of acetic acid initially. Original moles before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, but after dilution, the moles remain the same, right? Because dilution doesn't change the number of moles, just the concentration. So moles of acetic acid are still 0.001 moles in 40 cm\u00b3 (0.04 L). So at equivalence, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3. So equivalence point is at 10 cm\u00b3 of NaOH added.\n\nBut the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. 25% of 10 cm\u00b3 is 2.5 cm\u00b3. So when 2.5 cm\u00b3 of NaOH is added, that's 25% titration. Let me confirm: 25% titration means 25% of the required amount to reach equivalence has been added. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo moles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio: CH3COOH + NaOH \u2192 CH3COO-Na+ + H2O. So the moles of acetic acid remaining will be initial moles - moles of NaOH added: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO-) formed will be 0.00025 moles. The total volume of the solution now is initial 40 cm\u00b3 + 2.5 cm\u00b3 = 42.5 cm\u00b3 = 0.0425 L.\n\nSo concentrations are: [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.01765 M, [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.00588 M. Then using Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). Let's compute pKa: Ka is 1.85\u00d710^-5, so pKa = -log(1.85\u00d710^-5). Let me calculate that. log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so pKa \u2248 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. So pH = 4.733 + log(0.00588 / 0.01765). Let's compute the ratio: 0.00588 / 0.01765 \u2248 0.333. log(0.333) \u2248 -0.477. So pH \u2248 4.733 - 0.477 \u2248 4.256. Rounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 4.26. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 4.26; 8.52. So maybe that's the first part.\n\nNow, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to sodium acetate. The total volume is initial 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 NaOH = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L. The moles of acetate ion are 0.001 moles (since all the acetic acid is converted). So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO- + H2O \u21cc CH3COOH + OH-. The pH will be greater than 7.\n\nTo calculate the pH, we need the Kb of acetate. Kb = Kw / Ka = 1\u00d710^-14 / 1.85\u00d710^-5 \u2248 5.41\u00d710^-10. Then, the concentration of OH- can be found using the formula for weak bases: Kb = [OH-]^2 / C, where C is the concentration of the base. So [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.41\u00d710^-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.082\u00d710^-11) \u2248 1.04\u00d710^-5. Then, pOH = -log(1.04\u00d710^-5) \u2248 5.0 - log(1.04) \u2248 5.0 - 0.017 \u2248 4.983. So pH = 14 - pOH \u2248 14 - 4.983 = 9.017. Wait, that's around 9.02. But none of the options have 9.02. The closest is option C: 8.52. Hmm, discrepancy here. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me compute that exactly. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 \u2248 0.5405 * 1e-9 \u2248 5.405e-10. Then Kb = 5.405e-10. Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So [OH-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5. So pOH is about 5 - log(1.04) \u2248 5 - 0.017 = 4.983. pH = 14 - 4.983 = 9.017. Hmm, but the answer options have 8.52. Maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise formula. The approximation [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C) is valid when Kb is very small and C is not too dilute. Here, Kb is 5.4e-10 and C is 0.02 M. Let's check if the approximation holds. If x = [OH-], then Kb = x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.02. Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation is valid. So the calculation should be correct. But according to this, pH is around 9.02, but the answer option C says 8.52. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again. Wait, when we dilute the acetic acid with 20 cm\u00b3 water, making total volume 40 cm\u00b3, so concentration is 0.025 M. Then, moles of acetic acid is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, original moles before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, same moles, but volume 0.04 L, so concentration 0.025 M. Correct. Then equivalence point requires 0.001 moles NaOH. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm\u00b3. Correct. At equivalence, total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm\u00b3 = 0.05 L. Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.\n\nThen Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 \u2248 5.405e-10. Then [OH-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5. So pOH \u2248 4.983, pH \u2248 9.017. Hmm. But answer C is 8.52. Maybe the problem is that the Ka value given is 1.85e-5. Let me recalculate pKa. pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute this more accurately. log(1.85) = 0.2672, so pKa = 5 - 0.2672 = 4.7328. So pH at 25% titration was 4.7328 + log(0.00025/0.00075). Wait, hold on, earlier I converted moles to concentrations by dividing by 0.0425 L. So [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.01765 M. So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.01765 \u2248 0.333. log(0.333) \u2248 -0.477. So pH \u2248 4.7328 - 0.477 \u2248 4.2558 \u2248 4.26. So that's correct. So first pH is 4.26.\n\nBut the equivalence point pH calculation gives around 9.02, but option C says 8.52. Maybe I need to check if there's an error in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think. Wait, maybe the hydrolysis of acetate isn't the only factor? Or maybe activity coefficients? Probably not, since it's a basic question. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact formula for weak base hydrolysis.\n\nThe exact expression is Kb = [OH-]^2 / (C - [OH-]). If [OH-] is much smaller than C, we can approximate C - [OH-] \u2248 C. But let's test it. If [OH-] is 1.04e-5, and C is 0.02, then 0.02 - 1.04e-5 \u2248 0.01999, which is very close to 0.02. So the approximation is valid. So the calculation should be correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the value of Ka is different? Wait, the problem states Ka is 1.85x10^-5. Let me recalculate Kb. Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct. Then sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5. So pH is 9.02. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking at the options:\n\nA. 4.57; 6.92\n\nB. 3.17; 6.73\n\nC. 4.26; 8.52\n\nD. 4.73; 7.00\n\nSo the second pH in option C is 8.52. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I forgot to consider that when the acetate ion is in solution, it's concentration is 0.02 M, but maybe there is a dilution factor I missed? Wait, no. At equivalence point, total volume is 40 cm\u00b3 + 10 cm\u00b3 = 50 cm\u00b3. Moles of acetate is 0.001, so concentration is 0.02 M. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different formula. Let me recall that for the hydrolysis of the conjugate base:\n\nThe pH can be calculated using:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKw + pKa + log C)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. For a weak base, the pH is given by:\n\npH = 1/2 (pKw + pKa - log C)\n\nWait, let's derive it. For the acetate ion (A-), the hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nA- + H2O \u21cc HA + OH-\n\nKb = [HA][OH-]/[A-]\n\nAssuming [HA] \u2248 [OH-] \u2248 x, and [A-] \u2248 C - x \u2248 C.\n\nSo Kb \u2248 x\u00b2 / C \u2192 x = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\nThen [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\npOH = 1/2 (pKb - log C)\n\nBut pKb = pKw - pKa\n\nSo pOH = 1/2 (pKw - pKa - log C)\n\nThen pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1/2 (14 - pKa - log C) = 14 - 7 + 0.5 pKa + 0.5 log C = 7 + 0.5 pKa + 0.5 log C\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\npH = 7 + 0.5 * pKa + 0.5 * log C\n\nGiven pKa = 4.73, C = 0.02 M.\n\nSo pH = 7 + 0.5 * 4.73 + 0.5 * log(0.02)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n0.5 * 4.73 = 2.365\n\nlog(0.02) = log(2\u00d710^-2) = log(2) + log(10^-2) \u2248 0.3010 - 2 = -1.699\n\n0.5 * (-1.699) \u2248 -0.8495\n\nSo pH = 7 + 2.365 - 0.8495 \u2248 7 + 1.5155 \u2248 8.5155 \u2248 8.52\n\nOh! So this formula gives pH \u2248 8.52, which matches option C. But why did my initial calculation give 9.02? Because I used the approximation [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C), then found pOH and pH. But according to this formula, pH is 8.52. There's a contradiction here. Wait, let's check where the discrepancy is.\n\nWait, the formula pH = 7 + 0.5 pKa + 0.5 log C comes from rearranging the equations. Let me verify:\n\nStarting from [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C)\n\nThen pOH = -log([OH-]) = -0.5 log(Kb * C) = -0.5 (log Kb + log C)\n\nBut Kb = Kw / Ka \u2192 log Kb = log Kw - log Ka = -14 - log Ka\n\nSo pOH = -0.5 (-14 - log Ka + log C) = 0.5 (14 + log Ka - log C)\n\nThen pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 0.5 (14 + log Ka - log C) = 14 - 7 - 0.5 log Ka + 0.5 log C = 7 - 0.5 log Ka + 0.5 log C\n\nBut pKa = -log Ka \u2192 log Ka = -pKa\n\nSo pH = 7 - 0.5 (-pKa) + 0.5 log C = 7 + 0.5 pKa + 0.5 log C\n\nYes, that's correct. So pH = 7 + 0.5 pKa + 0.5 log C\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\npKa = 4.73 (from earlier calculation), log C = log(0.02) \u2248 -1.69897\n\nSo pH = 7 + 0.5*4.73 + 0.5*(-1.69897) \u2248 7 + 2.365 - 0.849 \u2248 7 + 1.516 \u2248 8.516 \u2248 8.52\n\nSo this formula gives pH \u2248 8.52, which matches option C. But why did the initial calculation using [OH-] = sqrt(Kb*C) give pH \u2248 9.02?\n\nWait, let's compute [OH-] again:\n\nKb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02 M\n\n[OH-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5 M\n\npOH = -log(1.04e-5) \u2248 4.983\n\npH = 14 - 4.983 \u2248 9.017\n\nBut according to the formula, pH \u2248 8.52. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula pH = 7 + 0.5 pKa + 0.5 log C is an approximation, whereas the [OH-] calculation is more accurate? Let me check with exact calculation.\n\nLet me consider the exact expression:\n\nKb = [OH-]^2 / (C - [OH-])\n\nWe have Kb = 5.405e-10, C = 0.02 M\n\nLet [OH-] = x\n\nSo equation: x\u00b2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10\n\nAssuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x \u2248 0.02\n\nThen x\u00b2 \u2248 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 \u2192 x \u2248 1.04e-5\n\nBut let's do it without approximation:\n\nx\u00b2 = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x)\n\nx\u00b2 + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n\nDiscriminant: b\u00b2 - 4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 - 4*1*(-1.081e-11) \u2248 2.92e-19 + 4.324e-11 \u2248 4.324e-11 (since 4.324e-11 is much larger than 2.92e-19)\n\nSo sqrt(4.324e-11) \u2248 6.576e-6\n\nThus, x = [-5.405e-10 \u00b1 6.576e-6]/2\n\nTaking the positive root:\n\nx = ( -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ) / 2 \u2248 (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 \u2248 6.5755e-6 / 2 \u2248 3.287e-6\n\nWait, that's different. Wait, hold on, sqrt(4.324e-11) is sqrt(4.324\u00d710^-11) = sqrt(4.324)\u00d710^-5.5 \u2248 2.08\u00d710^-5.5 \u2248 2.08\u00d710^-5.5 \u2248 6.57\u00d710^-6. Wait, no:\n\nWait, sqrt(4.324e-11) = sqrt(4.324)*1e-5.5 \u2248 2.08 * 1e-5.5 \u2248 2.08 / 1e5.5 \u2248 2.08 / 3.16e5 \u2248 6.58e-6. Yes, correct.\n\nSo x \u2248 ( -5.405e-10 + 6.58e-6 ) / 2 \u2248 (6.58e-6 - 5.405e-10)/2 \u2248 approximately 6.58e-6 / 2 \u2248 3.29e-6. So [OH-] \u2248 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.29e-6) \u2248 5.483, pH = 14 - 5.483 \u2248 8.517 \u2248 8.52. Ah! So the exact calculation gives pH \u2248 8.52, which matches the formula. So my initial approximation was wrong because I incorrectly calculated the square root. Wait, sqrt(1.081e-11) is sqrt(1.081)*1e-5.5 \u2248 1.04 * 1e-5.5 \u2248 1.04 / 1e5.5 \u2248 1.04 / 3.16e5 \u2248 3.29e-6. Wait, no, sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) \u2248 1.04 * 1e-5.5 \u2248 1.04 * 3.16e-6 \u2248 3.29e-6. So [OH-] is 3.29e-6, pOH \u2248 5.48, pH \u2248 8.52. So I messed up the initial sqrt calculation. Instead of sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 1.04e-5, it's actually \u2248 3.29e-6. That was my mistake. Probably confused the exponent. Because 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5 \u2248 3.16e-6. So sqrt(1.081e-11) \u2248 3.29e-6. Therefore, [OH-] \u2248 3.29e-6, pOH \u2248 5.48, pH \u2248 8.52. So that's correct. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, matching option C. So the answer is C: 4.26; 8.52.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{C}"

But answer C is 8.52. Maybe the problem is that the Ka value given is 1.85e-5. Let me recalculate pKa. pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute this more accurately. log(1.85) = 0.2672, so pKa = 5 - 0.2672 = 4.7328. So pH at 25% titration was 4.7328 + log(0.00025/0.00075). Wait, hold on, earlier I converted moles to concentrations by dividing by 0.0425 L. So [A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.005882 M, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 \u2248 0.01765 M.
