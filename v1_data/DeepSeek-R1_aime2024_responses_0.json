        "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where we have three equations involving logarithms of ratios of x, y, z, and then find the absolute value of log base 2 of x^4 y^3 z^2. The answer should be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let's start by understanding what's given.\n\nFirst, the equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nAnd we need to find |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|.\n\nHmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe converting them into exponential form would help. Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\nlog\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2 \u21d2 2^(1/2) = x/(yz) \u21d2 x/(yz) = \u221a2.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation:\n\nlog\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3 \u21d2 2^(1/3) = y/(xz) \u21d2 y/(xz) = 2^(1/3).\n\nThird equation:\n\nlog\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4 \u21d2 2^(1/4) = z/(xy) \u21d2 z/(xy) = 2^(1/4).\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. x = yz * 2^(1/2)\n2. y = xz * 2^(1/3)\n3. z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nThese are three equations with three variables. So maybe I can substitute them into each other to solve for x, y, z.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation (1): x = yz * 2^(1/2)\n\nEquation (2): y = xz * 2^(1/3)\n\nEquation (3): z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nSo perhaps substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2), then substitute the resulting expression into equation (3), and so on. Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation (1): x = yz * 2^(1/2). Let's plug this into equation (2):\n\ny = (yz * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3) = y z^2 * 2^(1/2 + 1/3)\n\nWait, so:\n\ny = y z^2 * 2^(1/2 + 1/3)\n\nLet me compute 1/2 + 1/3. That's 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So:\n\ny = y z^2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nAssuming y \u2260 0 (which it isn't, since x, y, z are positive reals), we can divide both sides by y:\n\n1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)\n\nTherefore:\n\nz^2 = 2^(-5/6) \u21d2 z = 2^(-5/12) [since z is positive]\n\nWait, but let's check that. If z^2 = 2^(-5/6), then z = 2^(-5/12). Hmm. Let's note that.\n\nSo z = 2^(-5/12). Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's substitute z into equation (1) to find x in terms of y.\n\nFrom equation (1): x = yz * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/2)\n\nSince 2^(1/2) is 2^(6/12), so:\n\nx = y * 2^(-5/12 + 6/12) = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's substitute z and x into equation (3) to find y.\n\nEquation (3): z = xy * 2^(1/4)\n\nWe have z = 2^(-5/12), x = y * 2^(1/12). So substituting:\n\n2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= y^2 * 2^(1/12 + 1/4)\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12:\n\n= y^2 * 2^(1/12 + 3/12) = y^2 * 2^(4/12) = y^2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nTherefore:\n\n2^(-5/12) = y^2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/3):\n\ny^2 = 2^(-5/12 - 1/3)\n\nConvert 1/3 to 4/12:\n\ny^2 = 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(-3/8) [since y is positive]\n\nSo y = 2^(-3/8). Then, from earlier, x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12)\n\nConvert exponents to common denominator. Let's use 24 as denominator:\n\n-3/8 = -9/24\n\n1/12 = 2/24\n\nSo x = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24)\n\nTherefore, x = 2^(-7/24)\n\nSimilarly, z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, let me check that exponent again. z was found to be 2^(-5/12). Let's confirm:\n\nFrom equation (2): 1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6) \u21d2 z^2 = 2^(-5/6) \u21d2 z = 2^(-5/12). Yes, correct.\n\nSo z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nSo now we have:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24)\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait, 3/8 is 9/24, so -3/8 is -9/24. 5/12 is 10/24, so -5/12 is -10/24. And 7/24 is just 7/24. So x is 2^(-7/24), y is 2^(-9/24), z is 2^(-10/24). Hmm. Interesting.\n\nSo now, we need to compute |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|.\n\nFirst, let's compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let's break it down:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074) + log\u2082(y\u00b3) + log\u2082(z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082(x) + 3 log\u2082(y) + 2 log\u2082(z)\n\nWe already have log\u2082(x), log\u2082(y), log\u2082(z):\n\nlog\u2082(x) = -7/24\n\nlog\u2082(y) = -9/24\n\nlog\u2082(z) = -10/24\n\nTherefore:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-9/24) + 2*(-10/24)\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24\n\n3*(-9/24) = (-27)/24\n\n2*(-10/24) = (-20)/24\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: (-25)/8\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8\n\nTaking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8\n\nSo the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime. Therefore, m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.\n\nWait, let me verify this step-by-step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, converting the logs to exponential form:\n\n1. x/(yz) = 2^(1/2)\n\n2. y/(xz) = 2^(1/3)\n\n3. z/(xy) = 2^(1/4)\n\nThen expressing x, y, z in terms of each other:\n\nFrom equation 1: x = yz * 2^(1/2)\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: y = (yz * 2^(1/2)) * z * 2^(1/3) = y z\u00b2 * 2^(1/2 + 1/3)\n\nSimplify exponents: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6, so 2^(5/6)\n\nThus, 1 = z\u00b2 * 2^(5/6) \u21d2 z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6) \u21d2 z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nThen x = y * z * 2^(1/2) = y * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(6/12) = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nSo x = y * 2^(1/12)\n\nThen equation 3: z = x y * 2^(1/4)\n\nSubstitute x and z:\n\n2^(-5/12) = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4) = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12 + 1/4)\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12: 1/12 + 3/12 = 4/12 = 1/3\n\nWait, hold on, 1/12 + 3/12 is 4/12, which is 1/3. Wait, but 1/3 is 8/24, but earlier I thought 1/12 + 1/4 is 1/12 + 3/12 = 4/12 = 1/3. So exponent is 1/3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I thought exponent was 1/3, but here, let's check:\n\nWait, equation 3 substitution:\n\nz = x y * 2^(1/4)\n\nBut x = y * 2^(1/12), so substituting:\n\nz = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4) = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12 + 1/4)\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12:\n\n1/12 + 3/12 = 4/12 = 1/3\n\nSo exponent is 1/3, so:\n\nz = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nBut z is also 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-5/12 - 1/3) = 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nThus, y = 2^(-3/8), which is 2^(-9/24). Correct.\n\nThen x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\nSo x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24). Simplify exponents:\n\n-7/24, -9/24, -10/24. So when we compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2):\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074) = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24\n\nlog\u2082(y\u00b3) = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24\n\nlog\u2082(z\u00b2) = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nAbsolute value is 25/8. So m = 25, n = 8, m + n = 33. Seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if substituting x, y, z back into original equations works.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2\n\nCompute x/(yz):\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-9/24)\n\nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nyz = 2^(-9/24 -10/24) = 2^(-19/24)\n\nx/(yz) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(-7/24 +19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2)\n\nSo log\u2082(2^(1/2)) = 1/2. Correct.\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y/(xz)) = 1/3\n\nCompute y/(xz):\n\ny = 2^(-9/24)\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nxz = 2^(-7/24 -10/24) = 2^(-17/24)\n\ny/(xz) = 2^(-9/24)/2^(-17/24) = 2^(-9/24 +17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3)\n\nlog\u2082(2^(1/3)) = 1/3. Correct.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(xy)) = 1/4\n\nCompute z/(xy):\n\nz = 2^(-10/24)\n\nx = 2^(-7/24)\n\ny = 2^(-9/24)\n\nxy = 2^(-7/24 -9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)\n\nz/(xy) = 2^(-10/24)/2^(-16/24) = 2^(-10/24 +16/24) = 2^(6/24) = 2^(1/4)\n\nlog\u2082(2^(1/4)) = 1/4. Correct.\n\nAll equations check out. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25/8, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}"

Wait, but 1/3 is 8/24, but earlier I thought 1/12 + 1/4 is 1/12 + 3/12 = 4/12 = 1/3. So exponent is 1/3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I thought exponent was 1/3, but here, let's check:\n\nWait, equation 3 substitution:\n\nz = x y * 2^(1/4)\n\nBut x = y * 2^(1/12), so substituting:\n\nz = (y * 2^(1/12)) * y * 2^(1/4) = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/12 + 1/4)\n\nConvert 1/4 to 3/12:\n\n1/12 + 3/12 = 4/12 = 1/3\n\nSo exponent is 1/3, so:\n\nz = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nBut z is also 2^(-5/12), so:\n\n2^(-5/12) = y\u00b2 * 2^(1/3)\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-5/12 - 1/3) = 2^(-5/12 - 4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nThus, y = 2^(-3/8), which is 2^(-9/24). Correct.\n\nThen x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-9/24 + 2/24) = 2^(-7/24). Correct.\n\nSo x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24). Simplify exponents:\n\n-7/24, -9/24, -10/24. So when we compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2):\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074) = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24\n\nlog\u2082(y\u00b3) = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24\n\nlog\u2082(z\u00b2) = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24\n\nTotal: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8\n\nAbsolute value is 25/8.
