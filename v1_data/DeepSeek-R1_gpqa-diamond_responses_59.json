The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years.  Now, having Earth as their destination in mind, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c, where c is the speed of light.

The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.\nB. 81 years\nC. 72 years\nD. 77 years",
        "response": "Okay, so there's this problem about an alien civilization sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft is super fast, moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to figure out how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective. The options are whether the astronaut dies before arriving (option A) or some number of years like 72, 77, 81, etc. The aliens have an average lifespan of 150 years, so if the trip takes longer than that, the astronaut might die en route.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some special relativity here. When something is moving close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That means the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) will be different from the time measured by an observer on Earth. The formula for time dilation is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Then, the proper time (tau) is equal to the Earth time divided by gamma. Or wait, actually, if the Earth time is t, then the astronaut's time would be t divided by gamma. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.\n\nThe time experienced by the astronaut would be shorter because from the Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock is running slower. But in this case, we need to calculate the astronaut's own experienced time. So if the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is known, then in the Earth frame, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. Then, the astronaut's time would be that time divided by gamma. But wait, gamma is greater than 1, so the astronaut's time is less. But since the speed is so high, maybe the distance is contracted in the astronaut's frame. So maybe we should use length contraction instead.\n\nRight, length contraction. In the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is shorter by a factor of gamma. So the proper distance (Earth's frame) is L, then the contracted distance is L / gamma. Then the time experienced by the astronaut would be (L / gamma) divided by v. Alternatively, since in the astronaut's frame, Earth is moving towards them at speed v, so the distance is contracted. So time is contracted distance divided by speed.\n\nBut first, I need to know the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, the problem doesn't give a distance. Hmm. Maybe I need to recall that the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and its distance is approximately about 163,000 light-years away. Wait, is that right? Let me check. From what I remember, the distance to the LMC is roughly 160,000 light-years. Let me confirm. Yes, according to current estimates, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 157,000 to 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Let's take 160,000 light-years as an approximate value.\n\nSo, distance L \u2248 160,000 light-years. Speed v = 0.99999987c. So from Earth's frame, the time taken would be t = L / v. Since v is very close to c, t \u2248 160,000 years. But since v is 0.99999987c, maybe we need to calculate it more precisely? Let's see. 0.99999987c is equal to (1 - 1.3e-7)c. So, 1 - v/c = 1.3e-7. Therefore, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) \u2248 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c)) when v is close to c. Wait, because 1 - (v/c)^2 = (1 - v/c)(1 + v/c) \u2248 2*(1 - v/c) when v is very close to c. So gamma \u2248 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - v/c)) = 1 / sqrt(2*1.3e-7) \u2248 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 1 / 0.0005099 \u2248 1960. So gamma is approximately 1960.\n\nTherefore, the time experienced by the astronaut would be t' = t / gamma \u2248 160,000 years / 1960 \u2248 81.63 years. So approximately 82 years. But the answer options are 72, 77, 81, etc. So 81 is option B or C? Wait, the options are A: die before reaching, B:81, C:72, D:77. So 81 is B. But wait, my calculation gives approximately 81.63, which is close to 81. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the exact gamma calculation is needed. Let's compute gamma more accurately. Given v = 0.99999987c. So beta = v/c = 0.99999987. Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). Let's compute 1 - beta^2. Beta squared is (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute that. Let me write beta as 1 - x, where x = 1.3e-7. So beta = 1 - x, so beta squared is (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x^2. Since x is 1.3e-7, x squared is negligible (1.69e-14). So beta squared \u2248 1 - 2x. Therefore, 1 - beta squared \u2248 2x = 2.6e-7. Therefore, gamma \u2248 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute sqrt(2.6e-7). sqrt(2.6) is approx 1.612, and sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 0.0003162. So sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 1.612 * 0.0003162 \u2248 0.0005099. Therefore, gamma \u2248 1 / 0.0005099 \u2248 1961. So gamma is approximately 1961.\n\nTherefore, t' = L / (gamma * v). Wait, but L is 160,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, time t = L / v \u2248 160,000 / 0.99999987 \u2248 160,000.016 years. So negligible difference. So t \u2248 160,000 years. Then, t' = t / gamma \u2248 160,000 / 1961 \u2248 81.59 years. So approximately 81.6 years. So answer B:81 years.\n\nBut wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. Their lifespan is 150 years. So 22 + 81.6 \u2248 103.6 years old upon arrival. So they would survive. Therefore, answer B:81 years. So the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I did the gamma calculation correctly. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using a different approximation. Let me check with exact calculation.\n\nCompute gamma:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2)\n\nbeta = 0.99999987\n\nbeta^2 = (0.99999987)^2\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n0.99999987 * 0.99999987\n\nLet me write 0.99999987 as 1 - 0.00000013\n\nSo (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169 \u2248 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974\n\nTherefore, 1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026 = 2.6e-7\n\nTherefore, gamma = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 1 / 0.0005099 \u2248 1961. So same as before.\n\nSo t' = 160,000 / 1961 \u2248 81.59 years. So approximately 82 years. But answer B is 81. Close enough. So answer B.\n\nBut wait, maybe the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is different? If the problem states \"approximate\", maybe the distance is approximated as 163,000 light-years? Let's check.\n\nIf L = 163,000 ly, then t' = 163000 / 1961 \u2248 83.1 years. Still closer to 81 or 83? Hmm. But maybe the actual distance is about 157,000 ly. Let's try 157,000 / 1961 \u2248 157000 / 2000 \u2248 78.5. Hmm, 78.5. That's closer to 77 or 81? Wait, 157,000 / 1961 \u2248 80.0. Wait, 1961 * 80 = 156,880. So 157,000 / 1961 \u2248 80.06. So 80 years. Hmm. But the answer options are 72,77,81, etc. So maybe the problem uses a different approximate distance?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed. Wait, the speed is 0.99999987c. Let me check if beta is 0.99999987, so 1 - beta = 1.3e-7. Then gamma is 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - beta)) = 1 / sqrt(2*1.3e-7) = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 1961. So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using gamma \u2248 1 / (sqrt(2*(1 - beta)))?\n\nWait, yes, because when beta is very close to 1, 1 - beta^2 \u2248 2*(1 - beta). So gamma \u2248 1 / sqrt(2*(1 - beta)) = 1 / sqrt(2*1.3e-7) \u2248 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 1961. So same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using a different formula? Wait, perhaps the astronaut's time is calculated using the length contraction formula. So in the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted by gamma, so L' = L / gamma. Then, the time is L' / v = (L / gamma) / v = L / (gamma v). Since v \u2248 c, L / (gamma c). But L is 160,000 ly, so L / c is 160,000 years. Then, dividing by gamma gives 160,000 / 1961 \u2248 81.6 years. Same result.\n\nTherefore, answer B:81 years. So the astronaut would be 22 + 81 = 103 years old, which is less than their lifespan of 150 years, so they survive. Therefore, answer B.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I messed up somewhere. Wait, gamma is approximately 1961, so time experienced is 160,000 / 1961 \u2248 81.6. So answer B:81. So correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering relativistic speeds and using the time dilation formula, but perhaps I need to use the velocity addition formula or something else? Wait, no. The problem is straightforward: from the astronaut's perspective, how long does the trip take? That's the proper time, which is calculated by taking the Earth's distance divided by gamma, then divided by speed. Alternatively, using the proper time formula: tau = t / gamma. Since t is Earth time, which is L / v. So tau = (L / v) / gamma = L / (gamma v). Which is same as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the invariant spacetime interval: ds^2 = (c t)^2 - L^2 = (c tau)^2. So (c tau)^2 = (c t)^2 - L^2. Therefore, tau = sqrt(t^2 - (L / c)^2). Wait, but t is L / v. So tau = sqrt( (L / v)^2 - (L / c)^2 ) = L / c * sqrt( (1 / (v/c)^2 ) - 1 ). Let's compute that.\n\nLet beta = v/c = 0.99999987. Then, tau = L / c * sqrt(1 / beta^2 - 1 ) = L / c * sqrt( (1 - beta^2 ) / beta^2 ) = L / c * sqrt(1 - beta^2 ) / beta. Which is same as L / (beta c gamma ). Since sqrt(1 - beta^2 ) = 1 / gamma. So tau = L / (beta c gamma ). Since beta is 0.99999987 \u2248 1, so tau \u2248 L / (c gamma ). Which is same as before. So tau \u2248 160,000 ly / (c * 1961 ). But 160,000 ly / c is 160,000 years. So tau \u2248 160,000 / 1961 \u2248 81.6 years. Same result.\n\nTherefore, answer B:81 years. So the astronaut will be 103 years old, which is under 150, so alive. Therefore, answer B.\n\nBut wait, the options are A. Die before reaching, B.81, C.72, D.77. So B is the answer. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with the distance. If the actual distance is less, then tau would be less. For example, if the distance is 157,000 ly, then tau is 157,000 / 1961 \u2248 80.0 years. Still, answer B is 81. Maybe the problem uses a rounded value. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.99999987c, which gives a gamma of 1961, but maybe the problem approximates gamma as 2000, leading to 160,000 / 2000 = 80. But 80 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different method. Wait, perhaps using the approximation for gamma when v is very close to c. There's an approximation formula for gamma when beta \u2248 1: gamma \u2248 1 / sqrt(2(1 - beta)). So given beta = 0.99999987, 1 - beta = 1.3e-7. Then gamma \u2248 1 / sqrt(2*1.3e-7) \u2248 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 1 / 0.0005099 \u2248 1961. Same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different value for the speed. Wait, 0.99999987c. Let me check what 1 - beta is. 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013, which is 1.3e-7. So gamma is 1 / sqrt(2*1.3e-7) \u2248 1961. So same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects using gamma =  c^2 / (v^2). Wait, no, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. If the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, then the time experienced by the astronaut is L * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) / v. Wait, that's same as L / (gamma v). So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different distance. Wait, maybe the Large Magellanic Cloud is 50 kpc away. Let's convert that. 1 parsec is about 3.26 light-years. So 50 kpc is 50,000 * 3.26 \u2248 163,000 ly. So same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses a different distance. Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is 160,000 light-years, but the answer options are approximate. So 81.6 is approximately 81, which is answer B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up gamma. Let me compute gamma again. Let's compute 1 - beta^2 = 1 - (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute 0.99999987 squared:\n\n0.99999987 * 0.99999987\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst, 1 - 0.00000013 is 0.99999987.\n\nSquaring this:\n\n(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2\n\n= 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169\n\n\u2248 1 - 0.00000026 = 0.99999974\n\nTherefore, 1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026 = 2.6e-7\n\nTherefore, gamma = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) \u2248 1 / 0.0005099 \u2248 1961. So same as before.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nSo the answer is B:81 years. Therefore, the astronaut would be 22 + 81 = 103 years old upon arrival, which is under their 150-year lifespan, so they survive. Therefore, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}"
