        "question": "Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let me start by jotting down all the given information to make sure I have everything straight.\n\nTotal residents: 900.\n\nNumber of residents owning each item:\n- Diamond ring (let's call this set D): 195\n- Golf clubs (G): 367\n- Garden spade (S): 562\n- Candy hearts (C): Since it says every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, that means everyone owns this, right? So that's 900.\n\nAdditional info:\n- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.\n- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.\n\nWe need to find the number who own all four, which is the intersection of D, G, S, and C. Since everyone owns C, the intersection of all four is the same as the intersection of D, G, and S. Because C is universal, so the overlap with C is just the overlap of the other three. Hmm, that might be helpful.\n\nI remember that in inclusion-exclusion problems, the total number is the sum of individual sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple intersections minus the quadruple intersection. But here, since we have some additional info about exactly two and exactly three, maybe we can use that?\n\nWait, let me recall the standard inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula is:\n\nTotal = |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D\u2229G| - |D\u2229S| - |D\u2229C| - |G\u2229S| - |G\u2229C| - |S\u2229C| + |D\u2229G\u2229S| + |D\u2229G\u2229C| + |D\u2229S\u2229C| + |G\u2229S\u2229C| - |D\u2229G\u2229S\u2229C|\n\nBut since everyone owns C, the union of all four sets is just the total population, which is 900. Wait, actually, since everyone owns C, the union of D, G, S, and C is just the entire population. So that formula would equal 900. But maybe that's not the most straightforward way here.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the number of people who own exactly two items and exactly three items, perhaps we can use a different approach. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote:\n- a = number of people who own exactly 1 item\n- b = number who own exactly 2 items = 437\n- c = number who own exactly 3 items = 234\n- d = number who own all 4 items = ?\n\nSince everyone owns at least the candy hearts, right? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So actually, everyone owns C. Therefore, every resident owns at least one item (the candy hearts). Therefore, the categories are:\n\n- People who own only C (so exactly 1 item)\n- People who own C plus one other item (so exactly 2 items)\n- People who own C plus two other items (exactly 3 items)\n- People who own C plus the other three items (all four items)\n\nTherefore, actually, the counts for exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 items are all subsets that include C. Wait, so in this case, the \"exactly two of these things\" must include C and one other, right? Because everyone has C. Wait, but the problem says \"exactly two of these things\"\u2014so since everyone has C, then the only way someone can have exactly two things is if they have C plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four is C plus the other three. So actually, the counts given (437 for exactly two and 234 for exactly three) are counts of people who have C plus one or two other items. Therefore, the total number of people is the sum of those who have only C, plus exactly two (C + one other), exactly three (C + two others), and exactly four (C + all three others). Since everyone has at least C, there's no one with none.\n\nTherefore, total residents = a (only C) + b (exactly two) + c (exactly three) + d (all four) = 900.\n\nWe know b = 437, c = 234, so:\n\na + 437 + 234 + d = 900\n\nTherefore, a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229. So a + d = 229. Hmm, okay, so if we can find another equation involving a and d, we can solve for d, which is the number we want.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the inclusion-exclusion formula. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the counts for each individual item. Since everyone has C, the count for C is 900. The counts for D, G, S are 195, 367, 562. Let me think of how these counts can be broken down.\n\nFor example, the number of people who own D is the number of people who own D and C (since everyone has C). So, the count for D is the number of people who own D and no others, plus those who own D and one other item (but since they must have C, that's D and C plus one more), plus those who own D and two others (so D, C, and two more), plus those who own all four. Wait, but actually, since D is only one of the items, the ownership of D can be broken down as:\n\nNumber of people who own D = (only D and C) + (D and exactly one other item besides C) + (D and exactly two other items besides C) + (all four items).\n\nWait, perhaps more systematically:\n\nThe total number of people who own D is equal to:\n\n- The number of people who own exactly D and C (so exactly two items: D and C)\n- Plus the number who own D, C, and one other item (so exactly three items)\n- Plus the number who own D, C, and the other two items (so all four items)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, for each of D, G, S, their counts can be expressed in terms of the \"exactly two\", \"exactly three\", and \"all four\" categories.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- x_{D} = number of people who own exactly D and C (so exactly two items)\n- x_{G} = exactly G and C\n- x_{S} = exactly S and C\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- y_{DG} = number of people who own exactly D, G, and C (so exactly three items)\n- y_{DS} = exactly D, S, and C\n- y_{GS} = exactly G, S, and C\n\nAnd then,\n\n- z = number of people who own all four items (D, G, S, C)\n\nThen, the total number of people who own exactly two items is x_D + x_G + x_S = 437\n\nThe total number who own exactly three items is y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS} = 234\n\nAnd the number who own all four is z.\n\nAdditionally, the number who own only C is a = 900 - (437 + 234 + z) = 900 - 671 - z = 229 - z, as before.\n\nNow, let's express the counts for each item:\n\nFor D:\n\nNumber of people who own D is:\n\nx_D (exactly D and C) +\n\ny_{DG} (exactly D, G, C) +\n\ny_{DS} (exactly D, S, C) +\n\nz (all four) =\n\n195\n\nSimilarly for G:\n\nx_G + y_{DG} + y_{GS} + z = 367\n\nAnd for S:\n\nx_S + y_{DS} + y_{GS} + z = 562\n\nSo we have three equations here:\n\n1. x_D + y_{DG} + y_{DS} + z = 195\n\n2. x_G + y_{DG} + y_{GS} + z = 367\n\n3. x_S + y_{DS} + y_{GS} + z = 562\n\nAdditionally, we know that:\n\nx_D + x_G + x_S = 437 (exactly two items)\n\nand\n\ny_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS} = 234 (exactly three items)\n\nWe need to find z.\n\nHmm, so we have five equations here with variables x_D, x_G, x_S, y_{DG}, y_{DS}, y_{GS}, z. That's seven variables and five equations. Hmm, so maybe we need to find another way to relate them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can add up the three equations for D, G, S.\n\nAdding equations 1, 2, 3:\n\n(x_D + x_G + x_S) + 2(y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS}) + 3z = 195 + 367 + 562\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side first:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, 195 + 367 is actually 562? Wait, 195 + 367: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Then 562 + 562 is 1124. So total RHS is 1124.\n\nLeft-hand side:\n\n(x_D + x_G + x_S) is 437,\n\nplus 2*(y terms) which is 2*234 = 468,\n\nplus 3z.\n\nTherefore:\n\n437 + 468 + 3z = 1124\n\nAdding 437 + 468: 400 + 400 = 800, 37 + 68 = 105, so total 905.\n\nSo 905 + 3z = 1124\n\nSubtract 905: 3z = 1124 - 905 = 219\n\nTherefore, z = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, so z is 73? That seems straightforward. Let me check my steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, adding equations 1, 2, 3:\n\nEach x term (x_D, x_G, x_S) appears once, each y term (each y_{DG}, y_{DS}, y_{GS}) appears twice (since each y is in two equations). For example, y_{DG} is in equation 1 and 2. Similarly for the others. And z is in all three equations, so 3z.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side is indeed (sum x) + 2*(sum y) + 3z.\n\nSum x is 437, sum y is 234, so 437 + 2*234 + 3z = 437 + 468 + 3z = 905 + 3z.\n\nSet equal to total of the three item counts: 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nSo 905 + 3z = 1124 => 3z = 219 => z = 73. That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73. Let me just verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if plugging back in works. Suppose z = 73.\n\nThen, from the first equation:\n\nx_D + y_{DG} + y_{DS} = 195 - z = 195 - 73 = 122\n\nSecond equation:\n\nx_G + y_{DG} + y_{GS} = 367 - 73 = 294\n\nThird equation:\n\nx_S + y_{DS} + y_{GS} = 562 - 73 = 489\n\nAlso, we know that x_D + x_G + x_S = 437,\n\nand y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS} = 234.\n\nLet me see if these can hold.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me call the first modified equation (after subtracting z):\n\nEquation 1a: x_D + (y_{DG} + y_{DS}) = 122\n\nBut y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS} = 234, so y_{DG} + y_{DS} = 234 - y_{GS}\n\nTherefore, equation 1a becomes x_D + (234 - y_{GS}) = 122 => x_D = 122 - 234 + y_{GS} = y_{GS} - 112\n\nSimilarly, equation 2a: x_G + (y_{DG} + y_{GS}) = 294\n\nBut y_{DG} + y_{GS} = (y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS}) - y_{DS} = 234 - y_{DS}\n\nThus equation 2a becomes x_G + (234 - y_{DS}) = 294 => x_G = 294 - 234 + y_{DS} = 60 + y_{DS}\n\nEquation 3a: x_S + (y_{DS} + y_{GS}) = 489\n\nSimilarly, y_{DS} + y_{GS} = (y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS}) - y_{DG} = 234 - y_{DG}\n\nThus equation 3a becomes x_S + (234 - y_{DG}) = 489 => x_S = 489 - 234 + y_{DG} = 255 + y_{DG}\n\nNow, let's substitute x_D, x_G, x_S in terms of y terms into the sum x_D + x_G + x_S = 437.\n\nSo:\n\nx_D + x_G + x_S = (y_{GS} - 112) + (60 + y_{DS}) + (255 + y_{DG}) ) = (y_{GS} + y_{DS} + y_{DG}) + (-112 + 60 + 255)\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe y terms sum to 234, so 234 + ( -112 + 60 + 255 )\n\nCalculating constants: -112 + 60 = -52; -52 + 255 = 203\n\nThus total is 234 + 203 = 437, which matches the required sum. So that checks out. Therefore, the value z=73 is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 73. Let me just make sure there isn't a trick or something I missed.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so C is universal. Therefore, all the intersections must include C. So when they mention \"exactly two of these things,\" that must include C and one other. Similarly for exactly three. So my initial reasoning holds. The inclusion-exclusion approach also seems valid because when we added the equations, we considered the overlaps properly.\n\nTherefore, I think 73 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem of finding the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items (diamond ring, set of golf clubs, garden spade, and bag of candy hearts), we start by noting the following key information:\n\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning each item:\n  - Diamond ring (D): 195\n  - Golf clubs (G): 367\n  - Garden spade (S): 562\n  - Candy hearts (C): 900 (everyone owns this)\n- Residents owning exactly two items: 437\n- Residents owning exactly three items: 234\n\nSince every resident owns a bag of candy hearts (C), the problem simplifies to finding the intersection of D, G, and S, as C is universal. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data to set up equations.\n\nWe denote:\n- \\( x_D, x_G, x_S \\) as the number of residents owning exactly two items (C plus one other).\n- \\( y_{DG}, y_{DS}, y_{GS} \\) as the number of residents owning exactly three items (C plus two others).\n- \\( z \\) as the number of residents owning all four items.\n\nThe equations based on the given data are:\n1. \\( x_D + x_G + x_S = 437 \\)\n2. \\( y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS} = 234 \\)\n\nFor each item's total ownership:\n- For D: \\( x_D + y_{DG} + y_{DS} + z = 195 \\)\n- For G: \\( x_G + y_{DG} + y_{GS} + z = 367 \\)\n- For S: \\( x_S + y_{DS} + y_{GS} + z = 562 \\)\n\nAdding these three equations:\n\\[\n(x_D + x_G + x_S) + 2(y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS}) + 3z = 195 + 367 + 562\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n437 + 2 \\times 234 + 3z = 1124\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n437 + 468 + 3z = 1124 \\implies 905 + 3z = 1124 \\implies 3z = 219 \\implies z = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\)."

We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data to set up equations.\n\nWe denote:\n- \\( x_D, x_G, x_S \\) as the number of residents owning exactly two items (C plus one other).\n- \\( y_{DG}, y_{DS}, y_{GS} \\) as the number of residents owning exactly three items (C plus two others).\n- \\( z \\) as the number of residents owning all four items.\n\nThe equations based on the given data are:\n1. \\( x_D + x_G + x_S = 437 \\)\n2. \\( y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS} = 234 \\)\n\nFor each item's total ownership:\n- For D: \\( x_D + y_{DG} + y_{DS} + z = 195 \\)\n- For G: \\( x_G + y_{DG} + y_{GS} + z = 367 \\)\n- For S: \\( x_S + y_{DS} + y_{GS} + z = 562 \\)\n\nAdding these three equations:\n\\[\n(x_D + x_G + x_S) + 2(y_{DG} + y_{DS} + y_{GS}) + 3z = 195 + 367 + 562\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n437 + 2 \\times 234 + 3z = 1124\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n437 + 468 + 3z = 1124 \\implies 905 + 3z = 1124 \\implies 3z = 219 \\implies z = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",
