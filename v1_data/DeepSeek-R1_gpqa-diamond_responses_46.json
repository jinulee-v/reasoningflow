        "response": "Okay, let's try to figure out this compound. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's start by looking at the IR data first. There are medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9. Those peaks are probably N-H stretches, maybe from an amine or an amide. Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is a carbonyl group. Carbonyls can be esters, amides, ketones, etc. But since there's an N in the formula, maybe it's an amide or an ester with an amine group somewhere.\n\nNow looking at the NMR. The first peak is at 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like in an ethyl ester or ether. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2. Then at 4.0 ppm, there's a broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlets in NMR often indicate NH2 groups, especially if they're not split much. But amines usually show up around 1-5 ppm, but the broadness suggests maybe an amide? Wait, but amide protons are usually around 6-8 ppm. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's an NH2 that's exchanging, so it's broad. But then the next peak is at 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a triplet, so maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3. So combining the triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5, that's likely an ethyl group attached to oxygen, like OCH2CH3. So maybe an ethoxy group or an ethyl ester.\n\nThen the aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring with two doublets. The downfield shift of the 8.0 ppm protons suggests they might be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like an ester or nitro group. Wait, but the compound has an NH2 group maybe? Let's see. If the benzene ring has an amino group (NH2), that's electron-donating, which would usually deshield the ortho and para protons. But wait, amino groups are ortho/para directors. Wait, but in the NMR, the protons at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm are each doublets, so para-substituted. Let me think. If there's a substituent in the para position, then the protons adjacent (ortho) would be one set, and the meta would be another? Wait, no. For a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, you might get two doublets. Wait, but if there's only one substituent, then the para positions are equivalent. Wait, maybe the substituent is in the para position, and the other substituent is part of a group. For example, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have a benzoate ester with an NH2 group in the para position. The ester group is OCH2CH3. Let's see.\n\nSo, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the ester group (COOEt) and an NH2 group para to it. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets because of the substituents. The NH2 is electron-donating, which would make the adjacent protons (ortho to NH2) more shielded, but the ester is electron-withdrawing, which would deshield the adjacent protons. Wait, maybe the protons ortho to the ester (which is COOEt) would be more deshielded, hence upfield or downfield? Let me recall. Electron-withdrawing groups like esters (COOR) deactivate the ring and cause the ortho and para protons to be deshielded, shifting them downfield. So if the ester is at the para position relative to the NH2, then the protons adjacent to the ester (ortho to COOEt) would be downfield, and the protons adjacent to NH2 (ortho to NH2) would be upfield. But in the NMR, the downfield protons are at 8.0 ppm (d) and the upfield at 7.0 ppm (d). So maybe the two substituents are para to each other: NH2 and COOEt. Then each substituent would have ortho protons. The COOEt group's ortho protons would be more downfield (8.0 ppm), and the NH2's ortho protons would be upfield (7.0 ppm). That makes sense. So the two doublets would each integrate to 2H, which matches the NMR data: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). \n\nNow, looking at the options: Option C is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That fits. Let's check the other options. \n\nOption A: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) on the phenyl ring and a formamide group (NHCHO). The IR would have a carbonyl from the amide, which is around 1680-1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 usually, but here the carbonyl is at 1720, which is higher, more like an ester. Also, formamide would have two N-H stretches (the IR shows two bands at 3420 and 3325), but the NMR would have a formyl proton as a singlet around 8 ppm maybe? But the NMR here doesn't show that. Instead, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm, which would be OCH2CH3. But in option A, the ethoxy is on the phenyl, so the ethyl group would be as OCH2CH3, giving triplet and quartet. Wait, but in the NMR here, the triplet is at 1.2 (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2), which matches an ethyl ester or ethoxy. But if the compound is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, then the ethoxy is on the benzene, and the formamide is NHCHO. The formamide would have protons: the NH would be split maybe, but the formyl (CHO) proton is usually around 8-9 ppm as a singlet. The NMR here has 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as aromatic protons. So maybe not. Also, the carbonyl in formamide is lower than ester, so IR at 1720 is more ester. So probably not A.\n\nOption B: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, propionate ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3? Then the NMR would have a triplet for the CH3, but here the triplet is at 1.2 ppm, which is more like ethyl (CH2CH3). Propionate would have a CH2CH2CH3 group, so maybe a triplet around 1.0 ppm (for the terminal CH3) and a sextet or something for the middle CH2. But the NMR here shows triplet at 1.2 and quartet at 4.5, which fits ethyl, not propyl. So B is less likely.\n\nOption D: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is CONH2. The carbonyl here would be an amide, which is around 1680-1650 cm\u207b\u00b9, but the IR here has 1720, which is more ester. Also, benzamide would have NH2 protons, which might be around 6-7 ppm as broad peaks. But the NMR here has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which is maybe too upfield for NH2. Also, 3-ethoxy would have a different substitution pattern on the benzene. The aromatic protons would not be two doublets but maybe more complex splitting. So D is less likely.\n\nSo putting it all together: the IR has a carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, likely an ester. The ethyl group (triplet and quartet) suggests an ethyl ester. The NH2 group (broad singlet at 4.0 ppm) might be part of an aromatic amine, like 4-aminobenzoate ester. The aromatic protons as two doublets suggest para substitution. So option C: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2 (benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl adds C2H5, amine replaces one O with NH2? Wait, wait. Let me check the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. If one of the hydrogens is replaced by NH2, then the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Yes, because benzoate is C7H5O2-, ethyl is C2H5, so ethyl benzoate is C9H10O2. Replacing a hydrogen (from the benzene) with NH2 would give C9H9NO2, but wait, maybe the amine is already accounted for. Wait, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be NH2-C6H4-COOEt. The formula would be C6H4 (minus two H for the substituents) + NH2 + COOEt. Let's calculate: COOEt is O2C-C2H5, so COOEt is (COOCH2CH3) which is C3H5O2. The benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt substituents: C6H5NH2COOCH2CH3? Wait, maybe better to count:\n\nBenzoate is C7H5O2 (since benzoic acid is C7H6O2, losing a proton gives C7H5O2-). Ethyl ester would add C2H5, so ethyl benzoate is C7H5O2 + C2H5 = C9H10O2. If we have an amino group on the benzene ring (replacing a hydrogen), then the formula becomes C9H11NO2. Because NH2 adds one N and two H compared to replacing a H. So yes, that matches the molecular formula given. So option C is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The NMR signals: ethyl group (triplet and quartet), NH2 as a broad singlet (though usually NH2 in aromatic amines can be broad around 4 ppm?), and the aromatic protons as two doublets para-substituted. The IR carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 confirms the ester. So the answer should be C."
