        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given parameters are the interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 equal to 30 degrees. Hmm, interplanar distance... I remember that's calculated using the Miller indices and some formula related to the crystal lattice parameters. But wait, rhombohedral crystal systems can be a bit tricky. Let me recall.\n\nFirst, the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system. I think in general, for any crystal system, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the inverse of the square root of some quadratic form involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. But the exact formula depends on the crystal system. Since this is rhombohedral, which is a subset of the trigonal system, right? The rhombohedral lattice has all sides equal (a = b = c) and all angles equal (\u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3). So here, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms? Wait, but the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Is that the edge length of the rhombohedron? Probably, yes. Because in a rhombohedral lattice, the primitive vectors all have the same length, and the angles between them are all equal. So here, a = 10 Angstroms, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3 = 30 degrees.\n\nSo, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice. Let me check. The general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:\n\n1/(d^2) = ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) sin^2 \u03b1 + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos^2 \u03b1 - cos \u03b1) ) / (a^2 (1 - 3 cos^2 \u03b1 + 2 cos^3 \u03b1)) )\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should convert the rhombohedral lattice to its equivalent hexagonal lattice parameters? Because sometimes it's easier to work with hexagonal axes when dealing with rhombohedral crystals. The conversion between rhombohedral and hexagonal settings might help here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the interplanar distance in terms of the reciprocal lattice vectors. Since the interplanar distance is related to the reciprocal lattice. Let me recall that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is 1 / |G|, where G is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the plane (hkl). So, if I can compute the reciprocal lattice parameters, then I can find the magnitude of G for (111) and invert it to get d.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a rhombohedral (trigonal) system, the reciprocal lattice parameters can be calculated from the direct lattice parameters. The direct lattice has a = b = c, \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3. The reciprocal lattice will also have a* = b* = c*, and the angles \u03b1* = \u03b2* = \u03b3*. The relationship between direct and reciprocal lattice parameters is more complex than in cubic systems.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula specific for rhombohedral systems. Let me look it up in my mind. The formula for d-spacing in rhombohedral crystals is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = [ (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 + l\u00b2) sin\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2(hk + kl + lh)(cos\u00b2 \u03b1 - cos \u03b1) ] / [ a\u00b2 (1 - 3 cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2 cos\u00b3 \u03b1) ]\n\nSo plugging in h = 1, k = 1, l = 1, \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, a = 10 Angstroms.\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the numerator:\n\nN = (1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) sin\u00b2 30\u00b0 + 2(1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1)(cos\u00b2 30\u00b0 - cos 30\u00b0)\n\nCompute each part:\n\nSum of squares: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nsin\u00b2 30\u00b0 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nSo first term: 3 * 0.25 = 0.75\n\nNext, the second part: 2*(1 + 1 + 1)*(cos\u00b2 30\u00b0 - cos 30\u00b0)\n\nSum of hk etc: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nMultiply by 2: 2*3 = 6\n\nCompute cos\u00b2 30\u00b0 - cos 30\u00b0:\n\ncos 30\u00b0 = \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.8660\n\ncos\u00b2 30\u00b0 = (\u221a3/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nSo cos\u00b2 30\u00b0 - cos 30\u00b0 = 0.75 - 0.8660 \u2248 -0.1160\n\nMultiply by 6: 6*(-0.1160) \u2248 -0.696\n\nSo numerator N \u2248 0.75 - 0.696 \u2248 0.054\n\nNow denominator:\n\nD = a\u00b2 (1 - 3 cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2 cos\u00b3 \u03b1)\n\nCompute inside the parentheses:\n\n1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.8660)^3\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: -3*0.75 = -2.25\n\nThird term: 2*(0.8660)^3 \u2248 2*(0.6495) \u2248 1.299\n\nSo total: 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 \u2248 (1 - 2.25) + 1.299 = (-1.25) + 1.299 \u2248 0.049\n\nTherefore, denominator D = (10)^2 * 0.049 = 100 * 0.049 = 4.9\n\nSo 1/d\u00b2 = N / D \u2248 0.054 / 4.9 \u2248 0.01102\n\nThen d \u2248 1 / sqrt(0.01102) \u2248 1 / 0.105 \u2248 9.52 Angstroms\n\nLooking at the options, A is 9.54, D is 9.08. Hmm, 9.52 is close to 9.54. Maybe my approximations during calculation introduced some error. Let me check the exact calculation.\n\nFirst, let's compute cos(30\u00b0). Exact value is \u221a3/2 \u2248 0.8660254\n\nCompute cos\u00b2(30\u00b0) = 3/4 = 0.75\n\ncos\u00b3(30\u00b0) = (\u221a3/2)^3 = (3\u221a3)/8 \u2248 (3*1.732)/8 \u2248 5.196/8 \u2248 0.6495\n\nSo denominator inside the parentheses:\n\n1 - 3*(0.75) + 2*(0.6495) = 1 - 2.25 + 1.299 = (1 - 2.25) + 1.299 = (-1.25) + 1.299 = 0.049 exactly.\n\nSo denominator D = 10^2 * 0.049 = 4.9\n\nNumerator:\n\nFirst term: 3 * sin\u00b2(30\u00b0) = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75\n\nSecond term: 2*(3)*(cos\u00b2(30\u00b0) - cos(30\u00b0)) = 6*(0.75 - 0.8660254) = 6*(-0.1160254) \u2248 -0.6961524\n\nSo total numerator N = 0.75 - 0.6961524 \u2248 0.0538476\n\nThus, 1/d\u00b2 = 0.0538476 / 4.9 \u2248 0.0109893\n\nTherefore, d = 1 / sqrt(0.0109893) \u2248 1 / 0.10483 \u2248 9.54 Angstroms\n\nAh, so with more precise calculation, it's exactly 9.54, which is option A. So the answer should be A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I used the correct formula. Because sometimes different sources might have different conventions for rhombohedral crystals. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way if we consider the rhombohedral system as a special case of the hexagonal system.\n\nWait, another approach: The rhombohedral unit cell can be transformed into a hexagonal unit cell. The conversion between rhombohedral and hexagonal axes might make the calculation easier. Let me try that.\n\nIn the rhombohedral system, the hexagonal unit cell has parameters a_h and c_h, related to the rhombohedral parameters a_r and \u03b1. The conversion formulas are:\n\na_h = 2a_r sin(\u03b1/2)\n\nc_h = a_r sqrt(3 + 6 cos \u03b1)\n\nBut maybe I need to check the exact relations. Alternatively, the volume of the rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 sqrt(1 - 3 cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2 cos\u00b3 \u03b1). Which was in the denominator of the d-spacing formula earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I convert to hexagonal coordinates, then the interplanar distance formula for hexagonal systems is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = 4/(3a\u00b2) (h\u00b2 + hk + k\u00b2) + (l\u00b2)/(c\u00b2)\n\nBut wait, if we convert the rhombohedral to hexagonal, then we need to express the (111) plane in hexagonal indices. Wait, maybe this complicates things more. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the general formula for triclinic systems, since rhombohedral is a special case of triclinic with a = b = c and \u03b1 = \u03b2 = \u03b3. The triclinic formula for d-spacing is:\n\n1/d\u00b2 = (1 / V\u00b2) [ S11 h\u00b2 + S22 k\u00b2 + S33 l\u00b2 + 2S12 hk + 2S23 kl + 2S13 hl ]\n\nWhere V is the volume of the unit cell, and Sij are the elements of the metric tensor. But since this is rhombohedral, the metric tensor will be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the volume of the unit cell first. For a rhombohedral system, the volume V is a\u00b3 sqrt(1 - 3 cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2 cos\u00b3 \u03b1). Let's compute that.\n\nGiven \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, a = 10 Angstroms.\n\nCompute the term inside the square root:\n\n1 - 3 cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2 cos\u00b3 \u03b1\n\nWe already computed this earlier as 0.049, so sqrt(0.049) \u2248 0.2217\n\nTherefore, V = (10)^3 * 0.2217 \u2248 1000 * 0.2217 \u2248 221.7 Angstrom\u00b3\n\nBut how does this help me? Maybe not directly. Let's get back to the original formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for d-spacing in terms of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. For a rhombohedral lattice, since all axes are equal and angles are equal, maybe the formula simplifies.\n\nWait, another thought: In cubic systems, the interplanar distance for (111) is a / sqrt(1 + 1 + 1) = a / sqrt(3). But that's only true for cubic systems. Here, the angles are 30\u00b0, not 90\u00b0, so it's different. But maybe there's a similar approach.\n\nWait, if I consider the (111) plane, the normal vector to the plane is in the [111] direction. The interplanar distance would be the distance between adjacent planes along this direction. But in a rhombohedral lattice, the distance along [111] might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parameterize the planes. The (111) planes are separated by a distance d. The equation of the planes is hx + ky + lz = n, where n is an integer. For (111), the equation is x + y + z = n. The distance between the planes n and n+1 would be d.\n\nIn a general triclinic lattice, the distance between two adjacent planes is given by the inverse of the norm of the reciprocal lattice vector. But again, this circles back to the reciprocal lattice approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that in any crystal system, the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:\n\nd = 1 / |G|\n\nWhere G is the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the plane (hkl). The reciprocal lattice vector G is given by:\n\nG = h a* + k b* + l c*\n\nWhere a*, b*, c* are the reciprocal lattice vectors. The magnitude |G| is sqrt(G \u22c5 G), which involves the dot products of the reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nBut since in the rhombohedral system, the direct lattice vectors have the same length and same angles between them, the reciprocal lattice vectors will also have the same length and same angles between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the reciprocal lattice parameters. For a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with parameters:\n\na* = (2\u03c0 / V) * (b \u00d7 c)\n\nSimilarly for b* and c*. But since all vectors are symmetric, a* = b* = c*.\n\nAlternatively, the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vectors can be computed as:\n\n|a*| = |b*| = |c*| = (2\u03c0 / a\u00b2 sin \u03b1) ) * sqrt(1 - 3 cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2 cos\u00b3 \u03b1)\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me recall the general formula for reciprocal lattice vectors in terms of direct lattice parameters.\n\nIn general, for a triclinic lattice, the reciprocal lattice vectors are:\n\na* = (2\u03c0) (b \u00d7 c) / V\n\nb* = (2\u03c0) (c \u00d7 a) / V\n\nc* = (2\u03c0) (a \u00d7 b) / V\n\nWhere V is the volume of the unit cell.\n\nGiven that in the rhombohedral lattice, a = b = c, and angles between any two vectors are \u03b1. Let's denote the direct lattice vectors as a, b, c, each with magnitude |a| = |b| = |c| = 10 Angstroms, and the angle between any two is 30\u00b0.\n\nFirst, compute the volume V = a \u22c5 (b \u00d7 c)\n\nThe scalar triple product. Since all vectors have the same magnitude and angles, the volume is:\n\nV = a\u00b3 sqrt(1 - 3 cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2 cos\u00b3 \u03b1)\n\nAs computed earlier, with \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, V \u2248 221.7 Angstrom\u00b3\n\nNow, compute the reciprocal lattice vectors. Let's compute a*:\n\na* = (2\u03c0) (b \u00d7 c) / V\n\nBut since we are dealing with magnitudes and not vectors, perhaps we can compute |a*|.\n\nThe magnitude |b \u00d7 c| is |b||c| sin \u03b1 = 10 * 10 * sin 30\u00b0 = 100 * 0.5 = 50\n\nTherefore, |a*| = (2\u03c0) |b \u00d7 c| / V = (2\u03c0) * 50 / 221.7 \u2248 (100\u03c0) / 221.7 \u2248 314.16 / 221.7 \u2248 1.417 Angstrom\u207b\u00b9\n\nSimilarly, |a*| = |b*| = |c*| \u2248 1.417 Angstrom\u207b\u00b9\n\nNow, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors, say between a* and b*, is given by:\n\ncos \u03b1* = (cos \u03b2 cos \u03b3 - cos \u03b1) / (sin \u03b2 sin \u03b3)\n\nBut in the rhombohedral case, all angles \u03b1* = \u03b2* = \u03b3*, and they can be computed as:\n\ncos \u03b1* = (cos^2 \u03b1 - cos \u03b1) / (1 - cos \u03b1)\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall the relationship between direct and reciprocal lattice angles.\n\nIn general, for triclinic systems, the angles in reciprocal space are related to the direct space angles, but it's complicated. However, in the rhombohedral case, due to symmetry, the reciprocal lattice angles can be computed.\n\nAlternatively, since the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral, the angle \u03b1* between reciprocal vectors can be found using:\n\ncos \u03b1* = -cos \u03b1 / (1 + cos \u03b1)\n\nWait, I need to verify this. Let me think.\n\nIn a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors satisfy:\n\na* \u22c5 b* = |a*||b*| cos \u03b1*\n\nBut a* \u22c5 b* = (2\u03c0)^2 ( (b \u00d7 c) \u22c5 (c \u00d7 a) ) / V^2\n\nWait, this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a simpler relation.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice is also rhombohedral with parameters:\n\na* = b* = c* = 2\u03c0 / (a sin \u03b1 sqrt(1 - 3 cos\u00b2 \u03b1 + 2 cos\u00b3 \u03b1))\n\nAnd the angles \u03b1* satisfy:\n\ncos \u03b1* = (cos \u03b1) / (1 - cos \u03b1)\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Let me check with \u03b1 = 30\u00b0, compute \u03b1*.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the metric tensor. The metric tensor for the direct lattice is:\n\nG = [ a\u00b2   a\u00b2 cos \u03b1   a\u00b2 cos \u03b1\n\n      a\u00b2 cos \u03b1   a\u00b2   a\u00b2 cos \u03b1\n\n      a\u00b2 cos \u03b1   a\u00b2 cos \u03b1   a\u00b2 ]\n\nSimilarly, the reciprocal metric tensor G* is the inverse of G. The elements of G* will give us the dot products of the reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nBut inverting this 3x3 matrix might be tedious, but since the matrix is symmetric and all diagonal elements are equal, and all off-diagonal elements are equal, we can use the formula for the inverse of a symmetric matrix with equal entries.\n\nLet me denote the direct metric tensor as:\n\n[ A  B  B\n\n  B  A  B\n\n  B  B  A ]\n\nWhere A = a\u00b2 = 100 Angstrom\u00b2\n\nB = a\u00b2 cos \u03b1 = 100 * cos 30\u00b0 \u2248 100 * 0.8660 \u2248 86.60 Angstrom\u00b2\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is |G| = A\u00b3 + 2B\u00b3 - 3A B\u00b2\n\nPlugging in:\n\n|G| = (100)^3 + 2*(86.60)^3 - 3*100*(86.60)^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n100\u00b3 = 1,000,000\n\n86.60\u00b3 \u2248 86.60 * 86.60 * 86.60 \u2248 first compute 86.60\u00b2 \u2248 7500 (approx?), wait 86.60*86.60:\n\n86 * 86 = 7396, 0.6*86 = 51.6, 0.6*0.6=0.36, so total (86 + 0.6)^2 = 86\u00b2 + 2*86*0.6 + 0.6\u00b2 = 7396 + 103.2 + 0.36 = 7499.56 \u2248 7499.56\n\nThen 86.60\u00b3 \u2248 86.60 * 7499.56 \u2248 let's approximate 86.6 * 7500 = 649,500\n\nBut more accurately, 86.6 * 7499.56 \u2248 86.6*(7500 - 0.44) \u2248 86.6*7500 - 86.6*0.44 \u2248 649,500 - 38.104 \u2248 649,461.9\n\nSo 2*86.60\u00b3 \u2248 2*649,461.9 \u2248 1,298,923.8\n\nNext term: 3*A*B\u00b2 = 3*100*(86.60)^2 \u2248 3*100*7499.56 \u2248 3*100*7500 \u2248 225,000 (approximate, but exact value is 3*100*7499.56 = 2,249,868)\n\nWait, wait, hold on:\n\nWait, B\u00b2 = (86.60)^2 \u2248 7499.56\n\nSo 3*A*B\u00b2 = 3*100*7499.56 \u2248 3*749,956 \u2248 2,249,868\n\nTherefore, determinant |G| = 1,000,000 + 1,298,923.8 - 2,249,868 \u2248 (1,000,000 + 1,298,923.8) - 2,249,868 \u2248 2,298,923.8 - 2,249,868 \u2248 49,055.8 Angstrom\u2076\n\nSo the determinant is approximately 49,055.8 Angstrom\u2076\n\nThe inverse of the metric tensor G* will have elements:\n\nFor diagonal elements: (A\u00b2 - B\u00b2)/|G|\n\nFor off-diagonal elements: (B\u00b2 - A B)/|G|\n\nWait, the inverse of a 3x3 symmetric matrix with diagonal elements A and off-diagonal B is given by:\n\nThe diagonal entries of G* are (A\u00b2 - B\u00b2 + B\u00b2 - A B)/|G|? Wait, perhaps I need to use the formula for the inverse.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the inverse of a 3x3 matrix:\n\nThe inverse matrix G\u207b\u00b9 = (1/|G|) * adjugate matrix\n\nFor a matrix:\n\n[ A B B\n\n  B A B\n\n  B B A ]\n\nThe adjugate matrix will have:\n\nDiagonal elements: A\u00b2 - B\u00b2\n\nOff-diagonal elements: B\u00b2 - A B\n\nWait, let me verify.\n\nThe cofactor for the (1,1) element is:\n\n| A  B |\n\n| B  A | = A\u00b2 - B\u00b2\n\nSimilarly for other diagonal elements.\n\nThe cofactor for the (1,2) element is:\n\n- | B  B |\n\n  | B  A | = - (B A - B\u00b2) = -B(A - B)\n\nBut since all off-diagonal elements are B, the off-diagonal cofactors will be -B(A - B) = B\u00b2 - A B\n\nTherefore, the adjugate matrix is:\n\n[ A\u00b2 - B\u00b2   B\u00b2 - A B   B\u00b2 - A B\n\n  B\u00b2 - A B   A\u00b2 - B\u00b2   B\u00b2 - A B\n\n  B\u00b2 - A B   B\u00b2 - A B   A\u00b2 - B\u00b2 ]\n\nTherefore, the inverse metric tensor G* is (1 / |G|) times the adjugate matrix.\n\nTherefore, the diagonal elements of G* are (A\u00b2 - B\u00b2)/|G|, and the off-diagonal elements are (B\u00b2 - A B)/|G|\n\nSo, the reciprocal metric tensor components:\n\nG*_11 = (A\u00b2 - B\u00b2)/|G| \u2248 (100\u00b2 - 86.60\u00b2)/49,055.8 \u2248 (10,000 - 7,499.56)/49,055.8 \u2248 2,500.44 / 49,055.8 \u2248 0.05096\n\nSimilarly, G*_12 = (B\u00b2 - A B)/|G| \u2248 (7,499.56 - 100*86.60)/49,055.8 \u2248 (7,499.56 - 8,660)/49,055.8 \u2248 (-1,160.44)/49,055.8 \u2248 -0.02365\n\nTherefore, the reciprocal metric tensor has diagonal elements \u2248 0.05096 Angstrom\u207b\u00b2 and off-diagonal elements \u2248 -0.02365 Angstrom\u207b\u00b2\n\nNow, the reciprocal lattice vectors squared magnitudes are given by G*_11, so |a*|\u00b2 = G*_11 \u2248 0.05096 Angstrom\u207b\u00b2, so |a*| \u2248 sqrt(0.05096) \u2248 0.2257 Angstrom\u207b\u00b9\n\nSimilarly, the angle between reciprocal lattice vectors is given by:\n\ncos \u03b1* = G*_12 / |a*|\u00b2 \u2248 (-0.02365) / 0.05096 \u2248 -0.464\n\nTherefore, \u03b1* \u2248 arccos(-0.464) \u2248 117.6 degrees\n\nBut how does this help me compute |G| for the (111) plane?\n\nThe reciprocal lattice vector G for the (111) plane is G = 1*a* + 1*b* + 1*c*\n\nThe magnitude squared |G|\u00b2 is:\n\nG*_11 + G*_22 + G*_33 + 2(G*_12 + G*_23 + G*_13)\n\nSince all diagonal elements are equal and all off-diagonal elements are equal:\n\n|G|\u00b2 = 3*G*_11 + 6*G*_12 \u2248 3*0.05096 + 6*(-0.02365) \u2248 0.15288 - 0.1419 \u2248 0.01098 Angstrom\u207b\u00b2\n\nTherefore, |G| \u2248 sqrt(0.01098) \u2248 0.1048 Angstrom\u207b\u00b9\n\nThus, the interplanar distance d = 1 / |G| \u2248 1 / 0.1048 \u2248 9.54 Angstroms\n\nSo that confirms the previous result. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 9.54 Angstrom.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
