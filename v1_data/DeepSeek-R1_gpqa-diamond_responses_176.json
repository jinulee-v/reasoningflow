        "response": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the luminosity ratio between two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has both radius and mass 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Their peak wavelengths are the same, and their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The answer choices are all around 2.2 to 2.35, so I need to figure out which factor is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that luminosity for a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074, where R is radius, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. But here, the problem mentions mass and radial velocity. Hmm, how does mass come into play here? Maybe through the Doppler shift affecting the observed peak wavelength?\n\nWait, the peak wavelength is the same as observed, but their radial velocities are different. Since one star is moving at 700 km/s away from us, there might be a Doppler shift involved. The peak wavelength they observed might be shifted due to the star's velocity. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So does that mean that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted peak wavelengths are different due to Doppler shift?\n\nYes, that must be it. Because if a star is moving away from us, its light is redshifted, meaning the emitted wavelength is shorter than what we observe. Conversely, if it's moving towards us, it's blueshifted. But Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which I assume is moving away (since positive radial velocity usually means recession), so its emitted peak wavelength is shorter than observed. But since the observed peak wavelengths are the same, the actual emitted peak wavelengths must be different.\n\nSo, using the Doppler shift formula: \u03bb_observed / \u03bb_emitted = 1 + v/c, where v is the radial velocity (if moving away). For Star_1, v = 0, so \u03bb_observed1 = \u03bb_emitted1. For Star_2, \u03bb_observed2 = \u03bb_emitted2 * (1 + v/c). But the problem states that \u03bb_observed1 = \u03bb_observed2. Therefore, \u03bb_emitted1 = \u03bb_emitted2 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, \u03bb_emitted2 = \u03bb_emitted1 / (1 + v/c).\n\nBut the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: \u03bb_peak = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So, \u03bb_emitted is proportional to 1/T. Therefore, if \u03bb_emitted2 = \u03bb_emitted1 / (1 + v/c), then 1/T2 = (1/T1) / (1 + v/c), so T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).\n\nTherefore, the temperature of Star_2 is higher than Star_1 by a factor of (1 + v/c). Wait, but Star_2 is moving away, so its emitted wavelength is actually shorter (since observed is longer), so its temperature is higher? Because shorter peak wavelength corresponds to higher temperature. Yes, that makes sense. So T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c).\n\nBut wait, let me check the Doppler shift formula again. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), so the emitted wavelength is shorter. So \u03bb_emitted = \u03bb_observed / (1 + v/c). Therefore, using Wien's Law, \u03bb_peak ~ 1/T, so T ~ 1/\u03bb_peak. Therefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So yes, Star_2 is hotter by a factor of (1 + v/c). Wait, but Star_2 is moving away, so its actual temperature is higher? That seems counter-intuitive. If a star is moving away, its temperature isn't actually higher; it's just that the light is redshifted. But in this problem, we are told that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So to have the same observed peak wavelength, Star_2 must have a higher temperature because its emitted peak wavelength is shorter, which when redshifted by (1 + v/c) becomes equal to Star_1's observed peak wavelength.\n\nSo, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, T2 is higher than T1 by that factor.\n\nNow, let's compute (1 + v/c). The radial velocity v is 700 km/s for Star_2. The speed of light c is approximately 3 x 10^5 km/s. So v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300,000 = 7 / 3000 \u2248 0.002333...\n\nTherefore, 1 + v/c \u2248 1.002333...\n\nSo T2 \u2248 T1 * 1.002333...\n\nSo the temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than Star_1.\n\nBut Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and mass 1.5 times larger. Wait, but how does mass factor into this? The problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant? Unless mass affects the temperature? Hmm, but in reality, mass does affect the luminosity and temperature of a star, but if we are to treat them as black bodies with given radii and temperatures, maybe mass is just extra information? Wait, but the problem says \"assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies,\" so perhaps we can ignore any mass-luminosity relation here and just use the black body formula?\n\nWait, but the problem gives both radius and mass as 1.5 times larger. Maybe mass is a distractor? Or maybe not. Wait, in the Stefan-Boltzmann law, luminosity depends on radius and temperature. Mass isn't directly involved unless we need to relate mass to temperature or radius through some other relation. But the problem states to assume black body radiation, so perhaps mass is irrelevant here? But the problem mentions mass, so maybe I need to consider the mass-luminosity relation? Wait, but the problem says \"assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies,\" which would imply that we should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's law, and not necessarily the mass-luminosity relation. So maybe mass is a red herring?\n\nWait, but let me check. The mass-luminosity relation says L \u221d M^3 or something like that, but that's for main-sequence stars. However, the problem says to treat them as black bodies, so perhaps we shouldn't use that. So maybe mass is given but not needed? The problem says \"the mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times)\". So same factor as radius. So radius is 1.5, mass is 1.5. But unless there's a relation between mass, radius, and temperature, which isn't given here, perhaps we can ignore mass?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to use the Doppler shift to find the temperature ratio, then compute luminosity ratio using Stefan-Boltzmann.\n\nSo let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find the ratio of temperatures T1 and T2.\n\nFrom the observed peak wavelengths being the same, considering Doppler shift.\n\nFor Star_1: radial velocity 0, so observed wavelength \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb1_emit.\n\nFor Star_2: radial velocity 700 km/s away, so observed wavelength \u03bb2_obs = \u03bb2_emit * (1 + v/c). But since \u03bb1_obs = \u03bb2_obs, then \u03bb1_emit = \u03bb2_emit * (1 + v/c).\n\nBut Wien's Law: \u03bb_emit = b / T.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb1_emit = b / T1, \u03bb2_emit = b / T2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nb / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nCancel b:\n\n1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * (1 + v/c)\n\nTherefore, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c)\n\nSo T2 / T1 = 1 + v/c \u2248 1 + 700 / 3e5 \u2248 1 + 0.002333 \u2248 1.002333\n\nSo T2 \u2248 1.002333 T1\n\nTherefore, the temperature of Star_2 is slightly higher than Star_1.\n\nNow, compute luminosity ratio.\n\nLuminosity L = 4\u03c0R\u00b2\u03c3T\u2074\n\nTherefore, L1 / L2 = (R1\u00b2 T1\u2074) / (R2\u00b2 T2\u2074)\n\nGiven R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5\n\nT2 = 1.002333 T1, so T1/T2 = 1 / 1.002333 \u2248 0.99767\n\nTherefore,\n\nL1 / L2 = (1.5\u00b2) * (T1 / T2)^4 \u2248 (2.25) * (0.99767)^4\n\nCompute (0.99767)^4:\n\nFirst compute ln(0.99767) \u2248 -0.002345\n\nMultiply by 4: -0.00938\n\nExponentiate: e^(-0.00938) \u2248 1 - 0.00938 \u2248 0.9906\n\nWait, but more accurately:\n\n0.99767^4\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n0.99767^2 = (0.99767)*(0.99767)\n\nMultiply 0.99767 * 0.99767:\n\nFirst, 1*1 = 1, subtract 0.00233*1 + 0.00233*1 - (0.00233)^2 \u2248 0.00466 - 0.0000054 \u2248 0.00465\n\nSo approximately 1 - 0.00465 = 0.99535\n\nThen square that: (0.99535)^2 \u2248\n\nSimilarly, 0.99535*0.99535 \u2248 1 - 2*0.00465 + (0.00465)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.0093 + 0.0000216 \u2248 0.99072\n\nAlternatively, use calculator:\n\n0.99767^4 = ?\n\nLet me compute 0.99767^2 first:\n\n0.99767 * 0.99767\n\nCalculate:\n\n(1 - 0.00233)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 \u2248 0.995345\n\nThen, 0.995345^2 \u2248 (1 - 0.004655)^2 \u2248 1 - 2*0.004655 + (0.004655)^2 \u2248 1 - 0.00931 + 0.0000217 \u2248 0.99071\n\nSo approximately 0.9907\n\nTherefore, L1 / L2 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.25 - 2.25*0.0093 \u2248 2.25 - 0.0209 \u2248 2.2291\n\nSo approximately 2.23, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The problem says \"the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of...\" So L1 / L2 \u2248 2.23, so the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I did the temperature ratio correctly.\n\nWe had T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). Therefore, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c). Therefore, T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v/c) \u2248 1 / 1.002333 \u2248 0.99767.\n\nSo when computing L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 (1.5)^2 * (0.99767)^4 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.23.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, another way: Let's compute (1 + v/c) with exact value.\n\nv = 700 km/s\n\nc = 3e5 km/s\n\nv/c = 700 / 300000 = 7 / 3000 \u2248 0.002333333...\n\nSo 1 + v/c = 1.002333333...\n\nThen, T2 = T1 * 1.0023333...\n\nTherefore, T1 = T2 / 1.0023333...\n\nSo T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0023333... \u2248 0.997668\n\nThen, (T1 / T2)^4 \u2248 (0.997668)^4\n\nLet me compute this more accurately.\n\nFirst, compute ln(0.997668) \u2248 -0.002345\n\nMultiply by 4: -0.00938\n\nExponentiate: e^(-0.00938) \u2248 1 - 0.00938 + (0.00938)^2/2 - (0.00938)^3/6\n\nCompute:\n\n1 - 0.00938 = 0.99062\n\n(0.00938)^2 = 0.000088, divided by 2: 0.000044\n\n(0.00938)^3 \u2248 0.00000083, divided by 6 \u2248 0.00000014\n\nSo total \u2248 0.99062 + 0.000044 - 0.00000014 \u2248 0.99066\n\nSo e^(-0.00938) \u2248 0.99066\n\nTherefore, (T1 / T2)^4 \u2248 0.99066\n\nThen, L1 / L2 = 1.5^2 * 0.99066 \u2248 2.25 * 0.99066 \u2248 2.25 * 0.99 + 2.25 * 0.00066 \u2248 2.2275 + 0.0015 \u2248 2.229\n\nSo approximately 2.23, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, the answer choices are A: ~2.23, B: ~2.32, C: ~2.25, D: ~2.35.\n\nSo 2.23 is option A.\n\nBut let me check again if I messed up the ratio.\n\nWait, L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4\n\nBut R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25\n\nT1 / T2 is 1 / (1 + v/c) \u2248 0.997668, so (T1/T2)^4 \u2248 0.99066\n\nMultiply 2.25 * 0.99066 \u2248 2.25 - 2.25*0.00934 \u2248 2.25 - 0.021 \u2248 2.229\n\nYes, so approximately 2.23, answer A.\n\nBut wait, another thought: Is the Doppler shift formula correct here? Because radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. The standard Doppler shift formula for non-relativistic speeds (v << c) is \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_emit = 1 + v/c. But if the velocity is significant, should we use the relativistic formula?\n\nWait, 700 km/s is 0.233% of the speed of light (since c = 3e5 km/s, 700 / 3e5 = 0.00233). So v/c is about 0.00233, which is small enough that the non-relativistic approximation is fine. So \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_emit * (1 + v/c). So our previous calculation holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A: ~2.23.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again:\n\n\"Astronomers are interested in the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than that of Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also larger by the same factor (1.5 times). Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. Astronomers also calculated the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:\"\n\nSo, key points:\n\n- Same observed peak wavelength.\n\n- Radial velocities: Star_1 at 0, Star_2 at 700 km/s.\n\nSo, Star_2's peak wavelength is Doppler shifted. Therefore, actual emitted peak wavelength is shorter.\n\nTherefore, using Wien's Law, T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). Then, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/(1 + v/c))^4 \u2248 2.25 * (1/1.002333)^4 \u2248 2.25 * 0.99066 \u2248 2.229, so ~2.23, answer A.\n\nBut wait, the answer options include C: ~2.25. Maybe someone might forget to account for the Doppler shift and just compute (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option C. But the problem says the observed peak wavelengths are the same, which requires considering Doppler shift. So the correct answer should be A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the temperature ratio. Wait, if Star_2 is moving away, then the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. But since observed wavelengths are the same, Star_2 must have a shorter emitted wavelength, hence higher temperature.\n\nYes, so T2 = T1 * (1 + v/c). So T2 is higher. Then, when computing L1/L2, since L \u221d R\u00b2 T\u2074, and Star_1 has larger radius but lower temperature.\n\nSo L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = 2.25 * (1/(1 + v/c))^4 \u2248 2.25 * 0.9906 \u2248 2.23.\n\nTherefore, answer A.\n\nBut let me check once more with exact numbers.\n\nCompute v/c = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333...\n\n1 + v/c = 1.002333...\n\n(1/(1.002333...))^4 = 1 / (1.002333...)^4\n\nCompute (1.002333...)^4:\n\nFirst, take natural logarithm: ln(1.002333) \u2248 0.002330\n\nMultiply by 4: 0.00932\n\nExponentiate: e^0.00932 \u2248 1.00937\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, (1 + x)^4 \u2248 e^{4x} for small x.\n\nBut x = 0.002333, so 4x = 0.009333\n\ne^{0.009333} \u2248 1.00937\n\nTherefore, (1.002333)^4 \u2248 1.00937, so 1/(1.002333)^4 \u2248 1 / 1.00937 \u2248 0.9907\n\nTherefore, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 \u2248 2.229, which is ~2.23.\n\nSo answer A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
