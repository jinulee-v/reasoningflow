        "question": "There exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where there are two real numbers, x and y, both greater than 1. The conditions given are that the logarithm of y^x with base x is equal to 10, and also the logarithm of x^{4y} with base y is equal to 10. Then I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall some logarithm properties. The logarithm log_b(a) is the exponent you need to raise base b to get a. So, log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. Also, there's a change of base formula: log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b), where ln is the natural logarithm. Maybe that will come in handy here.\n\nThe problem states two equations:\n\n1. log_x(y^x) = 10\n2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\n\nI need to find xy. Let me write these equations out using the definition of logarithms.\n\nStarting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. By definition, this means that x raised to the 10th power equals y^x. So:\n\nx^{10} = y^x  ...(1)\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. This translates to y^10 = x^{4y}. So:\n\ny^{10} = x^{4y}  ...(2)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. x^{10} = y^x\n2. y^{10} = x^{4y}\n\nI need to solve for x and y, then find their product. Both x and y are greater than 1.\n\nHmm, these equations look a bit complicated because x and y are in both the base and the exponent. Maybe I can take logarithms of both sides to linearize them? Let's try that.\n\nTaking natural logarithm (ln) of both sides of equation (1):\n\nln(x^{10}) = ln(y^x)\n\nUsing the logarithm power rule, ln(a^b) = b ln(a):\n\n10 ln(x) = x ln(y)  ...(1a)\n\nSimilarly, take ln of both sides of equation (2):\n\nln(y^{10}) = ln(x^{4y})\n\nAgain, applying the power rule:\n\n10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x)  ...(2a)\n\nSo now equations (1a) and (2a) are:\n\n1. 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)\n2. 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x)\n\nHmm, maybe I can express ln(y) from the first equation and substitute into the second equation.\n\nFrom equation (1a):\n\nln(y) = (10 ln(x)) / x\n\nSubstitute this into equation (2a):\n\n10 * [(10 ln(x)) / x] = 4y ln(x)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(100 ln(x)) / x = 4y ln(x)\n\nAssuming ln(x) \u2260 0 (which is true because x > 1, so ln(x) > 0), we can divide both sides by ln(x):\n\n100 / x = 4y\n\nThen solve for y:\n\ny = (100 / x) / 4 = 25 / x\n\nSo y = 25/x. Now, substitute this back into equation (1a) or (1). Let's use equation (1a):\n\n10 ln(x) = x ln(y)\n\nBut y = 25/x, so ln(y) = ln(25/x) = ln(25) - ln(x)\n\nTherefore:\n\n10 ln(x) = x [ln(25) - ln(x)]\n\nLet's distribute the x on the right side:\n\n10 ln(x) = x ln(25) - x ln(x)\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n10 ln(x) + x ln(x) - x ln(25) = 0\n\nFactor out ln(x) from the first two terms:\n\nln(x)(10 + x) - x ln(25) = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor differently or express ln(25) as ln(5^2) = 2 ln(5). Let me try that.\n\nSo:\n\nln(x)(10 + x) - x * 2 ln(5) = 0\n\nBut I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express ln(25) as ln(25) = ln(25) and keep going.\n\nAlternatively, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n10 ln(x) + x ln(x) = x ln(25)\n\nFactor ln(x) on the left:\n\nln(x)(10 + x) = x ln(25)\n\nThen:\n\nln(x) = [x ln(25)] / (10 + x)\n\nHmm, this is an equation where x is both inside the logarithm and outside. This might not have an algebraic solution and might require some numerical methods, but since the problem states that such x and y exist and we need to find xy, maybe there's a substitution or a smart way to find xy without solving for x and y individually.\n\nWait, earlier we found that y = 25/x. So xy = x*(25/x) = 25. Wait, is that possible? If xy = 25, then the answer is 25? But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, if y = 25/x, then xy = x*(25/x) = 25. So regardless of x and y, as long as y = 25/x, xy would be 25. But we need to verify if this substitution is valid, i.e., if there exists x > 1 and y = 25/x > 1 satisfying the original equations.\n\nBut let's check if xy = 25 is indeed the answer. Let me verify.\n\nSuppose xy = 25. Then y = 25/x. Let's substitute y = 25/x into equation (1):\n\nx^{10} = y^x = (25/x)^x = 25^x / x^x\n\nSo x^{10} = 25^x / x^x\n\nMultiply both sides by x^x:\n\nx^{10} * x^x = 25^x\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx^{10 + x} = 25^x\n\nTake natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n(10 + x) ln(x) = x ln(25)\n\nWhich is exactly the equation we had earlier. So this equation must hold true for some x > 1. Therefore, if we can find such an x, then xy = 25. But how do we know such an x exists?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a specific x and y that satisfy this. Let me test some numbers.\n\nSuppose x = 5. Then y = 25/5 = 5. So x = y = 5. Let's check equation (1):\n\nlog_5(5^5) = log_5(5^5) = 5, which is not 10. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe x and y are different. Let's try x = 2. Then y = 25/2 = 12.5.\n\nCheck equation (1): log_2(12.5^2) = log_2(156.25). Since 2^7 = 128 and 2^8 = 256, so log_2(156.25) is between 7 and 8. Not 10. So that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe x = 10. Then y = 25/10 = 2.5.\n\nCheck equation (1): log_10(2.5^10). Let's compute 2.5^10. 2.5^2 = 6.25, 2.5^4 = 6.25^2 = 39.0625, 2.5^5 = 39.0625 * 2.5 = 97.65625, 2.5^10 = (97.65625)^2 \u2248 9536.743. Then log_10(9536.743) \u2248 log_10(10^4) = 4, but 9536.743 is about 9.536743 * 10^3, so log10 \u2248 3.979, which is still less than 4. So log_10(9536.743) \u2248 3.979, which is not 10. So that's not working.\n\nHmm, maybe x is smaller? Let's try x = 5. Then y = 5. Wait, we tried that already.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x is a fractional number greater than 1? Let's try x = 2.5. Then y = 25 / 2.5 = 10.\n\nCheck equation (1): log_{2.5}(10^{2.5}). Let's compute 10^{2.5} = 10^(2 + 0.5) = 10^2 * 10^0.5 \u2248 100 * 3.1623 \u2248 316.23. Now, log base 2.5 of 316.23. Let's see, 2.5^5 \u2248 97.65625, 2.5^6 \u2248 244.140625, 2.5^7 \u2248 610.3515625. So 316.23 is between 2.5^6 and 2.5^7. So log_{2.5}(316.23) \u2248 6.3, which is not 10. Not helpful.\n\nThis trial and error isn't working. Maybe there's a smarter approach.\n\nLet me recall that we have:\n\nFrom equation (1a): 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)\n\nFrom equation (2a): 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x)\n\nLet me denote a = ln(x) and b = ln(y). Then, since x > 1 and y > 1, a and b are positive.\n\nThen equations become:\n\n1. 10a = x b\n2. 10b = 4y a\n\nBut we also have y = 25/x from earlier. So substituting y = 25/x into the second equation:\n\n10b = 4*(25/x)*a => 10b = (100 a)/x => Multiply both sides by x:\n\n10b x = 100a => b x = 10a\n\nBut from the first equation, 10a = x b, which is the same as b x = 10a. So substituting into the second equation gives us an identity. So essentially, both equations reduce to the same relationship once we substitute y = 25/x. Therefore, the system is consistent, and we just need to solve the equation (10 + x) ln(x) = x ln(25) as before.\n\nBut how do we solve (10 + x) ln(x) = x ln(25)?\n\nThis seems transcendental. Maybe we can let t = x, then the equation is (10 + t) ln(t) = t ln(25). Let's rearrange:\n\n(10 + t) ln(t) - t ln(25) = 0\n\nLet me define a function f(t) = (10 + t) ln(t) - t ln(25). We need to find t > 1 such that f(t) = 0.\n\nLet me check the behavior of f(t):\n\nAt t approaching 1 from the right:\n\nln(1) = 0, so f(1) = (10 + 1)*0 - 1*ln(25) = -ln(25) \u2248 -3.218 < 0\n\nAs t increases:\n\nCompute f(5):\n\nf(5) = (10 + 5) ln(5) - 5 ln(25) = 15 ln(5) - 5 ln(25) = 15 ln(5) - 5*2 ln(5) = 15 ln5 -10 ln5 =5 ln5 \u22485*1.609\u22488.045>0\n\nSo f(5) is positive. Since f(1) is negative and f(5) is positive, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a root between 1 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, check f(2):\n\nf(2) = (10 +2) ln2 -2 ln25 =12 ln2 -2 ln25\u224812*0.693 -2*3.218\u22488.316 -6.436\u22481.88>0\n\nSo f(2) is positive. So the root is between 1 and 2.\n\nWait, f(1) \u2248 -3.218, f(2)\u22481.88. So between 1 and 2.\n\nCheck f(1.5):\n\nf(1.5) = (10 +1.5) ln1.5 -1.5 ln25\u224811.5*0.4055 -1.5*3.218\u22484.663 -4.827\u2248-0.164\u2248-0.164<0\n\nSo f(1.5)\u2248-0.164\n\nf(1.5) <0, f(2) >0. So root between 1.5 and 2.\n\nUse linear approximation:\n\nBetween t=1.5 and t=2.\n\nAt t=1.5, f\u2248-0.164\n\nAt t=2, f\u22481.88\n\nThe difference in t is 0.5, difference in f is 1.88 - (-0.164)=2.044\n\nWe need to find delta t such that f(t) =0.\n\nAssuming linearity:\n\ndelta t = (0 - (-0.164))/2.044 *0.5\u22480.164/2.044*0.5\u22480.04\n\nSo approximate root at t\u22481.5 +0.04=1.54\n\nCheck f(1.54):\n\nCompute (10 +1.54) ln(1.54) -1.54 ln25\u224811.54*0.433 -1.54*3.218\u22485.00 -4.95\u22480.05>0\n\nSo f(1.54)\u22480.05\n\nBetween 1.5 and 1.54:\n\nAt t=1.5, f\u2248-0.164\n\nAt t=1.54, f\u22480.05\n\nDifference in t=0.04, difference in f=0.214\n\nNeed to find t where f=0:\n\ndelta t= (0 - (-0.164))/0.214 *0.04\u22480.164/0.214*0.04\u22480.03\n\nSo t\u22481.5 +0.03=1.53\n\nCheck f(1.53):\n\n(10 +1.53) ln1.53 -1.53 ln25\u224811.53*0.425 -1.53*3.218\u22484.90 -4.92\u2248-0.02\u2248-0.02\n\nClose to zero. So t\u22481.53\n\nSo x\u22481.53, y=25/x\u224825/1.53\u224816.34\n\nBut wait, the problem says both x and y are greater than 1, which they are. But we need to find xy, which is 25. Wait, but according to our previous substitution, xy=25 regardless. So even though x and y are approximately 1.53 and 16.34, their product is 25. So maybe the answer is 25?\n\nBut let me check again. If xy=25, then y=25/x. Substitute into equation (1):\n\nx^{10} = y^x = (25/x)^x =25^x /x^x\n\nSo x^{10} *x^x=25^x\n\nx^{10+x}=25^x\n\nTake natural log:\n\n(10 +x) lnx =x ln25\n\nWhich is the equation we had. So if xy=25, then this equation must hold. But how do we know that xy=25 is the answer? Because even though we derived y=25/x from the equations, we still need to confirm that such x and y exist. But since the problem states that such x and y exist, and we are to find xy, which is 25, then 25 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to see that xy=25 without solving for x and y.\n\nLooking back at the original equations:\n\nlog_x(y^x) =10 and log_y(x^{4y})=10\n\nLet me rewrite these equations using logarithm properties.\n\nFirst equation: log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) =10\n\nSecond equation: log_y(x^{4y}) =4y * log_y(x) =10\n\nSo:\n\nx * log_x(y) =10 ...(1)\n\n4y * log_y(x) =10 ...(2)\n\nBut log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote k = log_y(x). Then log_x(y) =1/k.\n\nSubstitute into equations:\n\nEquation (1): x*(1/k) =10 => x/k=10 => x=10k\n\nEquation (2):4y*k=10 => y=10/(4k)=2.5/k\n\nSo x=10k and y=2.5/k\n\nTherefore, xy=10k*(2.5/k)=10*2.5=25\n\nSo xy=25 regardless of k. Therefore, the answer is 25.\n\nWow, that's much simpler! So even without solving for x and y, by expressing log_x(y) in terms of log_y(x) and substituting variables, we can find that xy=25.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{25}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{25}"
