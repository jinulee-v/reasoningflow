        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\) and \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all these nested functions. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall the definitions of the functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\). The problem says:\n\n\\( f(x) = ||x| - \\tfrac{1}{2}| \\)\n\n\\( g(x) = ||x| - \\tfrac{1}{4}| \\)\n\nSo both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are absolute value functions composed with other absolute values. Maybe I should first understand what these functions look like graphically?\n\nStarting with \\( f(x) = ||x| - \\tfrac{1}{2}| \\). Let me consider the inner part first: \\( |x| \\). That's a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Then subtract \\( \\tfrac{1}{2} \\), so \\( |x| - \\tfrac{1}{2} \\). This shifts the graph down by 1/2. Then take the absolute value of that result. So wherever \\( |x| - \\tfrac{1}{2} \\) is negative, it will flip to positive. Let me sketch this mentally.\n\nThe graph of \\( |x| - 1/2 \\) is V-shaped, but shifted down. The vertex is at (0, -1/2). The points where it crosses the x-axis are when \\( |x| - 1/2 = 0 \\), so at \\( x = \\pm 1/2 \\). So between -1/2 and 1/2, the expression \\( |x| - 1/2 \\) is negative, so taking absolute value of that would flip it upwards. So the graph of \\( f(x) \\) would be a V-shape between -1/2 and 1/2, peaking at (0, 1/2), and then continuing as the original V-shape outside of that interval but flipped? Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, actually, let me consider the function step by step:\n\nLet me denote \\( h(x) = |x| - 1/2 \\). Then \\( f(x) = |h(x)| = | |x| - 1/2 | \\).\n\nSo when \\( |x| \\geq 1/2 \\), \\( h(x) \\geq 0 \\), so \\( f(x) = |x| - 1/2 \\). That's the original V-shape minus 1/2, but only where |x| is at least 1/2. So for |x| \u2265 1/2, it's the same as |x| shifted down by 1/2. But when |x| < 1/2, then h(x) is negative, so f(x) becomes -h(x) = 1/2 - |x|. So in that interval, it's an upside-down V, peaking at (0, 1/2). So overall, the graph of f(x) is a \"W\" shape? Wait, no, actually, let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, for x positive, let's consider x \u2265 0. Then |x| = x. So for x \u2265 1/2, f(x) = x - 1/2. For 0 \u2264 x < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - x. Similarly for x \u2264 0. So actually, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape with vertices at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), and a peak at (0, 1/2). Wait, that's actually forming a \"V\" turned upside down between -1/2 and 1/2? Wait, no, actually, when you take absolute value of |x| - 1/2, the graph is actually two Vs. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to plot points:\n\nAt x = 0: f(0) = | |0| - 1/2 | = | -1/2 | = 1/2.\n\nAt x = 1/2: f(1/2) = | |1/2| - 1/2 | = 0.\n\nAt x = 1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, at x = -1/2 and x = -1, same as positive side.\n\nSo the graph of f(x) is a \"W\" shape? Wait, actually, between -1 and 1, it's forming a \"V\" with the bottom at the center? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nFrom x = -infty to -1/2: f(x) = |x| - 1/2, so slope 1.\n\nFrom x = -1/2 to 1/2: f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, so slope -1 on the right and +1 on the left?\n\nWait, actually, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, the function is 1/2 - |x|, so it's a V pointing downward with vertex at (0, 1/2). Then outside of that interval, it's |x| - 1/2, which is a V pointing upward with vertices at (\u00b11/2, 0). So the overall graph is like a \"W\" but with the middle part being a downward V and the sides upward Vs? Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you take the absolute value of |x| - 1/2, the graph will have a \"V\" shape at the points where |x| - 1/2 is zero, which is at x = \u00b11/2. So between -1/2 and 1/2, since |x| - 1/2 is negative, the absolute value flips it to 1/2 - |x|, which is a downward opening V with vertex at (0, 1/2). Outside of that interval, it's |x| - 1/2, which is upward opening V's starting from (\u00b11/2, 0). So the entire graph is a combination of a downward V between -1/2 and 1/2, and upward V's on either side. So the graph of f(x) has a peak at (0, 1/2) and valleys at (\u00b11/2, 0), and then goes up again as |x| increases beyond 1/2. So it's like a \"W\" but only between -1 and 1? Wait, actually, beyond x = 1, it continues as |x| - 1/2, so at x = 1, f(1) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, same as at x = 0. Hmm, interesting.\n\nSimilarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let me do the same analysis.\n\nLet h(x) = |x| - 1/4. Then g(x) = |h(x)|. So when |x| \u2265 1/4, h(x) is non-negative, so g(x) = |x| - 1/4. When |x| < 1/4, h(x) is negative, so g(x) = 1/4 - |x|.\n\nTherefore, the graph of g(x) is similar but with the critical point at 1/4 instead of 1/2. So between -1/4 and 1/4, it's a downward V with peak at (0, 1/4), and outside that interval, upward V's starting at (\u00b11/4, 0). So the graph of g(x) has a peak at (0, 1/4), valleys at (\u00b11/4, 0), and then increases beyond that.\n\nOkay, so now the functions f and g are defined. Now, the problem involves composing these functions with sine and cosine functions, then scaling by 4. Let me parse the equations again:\n\nFirst equation: \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n\nSecond equation: \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nWe need to find the number of intersections between these two graphs. Since one is a function of x giving y, and the other is a function of y giving x, their intersections occur where both equations are satisfied simultaneously. That is, we need to solve for (x, y) such that:\n\n\\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n\nand\n\n\\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nSo essentially, we need to find all pairs (x, y) where y is determined by x through the first equation, and x is determined by y through the second equation. This is a system of equations, and we need to find the number of solutions (x, y) in the plane.\n\nGiven the periodic nature of sine and cosine functions, perhaps the functions involved are periodic, so the solutions might repeat periodically, and we can find the number of solutions within a fundamental period and then multiply by the number of periods in the domain? Wait, but the problem doesn't specify a domain. Hmm, but since the functions are periodic, maybe the intersections also repeat periodically, so we can consider the number of intersections within one period and then see how many periods are needed? Wait, but actually, since both x and y are variables here, and both equations involve periodic functions, perhaps the entire system is periodic in both x and y directions?\n\nLet me check the periods of each function.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the first equation: \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n\nThe innermost function is sin(2\u03c0x). The period of sin(2\u03c0x) is 1, since the period of sin(kx) is 2\u03c0/k, so here k = 2\u03c0, so period is 1. Then f is applied to sin(2\u03c0x). Since f is a piecewise function but it's applied to the output of sin, which is between -1 and 1. Since f is even (because it's based on |x|), the composition f(sin(2\u03c0x)) will still have period 1, because sin(2\u03c0x) has period 1, and f is even, so it doesn't affect the period. Then g is applied to that, which is also even, so the entire function 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) will have period 1 in x. Therefore, the first equation's graph is periodic with period 1 in the x-direction.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation is \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\). Let's analyze its period. The innermost function is cos(3\u03c0y). The period of cos(3\u03c0y) is 2\u03c0/(3\u03c0) = 2/3. So the period in y is 2/3. Then f and g are applied, which are even functions, so the composition f(cos(3\u03c0y)) will have the same period as cos(3\u03c0y), which is 2/3. Therefore, the entire function 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) has period 2/3 in y. Therefore, the second equation's graph is periodic with period 2/3 in the y-direction.\n\nTherefore, the entire system of equations is periodic with periods 1 in x and 2/3 in y. To find all intersections, we can consider the fundamental period rectangle where x \u2208 [0,1) and y \u2208 [0, 2/3), and then the total number of intersections would be the number in this rectangle multiplied by the least common multiple of the periods? Wait, actually, since the periods are 1 and 2/3, the LCM of 1 and 2/3 is 2, since 1*2 = 2 and (2/3)*3 = 2. Wait, LCM of 1 and 2/3 is 2? Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of how many periods in x and y directions to cover a common interval. Alternatively, maybe the intersections will repeat every 1 in x and every 2/3 in y, so over a rectangle of size 1 x 2/3, the pattern repeats. Therefore, if we can find the number of intersections in that rectangle, then since the entire plane is covered by repeating this rectangle, but since the problem doesn't specify a domain, perhaps we need to assume that the question is asking for all intersections within a single period? Wait, but the problem just says \"the number of intersections of the graphs\", without specifying a domain. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe in such cases, the functions are considered over all real numbers, but since they are periodic, there would be infinitely many intersections. But the problem must have a finite answer, so probably they are considering intersections within a specific interval, perhaps the principal domain where x and y are between 0 and 1? Wait, but the problem didn't specify. Hmm, maybe I need to check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of intersections of the graphs\" of those two equations. Since both equations are functions (the first is y as a function of x, the second is x as a function of y), their intersections would occur at points (x,y) where both equations are satisfied. Since both functions are periodic, the intersections would repeat periodically. However, unless restricted to a specific interval, there would be infinitely many intersections. Therefore, the problem must be expecting the number of intersections within a fundamental period. Since the periods are 1 in x and 2/3 in y, perhaps the fundamental period is over x from 0 to 1 and y from 0 to 2/3? But then the LCM of 1 and 2/3 is 2, so over x from 0 to 2 and y from 0 to 2, but that complicates. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the intersections within the square [0,1] x [0,1], since both functions might have some symmetry there? Hmm, the problem might be expecting that, but since it's not specified, perhaps I need to check the problem's source or standard conventions. Wait, since the problem is from an Olympiad, perhaps they consider the intersections within the interval where x and y are between 0 and 1? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the functions have a period such that over [0,1] for x and [0, 2/3] for y, but since the problem mentions x and y without restriction, perhaps the answer is the number of intersections in the fundamental period rectangle, which is 1 in x and 2/3 in y, so the number of intersections in that rectangle multiplied by the number of such rectangles in a unit square? Hmm, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the number of intersections is finite, so perhaps the functions intersect only a finite number of times over all real numbers? That seems unlikely because of periodicity. Wait, perhaps the functions are bounded? Let me check the ranges.\n\nFirst, let's see the range of the first function \\( y = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\). Let's find the possible values of this function.\n\nFirst, sin(2\u03c0x) ranges between -1 and 1. Then f is applied to that. Let me recall f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|. Since |z| is between 0 and 1, then |z| - 1/2 ranges from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking absolute value, f(z) ranges from 0 to 1/2. Then g is applied to f(z). Since f(z) is between 0 and 1/2, then |f(z)| - 1/4? Wait, no, g is ||w| - 1/4| where w is f(z). Wait, actually, g(w) = ||w| - 1/4|. Since w is already non-negative (because f(z) is an absolute value), so |w| is just w. Therefore, g(w) = |w - 1/4|. Wait, hold on, let me re-express:\n\nWait, f(z) is already non-negative because it's an absolute value. So when we compute g(f(z)), since f(z) is non-negative, then |f(z)| is just f(z). Therefore, g(f(z)) = |f(z) - 1/4|. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\ng(f(z)) = | f(z) - 1/4 |.\n\nTherefore, the first function is y = 4 * | f(z) - 1/4 |, where z = sin(2\u03c0x).\n\nSince f(z) ranges between 0 and 1/2, then f(z) - 1/4 ranges between -1/4 and 1/4. Taking absolute value, so g(f(z)) ranges between 0 and 1/4. Therefore, multiplying by 4, the first function y ranges between 0 and 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). Let's analyze its range.\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) ranges between -1 and 1. Then f(cos(3\u03c0y)) is the same as f(z) where z is between -1 and 1, so f(z) is between 0 and 1/2 as before. Then g(f(z)) = |f(z) - 1/4|, so same as before, so the second function x = 4 * |f(z) - 1/4|, so x also ranges between 0 and 1.\n\nTherefore, both x and y are confined between 0 and 1. Therefore, the graphs of these equations lie entirely within the square [0,1] x [0,1]. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the number of intersections within this unit square. That makes sense, so we can restrict our attention to x \u2208 [0,1] and y \u2208 [0,1].\n\nTherefore, now the problem reduces to finding the number of points (x, y) in [0,1] x [0,1] such that:\n\ny = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y)))\n\nAlright, so now I need to analyze these equations within the unit square. Let me first try to understand the functions more concretely.\n\nFirst, let's define the first function:\n\nLet me denote \\( A(x) = 4g(f(\\sin(2\\pi x))) \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( B(y) = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\)\n\nWe need to find the number of solutions (x, y) in [0,1]x[0,1] such that y = A(x) and x = B(y). So substituting, we can write y = A(B(y)), so we can consider the function \\( y = A(B(y)) \\), and find the fixed points of this function within y \u2208 [0,1]. Alternatively, since it's symmetric, perhaps we can consider the intersections graphically?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to analyze the functions step by step.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the function A(x) = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nStart with sin(2\u03c0x). Since x \u2208 [0,1], 2\u03c0x goes from 0 to 2\u03c0, so sin(2\u03c0x) completes a full period from 0 to 0, peaking at 1 when x=1/4, -1 at x=3/4, etc.\n\nThen f(sin(2\u03c0x)) = || sin(2\u03c0x) | - 1/2 |.\n\nLet me compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nLet me denote z = sin(2\u03c0x). Then f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo first compute |z|, which is |sin(2\u03c0x)|, then subtract 1/2, take absolute value.\n\nTherefore, f(z) = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 |.\n\nThen g(f(z)) = | f(z) - 1/4 |, since as we saw earlier, since f(z) is between 0 and 1/2, so g(f(z)) = |f(z) - 1/4|.\n\nTherefore, A(x) = 4 * | | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nHmm, that's a mouthful. Let me see if I can simplify this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the composition step by step.\n\nLet me first compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nLet me denote s = sin(2\u03c0x). Then f(s) = | |s| - 1/2 |.\n\nSo f(s) is the absolute value of (|s| - 1/2). Let me consider the graph of |s| first. Since s ranges between -1 and 1, |s| ranges between 0 and 1. Then |s| - 1/2 ranges between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, so f(s) is between 0 and 1/2.\n\nThen g(f(s)) = | f(s) - 1/4 |. Since f(s) is between 0 and 1/2, f(s) - 1/4 ranges between -1/4 and 1/4. Taking absolute value, so g(f(s)) is between 0 and 1/4. Then multiplying by 4, A(x) is between 0 and 1, as we saw before.\n\nSimilarly for B(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))). Let me note that cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3, so over y \u2208 [0,1], it completes 1.5 periods. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote c = cos(3\u03c0y). Then f(c) = | |c| - 1/2 |, same as before. Then g(f(c)) = | f(c) - 1/4 |, so B(y) = 4 * | | |c| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |, same structure as A(x).\n\nTherefore, both A(x) and B(y) are functions that take their inputs (sin and cos functions) through these nested absolute values, resulting in outputs between 0 and 1.\n\nTo find the intersections, we need to find all (x, y) in [0,1]x[0,1] such that y = A(x) and x = B(y). Since both A and B map [0,1] to [0,1], the possible solutions lie within the unit square.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to analyze the functions A(x) and B(y) in detail, find their graphs, and then see how they intersect.\n\nAlternatively, since both equations are symmetric in a way, maybe we can consider substituting one into the other?\n\nLet me consider substituting y = A(x) into the second equation:\n\nx = B(y) = B(A(x)).\n\nTherefore, the equation reduces to x = B(A(x)), so we can consider the function F(x) = B(A(x)) and find the fixed points where F(x) = x. Similarly, since y = A(x), once we find x such that x = B(A(x)), then y is determined as A(x). Therefore, the number of solutions is the number of fixed points of F(x) in [0,1].\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric in x and y (since swapping x and y would swap the equations, but since both are functions, maybe not exactly symmetric), but perhaps the number of intersections can be found by analyzing the fixed points.\n\nHowever, this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to analyze the functions A(x) and B(y) over their periods and see how they intersect.\n\nFirst, let's try to graph A(x) over [0,1].\n\nStarting with A(x) = 4g(f(sin(2\u03c0x))).\n\nLet me first compute f(sin(2\u03c0x)):\n\nLet me denote s = sin(2\u03c0x). Then f(s) = | |s| - 1/2 |.\n\nLet me consider the behavior of s = sin(2\u03c0x) over x from 0 to 1:\n\n- At x = 0: sin(0) = 0 \u21d2 f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2 \u21d2 g(f(0)) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4 \u21d2 A(0) = 4*(1/4) = 1.\n\n- At x = 1/4: sin(2\u03c0*(1/4)) = sin(\u03c0/2) = 1 \u21d2 f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2 \u21d2 same as above, so A(1/4) = 1.\n\n- At x = 1/8: sin(2\u03c0*(1/8)) = sin(\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.707. Then |s| = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.707. Then f(s) = |0.707 - 0.5| \u2248 0.207. Then g(f(s)) = |0.207 - 0.25| \u2248 0.043. Then A(x) \u2248 4*0.043 \u2248 0.172.\n\nWait, but let me do this more precisely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to split the interval [0,1] into regions where the inner functions have different behaviors.\n\nFirst, let's note that sin(2\u03c0x) is periodic with period 1, so we can analyze it over [0,1].\n\nLet me consider the function s = sin(2\u03c0x). Its graph over [0,1] is a sine wave starting at 0, peaking at 1/4 (value 1), returning to 0 at 1/2, dipping to -1 at 3/4, and back to 0 at 1.\n\nTherefore, |s| = |sin(2\u03c0x)| is a non-negative function, which is symmetric around x = 1/4, 3/4, etc. Specifically, |sin(2\u03c0x)| has peaks at 1/4 and 3/4, with value 1, and zeros at 0, 1/2, 1.\n\nTherefore, |s| ranges from 0 to 1, and its graph is a \"wave\" that goes up to 1 at 1/4, back down to 0 at 1/2, up to 1 again at 3/4, then down to 0 at 1.\n\nTherefore, f(s) = | |s| - 1/2 |. Let me consider |s| as a variable between 0 and 1. Let me denote t = |s|, so t \u2208 [0,1].\n\nThen f(t) = | t - 1/2 |. Wait, actually, f(t) = | t - 1/2 |, since t is non-negative. Wait, no, f(t) is defined as ||t| - 1/2|, but since t is already non-negative (as |s|), so f(t) = | t - 1/2 |. Therefore, f(t) is a V-shaped function with minimum at t = 1/2, value 0, and increasing to 1/2 at t=0 and t=1.\n\nTherefore, f(|s|) = | |s| - 1/2 |. So when |s| \u2264 1/2, f(|s|) = 1/2 - |s|. When |s| \u2265 1/2, f(|s|) = |s| - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, over the interval [0,1], since |s| = |sin(2\u03c0x)|, let's see when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2 and when it's \u2265 1/2.\n\nThe equation |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2 occurs when sin(2\u03c0x) = \u00b11/2. So 2\u03c0x = \u03c0/6, 5\u03c0/6, 7\u03c0/6, 11\u03c0/6, etc. Within [0, 2\u03c0], the solutions are at x = 1/12, 5/12, 7/12, 11/12. Therefore, in [0,1], the points where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2 are at x = 1/12, 5/12, 7/12, 11/12.\n\nTherefore, between these points, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is either above or below 1/2.\n\nLet me partition the interval [0,1] into regions based on these critical points:\n\n1. [0, 1/12]: Here, |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 0 to 1/2. Since it's starting at 0 and going up to 1/2, so |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2 here. Wait, actually, at x=0, it's 0, and at x=1/12, it's 1/2. So in [0, 1/12], |sin(2\u03c0x)| is increasing from 0 to 1/2, so \u22641/2.\n\n2. [1/12, 5/12]: Here, sin(2\u03c0x) continues to increase to 1 at x=1/4 (which is 3/12), then decreases back to 1/2 at x=5/12. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 5/12 is approximately 0.4167. Let me compute sin(2\u03c0*(5/12)) = sin(5\u03c0/6) = 1/2. Wait, actually, sin(2\u03c0*(5/12)) = sin(5\u03c0/6) = 1/2. Wait, but 5/12 is 0.4167, so between 1/12 (0.0833) and 5/12 (0.4167), the sine function goes from 1/2 up to 1 at 1/4 (0.25) and back down to 1/2 at 5/12. Therefore, in this interval, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is \u22651/2 except at the endpoints.\n\nSimilarly, between 5/12 and 7/12 (\u22480.5833):\n\nWait, 7/12 is approximately 0.5833. Let me see:\n\nAt x = 1/2 (0.5), sin(2\u03c0*(1/2)) = sin(\u03c0) = 0. So between 5/12 and 7/12, the sine function goes from 1/2 at 5/12 down to -1/2 at 7/12? Wait, actually, sin(2\u03c0*(7/12)) = sin(7\u03c0/6) = -1/2, so |sin(2\u03c0x)| at 7/12 is 1/2. So between 5/12 and 7/12, the sine function goes from 1/2 down to -1, but the absolute value would be symmetric. Wait, actually, let's track the absolute value:\n\nFrom x = 5/12 to 1/2 (0.5):\n\nsin(2\u03c0x) decreases from 1/2 to 0, so |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases to 0.\n\nFrom x = 1/2 to 7/12:\n\nsin(2\u03c0x) becomes negative, going from 0 down to -1/2 at 7/12, so |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 0 to 1/2.\n\nTherefore, between 5/12 and 7/12, |sin(2\u03c0x)| first decreases to 0 and then increases back to 1/2. Therefore, in this interval, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is \u22641/2 except at the endpoints.\n\nWait, but between 5/12 and 7/12, the maximum of |sin(2\u03c0x)| is 1/2 at the endpoints, and it reaches 0 in the middle. So in this interval, |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u22641/2.\n\nWait, but between 1/12 and 5/12, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is \u22651/2 except at the endpoints. Similarly, between 7/12 and 11/12, let's see:\n\nAt x = 3/4 (0.75), sin(2\u03c0*(3/4)) = sin(3\u03c0/2) = -1, so |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1. Then at x = 11/12, sin(2\u03c0*(11/12)) = sin(11\u03c0/6) = -1/2, so |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2.\n\nSo between 7/12 and 11/12, the sine function goes from -1/2 at 7/12 to -1 at 3/4, then back to -1/2 at 11/12. Taking absolute value, this becomes 1/2 to 1 to 1/2. Therefore, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is \u22651/2 in this interval except at the endpoints.\n\nFinally, between 11/12 and 1, |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 1/2 back to 0.\n\nTherefore, summarizing:\n\nThe intervals where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2 are:\n\n- [1/12, 5/12]\n\n- [7/12, 11/12]\n\nAnd the intervals where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2 are:\n\n- [0, 1/12]\n\n- [5/12, 7/12]\n\n- [11/12, 1]\n\nTherefore, in the regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2.\n\nIn the regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nThen, moving on to g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) = | f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) - 1/4 |.\n\nLet me denote u = f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|). Then g(u) = |u - 1/4|.\n\nSo depending on the value of u, which is either (|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2) or (1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|), we can compute g(u).\n\nLet me first consider the regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2 (i.e., [1/12, 5/12] and [7/12, 11/12]):\n\nIn these regions, u = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2. Since |sin(2\u03c0x)| ranges from 1/2 to 1 here, u ranges from 0 to 1/2. Therefore, u - 1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4. Therefore, g(u) = |u - 1/4|. So when u < 1/4, this becomes 1/4 - u, and when u \u2265 1/4, it's u - 1/4.\n\nTherefore, in these regions, we can split further based on whether u = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is less than or greater than 1/4.\n\nSo u = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 < 1/4 \u21d2 |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, u \u2265 1/4 \u21d2 |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 3/4.\n\nTherefore, within [1/12, 5/12], which is where |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 1/2 and 1, we can further split at |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly for [7/12, 11/12].\n\nLet me find the x where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4.\n\nSolving |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4 \u21d2 sin(2\u03c0x) = \u00b13/4.\n\nSo 2\u03c0x = arcsin(3/4) or \u03c0 - arcsin(3/4), etc.\n\nLet me compute the x values:\n\nFor sin(\u03b8) = 3/4, \u03b8 = arcsin(3/4) \u2248 0.848 radians \u2248 48.59 degrees.\n\nTherefore, in the interval [0, \u03c0/2], the solution is \u03b8 \u2248 0.848, so x \u2248 0.848/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.135.\n\nSimilarly, in the interval [\u03c0/2, \u03c0], sin(\u03b8) = 3/4 at \u03b8 = \u03c0 - 0.848 \u2248 2.293 radians, so x \u2248 2.293/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.364.\n\nSimilarly, in the negative side, sin(\u03b8) = -3/4 would be in the third and fourth quadrants, but since we are dealing with absolute value, those would correspond to the same |sin|.\n\nBut since we are in the regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, which includes both positive and negative parts, but since we take absolute value, it's symmetric.\n\nTherefore, in the interval [1/12, 5/12], which is from \u22480.083 to \u22480.416, the points where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4 are at x \u22480.135 and x\u22480.364.\n\nWait, let me compute more precisely:\n\nLet me compute x where sin(2\u03c0x) = 3/4:\n\n2\u03c0x = arcsin(3/4) \u21d2 x = (1/(2\u03c0)) * arcsin(3/4)\n\narcsin(3/4) \u2248 0.84806 radians,\n\nso x \u2248 0.84806/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.1348.\n\nSimilarly, the other solution in [0, \u03c0] is \u03c0 - arcsin(3/4) \u2248 2.2935 radians,\n\nso x \u2248 2.2935/(2\u03c0) \u2248 0.3648.\n\nTherefore, in the interval [1/12 \u22480.0833, 5/12\u22480.4167], the points where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4 are at \u22480.1348 and \u22480.3648.\n\nTherefore, splitting [1/12, 5/12] into:\n\n- [1/12, 0.1348]: Here, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 1/2 and 3/4, so u = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is between 0 and 1/4, so g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\n- [0.1348, 0.3648]: Here, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 3/4 and 1, so u is between 1/4 and 1/2, so g(u) = u - 1/4.\n\n- [0.3648, 5/12]: Wait, 0.3648 is less than 5/12\u22480.4167, so the interval continues up to 5/12. Wait, but actually, at x=5/12, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is 1/2 again. Wait, but in this interval [0.3648, 5/12], |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 1 back down to 1/2. Wait, actually, at x=1/4 (0.25), sin(2\u03c0x)=1, so the maximum. Then as x increases past 1/4, sin(2\u03c0x) starts decreasing. So between 0.3648 and 5/12\u22480.4167, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is decreasing from 3/4 back to 1/2. Wait, actually, at x=0.3648, sin(2\u03c0x)=3/4, then decreasing to 1/2 at x=5/12. Therefore, in this interval, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 3/4 and 1/2, so u = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is between 1/4 and 0? Wait, no, since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is decreasing from 3/4 to 1/2, so u = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is decreasing from 1/4 to 0. Therefore, in this interval, u is between 0 and 1/4, so g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nWait, so actually, the interval [0.3648, 5/12] would have u decreasing from 1/4 to 0, so g(u) = 1/4 - u, which is increasing from 0 to 1/4.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my earlier split was incorrect. Let me re-express:\n\nIn the interval [1/12, 5/12], which is from \u22480.0833 to \u22480.4167:\n\n- From x=1/12 to x\u22480.1348: |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 1/2 to 3/4, so u increases from 0 to 1/4. Thus, g(u) = 1/4 - u decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\n- From x\u22480.1348 to x=1/4 (0.25): |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 3/4 to 1, so u increases from 1/4 to 1/2. Thus, g(u) = u - 1/4 increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\n- From x=1/4 to x\u22480.3648: |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 1 to 3/4, so u decreases from 1/2 to 1/4. Thus, g(u) = u - 1/4 decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\n- From x\u22480.3648 to x=5/12: |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 3/4 to 1/2, so u decreases from 1/4 to 0. Thus, g(u) = 1/4 - u increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps I can see that in the interval [1/12, 5/12], the function g(u) first decreases to 0, then increases to 1/4, then decreases back to 0, then increases again to 1/4? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that in the regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the function g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) is | (|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2) - 1/4 | = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 |.\n\nWait, hold on, since f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 in this region, so g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) = | (|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2) - 1/4 | = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 |.\n\nSimilarly, in regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|, so g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) = | (1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|) - 1/4 | = | 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| |.\n\nTherefore, simplifying:\n\nA(x) = 4 * [ | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 | when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2,\n\nand 4 * | 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| | when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2 ]\n\nTherefore, this simplifies the expression a bit.\n\nTherefore, in regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, A(x) = 4| |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 |,\n\nand in regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2, A(x) = 4| 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| |.\n\nThis might be easier to handle.\n\nSimilarly for B(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nLet me analyze B(y):\n\nLet me denote c = cos(3\u03c0y). Then f(c) = | |c| - 1/2 |, and then g(f(c)) = | f(c) - 1/4 |, so B(y) = 4 * | | |c| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nSimilarly, breaking it down:\n\nFirst, |c| = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which ranges between 0 and 1.\n\nThen f(|c|) = | |c| - 1/2 |, so similar to before.\n\nThen g(f(|c|)) = | f(|c|) - 1/4 |.\n\nTherefore, similar to A(x), we can split based on |c|:\n\nIf |c| \u2265 1/2, then f(|c|) = |c| - 1/2, so g(f(|c|)) = | |c| - 1/2 - 1/4 | = | |c| - 3/4 |,\n\nand if |c| \u2264 1/2, then f(|c|) = 1/2 - |c|, so g(f(|c|)) = | 1/2 - |c| - 1/4 | = | 1/4 - |c| |.\n\nTherefore, B(y) = 4 * [ | |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 3/4 | when |cos(3\u03c0y)| \u2265 1/2,\n\nand 4 * | 1/4 - |cos(3\u03c0y)| | when |cos(3\u03c0y)| \u2264 1/2 ]\n\nTherefore, both A(x) and B(y) have similar structures, just with different trigonometric functions inside.\n\nNow, to find the intersections, we need to consider the equations y = A(x) and x = B(y). Since both A and B are functions from [0,1] to [0,1], we can consider their graphs and see where they intersect.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric in a way (if we swap x and y, the equations swap), but since A and B are not the same functions (due to different trigonometric arguments), the intersections might not be symmetric. However, perhaps the number of intersections can be found by analyzing the number of times the two graphs cross each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the functions A(x) and B(y) as piecewise functions and find their intersections by considering different intervals.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe it's better to first sketch or analyze the behavior of A(x) and B(y) over their intervals.\n\nStarting with A(x):\n\nAs established earlier, A(x) is defined piecewise based on |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nLet me consider the interval [0,1] divided into the regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| is above or below 1/2, and further split where needed.\n\nFirst, let's note the critical points where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2 and |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4, which we found earlier at x = 1/12, 5/12, 7/12, 11/12, and approximately 0.1348, 0.3648, 0.6352, 0.8652 (the latter two being symmetric counterparts in the second half of the interval).\n\nWait, actually, in the second half (from 0.5 to 1), similar points would occur. Let me confirm:\n\nFor the interval [7/12, 11/12], which is the mirror of [1/12, 5/12], the points where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4 would be symmetric. Since sin(2\u03c0x) is negative there, but we take absolute value, so the same x positions as in the first half but mirrored around 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the critical points for A(x) are at x = 1/12, ~0.1348, 5/12, 7/12, ~0.8652, 11/12, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the function A(x) will have different expressions in each of these intervals, leading to a piecewise linear or V-shaped graph.\n\nSimilarly for B(y), which is based on cos(3\u03c0y). Let's analyze B(y):\n\nThe function B(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) is similar but with cos(3\u03c0y). Let's analyze its critical points.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3, so over y \u2208 [0,1], it completes 1.5 periods.\n\nLet me consider the behavior of cos(3\u03c0y):\n\n- At y = 0: cos(0) = 1.\n\n- At y = 1/6: cos(3\u03c0*(1/6)) = cos(\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 1/3: cos(\u03c0) = -1.\n\n- At y = 1/2: cos(3\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 2/3: cos(2\u03c0) = 1.\n\n- At y = 5/6: cos(5\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 1: cos(3\u03c0) = -1.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute step by step:\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) for y from 0 to 1:\n\n- At y = 0: cos(0) = 1.\n\n- At y = 1/6: 3\u03c0*(1/6) = \u03c0/2 \u21d2 cos(\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 1/3: 3\u03c0*(1/3) = \u03c0 \u21d2 cos(\u03c0) = -1.\n\n- At y = 1/2: 3\u03c0*(1/2) = 3\u03c0/2 \u21d2 cos(3\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 2/3: 3\u03c0*(2/3) = 2\u03c0 \u21d2 cos(2\u03c0) = 1.\n\n- At y = 5/6: 3\u03c0*(5/6) = 5\u03c0/2 \u21d2 cos(5\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 1: 3\u03c0*1 = 3\u03c0 \u21d2 cos(3\u03c0) = -1.\n\nTherefore, the graph of cos(3\u03c0y) over [0,1] is a cosine wave that starts at 1, goes down to -1 at 1/3, back to 1 at 2/3, and down to -1 at 1. So it has a period of 2/3, so over [0, 2/3], it completes a full period from 1 to -1 and back to 1, then from 2/3 to 1, it goes from 1 to -1 again.\n\nTherefore, |cos(3\u03c0y)| is the absolute value of this, so it will have peaks at 0, 2/3, and 1 (value 1), and valleys at 1/3 and 5/6 (value 1). Wait, actually, at y=1/3, cos(3\u03c0y) is -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| is 1. Wait, actually, the absolute value will make all the negative parts positive. So the graph of |cos(3\u03c0y)| over [0,1] will be:\n\n- From y=0 to 1/3: cos(3\u03c0y) decreases from 1 to -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| decreases to 0 at y=1/6, then increases back to 1 at y=1/3.\n\nWait, no, let me track it properly:\n\nWait, cos(3\u03c0y) from y=0 to y=1/3:\n\nAt y=0: 1\n\nAt y=1/6: 0\n\nAt y=1/3: -1 \u21d2 |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1\n\nWait, so actually, the absolute value would make it:\n\nFrom y=0 to y=1/6: cos(3\u03c0y) decreases from 1 to 0, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| same.\n\nFrom y=1/6 to y=1/3: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from 0 to -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| increases from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, from y=1/3 to y=1/2: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from -1 to 0, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| decreases from 1 to 0.\n\nFrom y=1/2 to y=2/3: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from 0 to 1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| increases to 1.\n\nFrom y=2/3 to y=5/6: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from 1 to 0, then to -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| decreases to 0 at y=5/6, then increases back to 1 at y=2/3? Wait, no:\n\nWait, at y=2/3, cos(3\u03c0*(2/3)) = cos(2\u03c0) = 1.\n\nAt y=5/6: cos(3\u03c0*(5/6)) = cos(5\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\nAt y=1: cos(3\u03c0) = -1 \u21d2 |cos(3\u03c0)| = 1.\n\nTherefore, from y=2/3 to y=5/6: cos(3\u03c0y) decreases from 1 to 0, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| same.\n\nFrom y=5/6 to y=1: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from 0 to -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| increases from 0 to 1.\n\nTherefore, the graph of |cos(3\u03c0y)| over [0,1] consists of \"humps\" peaking at y=0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1, with valleys at y=1/6, 1/2, 5/6.\n\nTherefore, the critical points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 and 3/4 will determine the regions for B(y).\n\nFirst, let's find where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 and 3/4.\n\nStarting with |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2:\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) = \u00b11/2 \u21d2 3\u03c0y = \u00b1\u03c0/3 + 2\u03c0k or \u00b12\u03c0/3 + 2\u03c0k.\n\nSolving for y:\n\nFor cos(\u03b8) = 1/2: \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 or 5\u03c0/3.\n\nThus, 3\u03c0y = \u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 1/9 \u22480.1111,\n\nor 3\u03c0y = 5\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 5/9 \u22480.5556,\n\nSimilarly, cos(\u03b8) = -1/2 \u21d2 \u03b8 = 2\u03c0/3 or 4\u03c0/3,\n\nso 3\u03c0y = 2\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 2/9 \u22480.2222,\n\nor 3\u03c0y = 4\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 4/9 \u22480.4444,\n\nand also adding 2\u03c0 to the angles would go beyond the interval [0, 3\u03c0].\n\nTherefore, the solutions in [0,1] are y = 1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, and also considering the periodicity beyond?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nWait, for \u03b8 = 3\u03c0y, over y \u2208 [0,1], \u03b8 ranges from 0 to 3\u03c0.\n\nSo solving cos(\u03b8) = \u00b11/2 within \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 3\u03c0].\n\nThe solutions are:\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 1/2:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3, 7\u03c0/3 (but 7\u03c0/3 \u22487.33 is beyond 3\u03c0\u22489.42, so no),\n\nWait, 5\u03c0/3 is \u22485.23, which is less than 3\u03c0\u22489.42,\n\nWait, actually, 3\u03c0 is about 9.4248, so 7\u03c0/3 \u22487.33 is still within.\n\nWait, cos(7\u03c0/3)=cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2,\n\nSimilarly, cos(11\u03c0/3)=cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2, but 11\u03c0/3\u224811.52>3\u03c0\u22489.42, so no.\n\nWait, actually, cos(\u03b8)=1/2 at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3, 7\u03c0/3, 11\u03c0/3,... but within [0,3\u03c0], the solutions are \u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3, 7\u03c0/3.\n\nWait, 7\u03c0/3 is 2\u03c0 + \u03c0/3, so cos(7\u03c0/3)=cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2.\n\nSimilarly, cos(\u03b8)= -1/2 at \u03b8=2\u03c0/3, 4\u03c0/3, 8\u03c0/3, 10\u03c0/3,...\n\nWithin [0,3\u03c0], these are 2\u03c0/3, 4\u03c0/3, 8\u03c0/3 (\u22488.377), 10\u03c0/3 (\u224810.472) which is beyond 3\u03c0\u22489.4248, so only up to 8\u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for cos\u03b8 = -1/2 in [0,3\u03c0] are 2\u03c0/3, 4\u03c0/3, 8\u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, converting back to y:\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 1/2:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = (\u03c0/3)/(3\u03c0) = 1/9 \u22480.1111,\n\n\u03b8 = 5\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = (5\u03c0/3)/(3\u03c0) = 5/9 \u22480.5556,\n\n\u03b8 = 7\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = (7\u03c0/3)/(3\u03c0) = 7/9 \u22480.7778.\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = -1/2:\n\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 2/9 \u22480.2222,\n\n\u03b8 = 4\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 4/9 \u22480.4444,\n\n\u03b8 = 8\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 8/9 \u22480.8889.\n\nTherefore, the points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 are at y = 1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, 7/9, 8/9.\n\nSimilarly, solving |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 3/4:\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) = \u00b13/4.\n\nLet me compute the solutions:\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 3/4:\n\n\u03b8 = arccos(3/4) \u22480.7227 radians,\n\nand \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22485.5605 radians,\n\nSimilarly, cos\u03b8 = -3/4 \u21d2 \u03b8 = \u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22482.4189,\n\nand \u03b8 = \u03c0 + arccos(3/4) \u22483.8593.\n\nWithin \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 3\u03c0], we can have multiple solutions.\n\nLet me compute all solutions for cos\u03b8 = 3/4 and cos\u03b8 = -3/4 in [0, 3\u03c0].\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 3/4:\n\n\u03b8\u2081 = arccos(3/4) \u22480.7227,\n\n\u03b8\u2082 = 2\u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22485.5605,\n\n\u03b8\u2083 = 2\u03c0 + arccos(3/4) \u22486.9939,\n\n\u03b8\u2084 = 4\u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u224811.5605 (which is beyond 3\u03c0\u22489.4248, so no).\n\nSo within [0, 3\u03c0], solutions are \u03b8\u2081\u22480.7227, \u03b8\u2082\u22485.5605, \u03b8\u2083\u22486.9939.\n\nSimilarly for cos\u03b8 = -3/4:\n\n\u03b8\u2081 = \u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22482.4189,\n\n\u03b8\u2082 = \u03c0 + arccos(3/4) \u22483.8593,\n\n\u03b8\u2083 = 3\u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22488.7617,\n\n\u03b8\u2084 = 3\u03c0 + arccos(3/4) (exceeds 3\u03c0).\n\nThus, within [0, 3\u03c0], solutions are \u03b8\u2081\u22482.4189, \u03b8\u2082\u22483.8593, \u03b8\u2083\u22488.7617.\n\nTherefore, converting to y:\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 3/4:\n\ny\u2081 = \u03b8\u2081/(3\u03c0) \u22480.7227/(3\u03c0) \u22480.0769,\n\ny\u2082 = \u03b8\u2082/(3\u03c0) \u22485.5605/(3\u03c0) \u22480.586,\n\ny\u2083 = \u03b8\u2083/(3\u03c0) \u22486.9939/(3\u03c0) \u22480.738.\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = -3/4:\n\ny\u2081 = \u03b8\u2081/(3\u03c0) \u22482.4189/(3\u03c0) \u22480.257,\n\ny\u2082 = \u03b8\u2082/(3\u03c0) \u22483.8593/(3\u03c0) \u22480.409,\n\ny\u2083 = \u03b8\u2083/(3\u03c0) \u22488.7617/(3\u03c0) \u22480.923.\n\nTherefore, the points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 3/4 are approximately at y \u22480.0769, 0.257, 0.409, 0.586, 0.738, 0.923.\n\nTherefore, these points divide the interval [0,1] into regions where |cos(3\u03c0y)| is above or below 1/2 and 3/4.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Maybe instead of tracking all these points, I can consider that both A(x) and B(y) are piecewise linear functions with multiple segments, and their intersections can be counted by analyzing each segment's possible intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the number of intersections by analyzing the number of times the two functions cross each other in their respective periods.\n\nGiven that A(x) has a period of 1 and B(y) has a period of 2/3, the combined system might have a period of 2 (the least common multiple of 1 and 2/3). However, since we are confined to the unit square [0,1]x[0,1], we can analyze within this square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that both A(x) and B(y) are functions that oscillate between 0 and 1 with certain frequencies, and their intersections can be counted by considering the number of times their graphs cross.\n\nAlternatively, since both functions are composed of absolute values and trigonometric functions, they might have multiple peaks and valleys, leading to multiple intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the number of solutions by analyzing the equations numerically in each interval.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe I can consider the number of intersections by analyzing the number of times each function crosses the other in their respective domains.\n\nAlternatively, since both functions are from [0,1] to [0,1], and they are both continuous and piecewise linear or V-shaped, perhaps each \"hump\" of A(x) can intersect with several \"humps\" of B(y), leading to multiple intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the equations y = A(x) and x = B(y), and substitute one into the other.\n\nLet me consider substituting y = A(x) into x = B(y):\n\nx = B(A(x)).\n\nTherefore, we can consider the function F(x) = B(A(x)), and find the fixed points where F(x) = x.\n\nSimilarly, since A(x) maps [0,1] to [0,1], and B(y) also maps [0,1] to [0,1], the function F(x) is a composition of two functions from [0,1] to [0,1], so it's also a function from [0,1] to [0,1]. The fixed points of F(x) correspond to the solutions of the system.\n\nThe number of fixed points can be determined by analyzing how many times the graph of F(x) crosses the line y = x.\n\nTo find the number of fixed points, we can analyze the behavior of F(x) over [0,1].\n\nHowever, since F(x) = B(A(x)), and both A and B are piecewise functions, this might require breaking down the interval [0,1] into subintervals where A(x) and B(y) are linear, then computing F(x) on each subinterval and checking intersections with y=x.\n\nThis seems tedious but feasible.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the structure of A(x):\n\nAs established earlier, A(x) is built from |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which has critical points at x = 1/12, ~0.1348, 5/12, 7/12, ~0.8652, 11/12, etc.\n\nSimilarly, B(y) is built from |cos(3\u03c0y)|, with critical points at y = 1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, 7/9, 8/9, and others where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 3/4.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps it's better to consider the number of intersections by considering the number of times each function's graph crosses the other.\n\nAlternatively, since both functions are composed of multiple linear segments, the total number of intersections can be calculated by counting the intersections between each segment of A(x) and each segment of B(y).\n\nHowever, this requires detailed analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that both A(x) and B(y) are non-negative and bounded between 0 and 1, and each has a certain number of \"peaks\" and \"valleys\".\n\nLet me try to count the number of peaks and valleys for A(x):\n\nLooking at A(x):\n\n- In the interval [0, 1/12], |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u22641/2, so A(x) = 4|1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)||.\n\nSince |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 0 to 1/2 here, the expression inside the absolute value is 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which decreases from 1/4 to 0. Therefore, A(x) decreases from 1 to 0 over [0, 1/12].\n\nWait, let me compute at x=0: A(0)=4*|1/4 -0|=1,\n\nAt x=1/12: |sin(2\u03c0*(1/12))|=sin(\u03c0/6)=1/2, so A(1/12)=4*|1/4 -1/2|=4*(1/4)=1.\n\nWait, so actually, at x=1/12, A(x)=1 again.\n\nWait, so between 0 and 1/12, A(x) starts at 1, decreases to 0 at the midpoint?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nWait, in [0,1/12], |sin(2\u03c0x)| goes from 0 to 1/2. The expression inside the absolute value for A(x) is 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|. Since |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 0 to 1/2, this expression decreases from 1/4 to -1/4. Therefore, the absolute value becomes |1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)||, which is |1/4 - s| where s goes from 0 to 1/2.\n\nTherefore, when s < 1/4, the expression is 1/4 - s, decreasing from 1/4 to 0,\n\nand when s \u22651/4, it's s - 1/4, increasing from 0 to 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the critical point is at s=1/4, which occurs when |sin(2\u03c0x)|=1/4.\n\nSolving sin(2\u03c0x)=1/4,\n\n2\u03c0x = arcsin(1/4) \u22480.2527 radians,\n\nso x \u22480.2527/(2\u03c0)\u22480.0402.\n\nSimilarly, the negative solution would be in the next interval, but since we're in [0,1/12], which is up to ~0.0833, the critical point at x\u22480.0402 is within [0,1/12].\n\nTherefore, in [0, 0.0402], A(x) decreases from 1 to 0,\n\nthen in [0.0402, 1/12], A(x) increases back to 1.\n\nWait, that's a V-shape in this interval.\n\nWait, let me compute at x=0.0402:\n\nA(x)=4*(1/4 - 1/4)=0,\n\nthen as x increases past 0.0402, |sin(2\u03c0x)| exceeds 1/4, so A(x)=4*(|sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/4), which increases to 4*(1/2 -1/4)=1 at x=1/12.\n\nTherefore, in [0,1/12], A(x) forms a \"V\" shape going down to 0 at x\u22480.0402 and back up to 1 at x=1/12.\n\nSimilarly, in the next interval [1/12, 5/12], where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u22651/2,\n\nA(x)=4| |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 |.\n\nHere, |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 1/2 to 1 (at x=1/4), then decreases back to 1/2 at x=5/12.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the absolute value is |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4.\n\nWhen |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 3/4, this is negative, so absolute value makes it 3/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|,\n\nand when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u22653/4, it's |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4.\n\nThe critical point is when |sin(2\u03c0x)|=3/4, which occurs at x\u22480.1348 and x\u22480.3648 as before.\n\nTherefore, in [1/12\u22480.0833, 0.1348], |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 1/2 to 3/4,\n\nso A(x)=4*(3/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|), decreasing from 4*(3/4 -1/2)=4*(1/4)=1 down to 0 at x\u22480.1348.\n\nThen from x\u22480.1348 to x=1/4 (0.25), |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 3/4 to 1,\n\nso A(x)=4*(|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4), increasing from 0 to 4*(1 - 3/4)=1.\n\nThen from x=1/4 to x\u22480.3648, |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 1 to 3/4,\n\nso A(x)=4*(|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4), decreasing back to 0.\n\nThen from x\u22480.3648 to "

Wait, but actually, at x=5/12, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is 1/2 again. Wait, but in this interval [0.3648, 5/12], |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 1 back down to 1/2. Wait, actually, at x=1/4 (0.25), sin(2\u03c0x)=1, so the maximum. Then as x increases past 1/4, sin(2\u03c0x) starts decreasing. So between 0.3648 and 5/12\u22480.4167, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is decreasing from 3/4 back to 1/2. Wait, actually, at x=0.3648, sin(2\u03c0x)=3/4, then decreasing to 1/2 at x=5/12. Therefore, in this interval, |sin(2\u03c0x)| is between 3/4 and 1/2, so u = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is between 1/4 and 0? Wait, no, since |sin(2\u03c0x)| is decreasing from 3/4 to 1/2, so u = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 is decreasing from 1/4 to 0. Therefore, in this interval, u is between 0 and 1/4, so g(u) = 1/4 - u.\n\nWait, so actually, the interval [0.3648, 5/12] would have u decreasing from 1/4 to 0, so g(u) = 1/4 - u, which is increasing from 0 to 1/4.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my earlier split was incorrect. Let me re-express:\n\nIn the interval [1/12, 5/12], which is from \u22480.0833 to \u22480.4167:\n\n- From x=1/12 to x\u22480.1348: |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 1/2 to 3/4, so u increases from 0 to 1/4. Thus, g(u) = 1/4 - u decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\n- From x\u22480.1348 to x=1/4 (0.25): |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 3/4 to 1, so u increases from 1/4 to 1/2. Thus, g(u) = u - 1/4 increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\n- From x=1/4 to x\u22480.3648: |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 1 to 3/4, so u decreases from 1/2 to 1/4. Thus, g(u) = u - 1/4 decreases from 1/4 to 0.\n\n- From x\u22480.3648 to x=5/12: |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 3/4 to 1/2, so u decreases from 1/4 to 0. Thus, g(u) = 1/4 - u increases from 0 to 1/4.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps I can see that in the interval [1/12, 5/12], the function g(u) first decreases to 0, then increases to 1/4, then decreases back to 0, then increases again to 1/4? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that in the regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, the function g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) is | (|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2) - 1/4 | = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 |.\n\nWait, hold on, since f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2 in this region, so g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) = | (|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 1/2) - 1/4 | = | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 |.\n\nSimilarly, in regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2, f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|) = 1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|, so g(f(|sin(2\u03c0x)|)) = | (1/2 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|) - 1/4 | = | 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| |.\n\nTherefore, simplifying:\n\nA(x) = 4 * [ | |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 | when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2,\n\nand 4 * | 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| | when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2 ]\n\nTherefore, this simplifies the expression a bit.\n\nTherefore, in regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2265 1/2, A(x) = 4| |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 |,\n\nand in regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u2264 1/2, A(x) = 4| 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)| |.\n\nThis might be easier to handle.\n\nSimilarly for B(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))).\n\nLet me analyze B(y):\n\nLet me denote c = cos(3\u03c0y). Then f(c) = | |c| - 1/2 |, and then g(f(c)) = | f(c) - 1/4 |, so B(y) = 4 * | | |c| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.\n\nSimilarly, breaking it down:\n\nFirst, |c| = |cos(3\u03c0y)|, which ranges between 0 and 1.\n\nThen f(|c|) = | |c| - 1/2 |, so similar to before.\n\nThen g(f(|c|)) = | f(|c|) - 1/4 |.\n\nTherefore, similar to A(x), we can split based on |c|:\n\nIf |c| \u2265 1/2, then f(|c|) = |c| - 1/2, so g(f(|c|)) = | |c| - 1/2 - 1/4 | = | |c| - 3/4 |,\n\nand if |c| \u2264 1/2, then f(|c|) = 1/2 - |c|, so g(f(|c|)) = | 1/2 - |c| - 1/4 | = | 1/4 - |c| |.\n\nTherefore, B(y) = 4 * [ | |cos(3\u03c0y)| - 3/4 | when |cos(3\u03c0y)| \u2265 1/2,\n\nand 4 * | 1/4 - |cos(3\u03c0y)| | when |cos(3\u03c0y)| \u2264 1/2 ]\n\nTherefore, both A(x) and B(y) have similar structures, just with different trigonometric functions inside.\n\nNow, to find the intersections, we need to consider the equations y = A(x) and x = B(y). Since both A and B are functions from [0,1] to [0,1], we can consider their graphs and see where they intersect.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric in a way (if we swap x and y, the equations swap), but since A and B are not the same functions (due to different trigonometric arguments), the intersections might not be symmetric. However, perhaps the number of intersections can be found by analyzing the number of times the two graphs cross each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the functions A(x) and B(y) as piecewise functions and find their intersections by considering different intervals.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe it's better to first sketch or analyze the behavior of A(x) and B(y) over their intervals.\n\nStarting with A(x):\n\nAs established earlier, A(x) is defined piecewise based on |sin(2\u03c0x)|.\n\nLet me consider the interval [0,1] divided into the regions where |sin(2\u03c0x)| is above or below 1/2, and further split where needed.\n\nFirst, let's note the critical points where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 1/2 and |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4, which we found earlier at x = 1/12, 5/12, 7/12, 11/12, and approximately 0.1348, 0.3648, 0.6352, 0.8652 (the latter two being symmetric counterparts in the second half of the interval).\n\nWait, actually, in the second half (from 0.5 to 1), similar points would occur. Let me confirm:\n\nFor the interval [7/12, 11/12], which is the mirror of [1/12, 5/12], the points where |sin(2\u03c0x)| = 3/4 would be symmetric. Since sin(2\u03c0x) is negative there, but we take absolute value, so the same x positions as in the first half but mirrored around 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the critical points for A(x) are at x = 1/12, ~0.1348, 5/12, 7/12, ~0.8652, 11/12, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the function A(x) will have different expressions in each of these intervals, leading to a piecewise linear or V-shaped graph.\n\nSimilarly for B(y), which is based on cos(3\u03c0y). Let's analyze B(y):\n\nThe function B(y) = 4g(f(cos(3\u03c0y))) is similar but with cos(3\u03c0y). Let's analyze its critical points.\n\nFirst, cos(3\u03c0y) has period 2/3, so over y \u2208 [0,1], it completes 1.5 periods.\n\nLet me consider the behavior of cos(3\u03c0y):\n\n- At y = 0: cos(0) = 1.\n\n- At y = 1/6: cos(3\u03c0*(1/6)) = cos(\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 1/3: cos(\u03c0) = -1.\n\n- At y = 1/2: cos(3\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 2/3: cos(2\u03c0) = 1.\n\n- At y = 5/6: cos(5\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 1: cos(3\u03c0) = -1.\n\nWait, actually, let me compute step by step:\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) for y from 0 to 1:\n\n- At y = 0: cos(0) = 1.\n\n- At y = 1/6: 3\u03c0*(1/6) = \u03c0/2 \u21d2 cos(\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 1/3: 3\u03c0*(1/3) = \u03c0 \u21d2 cos(\u03c0) = -1.\n\n- At y = 1/2: 3\u03c0*(1/2) = 3\u03c0/2 \u21d2 cos(3\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 2/3: 3\u03c0*(2/3) = 2\u03c0 \u21d2 cos(2\u03c0) = 1.\n\n- At y = 5/6: 3\u03c0*(5/6) = 5\u03c0/2 \u21d2 cos(5\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\n- At y = 1: 3\u03c0*1 = 3\u03c0 \u21d2 cos(3\u03c0) = -1.\n\nTherefore, the graph of cos(3\u03c0y) over [0,1] is a cosine wave that starts at 1, goes down to -1 at 1/3, back to 1 at 2/3, and down to -1 at 1. So it has a period of 2/3, so over [0, 2/3], it completes a full period from 1 to -1 and back to 1, then from 2/3 to 1, it goes from 1 to -1 again.\n\nTherefore, |cos(3\u03c0y)| is the absolute value of this, so it will have peaks at 0, 2/3, and 1 (value 1), and valleys at 1/3 and 5/6 (value 1). Wait, actually, at y=1/3, cos(3\u03c0y) is -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| is 1. Wait, actually, the absolute value will make all the negative parts positive. So the graph of |cos(3\u03c0y)| over [0,1] will be:\n\n- From y=0 to 1/3: cos(3\u03c0y) decreases from 1 to -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| decreases to 0 at y=1/6, then increases back to 1 at y=1/3.\n\nWait, no, let me track it properly:\n\nWait, cos(3\u03c0y) from y=0 to y=1/3:\n\nAt y=0: 1\n\nAt y=1/6: 0\n\nAt y=1/3: -1 \u21d2 |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1\n\nWait, so actually, the absolute value would make it:\n\nFrom y=0 to y=1/6: cos(3\u03c0y) decreases from 1 to 0, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| same.\n\nFrom y=1/6 to y=1/3: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from 0 to -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| increases from 0 to 1.\n\nSimilarly, from y=1/3 to y=1/2: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from -1 to 0, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| decreases from 1 to 0.\n\nFrom y=1/2 to y=2/3: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from 0 to 1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| increases to 1.\n\nFrom y=2/3 to y=5/6: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from 1 to 0, then to -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| decreases to 0 at y=5/6, then increases back to 1 at y=2/3? Wait, no:\n\nWait, at y=2/3, cos(3\u03c0*(2/3)) = cos(2\u03c0) = 1.\n\nAt y=5/6: cos(3\u03c0*(5/6)) = cos(5\u03c0/2) = 0.\n\nAt y=1: cos(3\u03c0) = -1 \u21d2 |cos(3\u03c0)| = 1.\n\nTherefore, from y=2/3 to y=5/6: cos(3\u03c0y) decreases from 1 to 0, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| same.\n\nFrom y=5/6 to y=1: cos(3\u03c0y) goes from 0 to -1, so |cos(3\u03c0y)| increases from 0 to 1.\n\nTherefore, the graph of |cos(3\u03c0y)| over [0,1] consists of \"humps\" peaking at y=0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1, with valleys at y=1/6, 1/2, 5/6.\n\nTherefore, the critical points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 and 3/4 will determine the regions for B(y).\n\nFirst, let's find where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 and 3/4.\n\nStarting with |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2:\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) = \u00b11/2 \u21d2 3\u03c0y = \u00b1\u03c0/3 + 2\u03c0k or \u00b12\u03c0/3 + 2\u03c0k.\n\nSolving for y:\n\nFor cos(\u03b8) = 1/2: \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 or 5\u03c0/3.\n\nThus, 3\u03c0y = \u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 1/9 \u22480.1111,\n\nor 3\u03c0y = 5\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 5/9 \u22480.5556,\n\nSimilarly, cos(\u03b8) = -1/2 \u21d2 \u03b8 = 2\u03c0/3 or 4\u03c0/3,\n\nso 3\u03c0y = 2\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 2/9 \u22480.2222,\n\nor 3\u03c0y = 4\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 4/9 \u22480.4444,\n\nand also adding 2\u03c0 to the angles would go beyond the interval [0, 3\u03c0].\n\nTherefore, the solutions in [0,1] are y = 1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, and also considering the periodicity beyond?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nWait, for \u03b8 = 3\u03c0y, over y \u2208 [0,1], \u03b8 ranges from 0 to 3\u03c0.\n\nSo solving cos(\u03b8) = \u00b11/2 within \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 3\u03c0].\n\nThe solutions are:\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 1/2:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3, 7\u03c0/3 (but 7\u03c0/3 \u22487.33 is beyond 3\u03c0\u22489.42, so no),\n\nWait, 5\u03c0/3 is \u22485.23, which is less than 3\u03c0\u22489.42,\n\nWait, actually, 3\u03c0 is about 9.4248, so 7\u03c0/3 \u22487.33 is still within.\n\nWait, cos(7\u03c0/3)=cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2,\n\nSimilarly, cos(11\u03c0/3)=cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2, but 11\u03c0/3\u224811.52>3\u03c0\u22489.42, so no.\n\nWait, actually, cos(\u03b8)=1/2 at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3, 7\u03c0/3, 11\u03c0/3,... but within [0,3\u03c0], the solutions are \u03c0/3, 5\u03c0/3, 7\u03c0/3.\n\nWait, 7\u03c0/3 is 2\u03c0 + \u03c0/3, so cos(7\u03c0/3)=cos(\u03c0/3)=1/2.\n\nSimilarly, cos(\u03b8)= -1/2 at \u03b8=2\u03c0/3, 4\u03c0/3, 8\u03c0/3, 10\u03c0/3,...\n\nWithin [0,3\u03c0], these are 2\u03c0/3, 4\u03c0/3, 8\u03c0/3 (\u22488.377), 10\u03c0/3 (\u224810.472) which is beyond 3\u03c0\u22489.4248, so only up to 8\u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for cos\u03b8 = -1/2 in [0,3\u03c0] are 2\u03c0/3, 4\u03c0/3, 8\u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, converting back to y:\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 1/2:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = (\u03c0/3)/(3\u03c0) = 1/9 \u22480.1111,\n\n\u03b8 = 5\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = (5\u03c0/3)/(3\u03c0) = 5/9 \u22480.5556,\n\n\u03b8 = 7\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = (7\u03c0/3)/(3\u03c0) = 7/9 \u22480.7778.\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = -1/2:\n\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 2/9 \u22480.2222,\n\n\u03b8 = 4\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 4/9 \u22480.4444,\n\n\u03b8 = 8\u03c0/3 \u21d2 y = 8/9 \u22480.8889.\n\nTherefore, the points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 1/2 are at y = 1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, 7/9, 8/9.\n\nSimilarly, solving |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 3/4:\n\ncos(3\u03c0y) = \u00b13/4.\n\nLet me compute the solutions:\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 3/4:\n\n\u03b8 = arccos(3/4) \u22480.7227 radians,\n\nand \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22485.5605 radians,\n\nSimilarly, cos\u03b8 = -3/4 \u21d2 \u03b8 = \u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22482.4189,\n\nand \u03b8 = \u03c0 + arccos(3/4) \u22483.8593.\n\nWithin \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 3\u03c0], we can have multiple solutions.\n\nLet me compute all solutions for cos\u03b8 = 3/4 and cos\u03b8 = -3/4 in [0, 3\u03c0].\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 3/4:\n\n\u03b8\u2081 = arccos(3/4) \u22480.7227,\n\n\u03b8\u2082 = 2\u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22485.5605,\n\n\u03b8\u2083 = 2\u03c0 + arccos(3/4) \u22486.9939,\n\n\u03b8\u2084 = 4\u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u224811.5605 (which is beyond 3\u03c0\u22489.4248, so no).\n\nSo within [0, 3\u03c0], solutions are \u03b8\u2081\u22480.7227, \u03b8\u2082\u22485.5605, \u03b8\u2083\u22486.9939.\n\nSimilarly for cos\u03b8 = -3/4:\n\n\u03b8\u2081 = \u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22482.4189,\n\n\u03b8\u2082 = \u03c0 + arccos(3/4) \u22483.8593,\n\n\u03b8\u2083 = 3\u03c0 - arccos(3/4) \u22488.7617,\n\n\u03b8\u2084 = 3\u03c0 + arccos(3/4) (exceeds 3\u03c0).\n\nThus, within [0, 3\u03c0], solutions are \u03b8\u2081\u22482.4189, \u03b8\u2082\u22483.8593, \u03b8\u2083\u22488.7617.\n\nTherefore, converting to y:\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = 3/4:\n\ny\u2081 = \u03b8\u2081/(3\u03c0) \u22480.7227/(3\u03c0) \u22480.0769,\n\ny\u2082 = \u03b8\u2082/(3\u03c0) \u22485.5605/(3\u03c0) \u22480.586,\n\ny\u2083 = \u03b8\u2083/(3\u03c0) \u22486.9939/(3\u03c0) \u22480.738.\n\nFor cos\u03b8 = -3/4:\n\ny\u2081 = \u03b8\u2081/(3\u03c0) \u22482.4189/(3\u03c0) \u22480.257,\n\ny\u2082 = \u03b8\u2082/(3\u03c0) \u22483.8593/(3\u03c0) \u22480.409,\n\ny\u2083 = \u03b8\u2083/(3\u03c0) \u22488.7617/(3\u03c0) \u22480.923.\n\nTherefore, the points where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 3/4 are approximately at y \u22480.0769, 0.257, 0.409, 0.586, 0.738, 0.923.\n\nTherefore, these points divide the interval [0,1] into regions where |cos(3\u03c0y)| is above or below 1/2 and 3/4.\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Maybe instead of tracking all these points, I can consider that both A(x) and B(y) are piecewise linear functions with multiple segments, and their intersections can be counted by analyzing each segment's possible intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the number of intersections by analyzing the number of times the two functions cross each other in their respective periods.\n\nGiven that A(x) has a period of 1 and B(y) has a period of 2/3, the combined system might have a period of 2 (the least common multiple of 1 and 2/3). However, since we are confined to the unit square [0,1]x[0,1], we can analyze within this square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that both A(x) and B(y) are functions that oscillate between 0 and 1 with certain frequencies, and their intersections can be counted by considering the number of times their graphs cross.\n\nAlternatively, since both functions are composed of absolute values and trigonometric functions, they might have multiple peaks and valleys, leading to multiple intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the number of solutions by analyzing the equations numerically in each interval.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe I can consider the number of intersections by analyzing the number of times each function crosses the other in their respective domains.\n\nAlternatively, since both functions are from [0,1] to [0,1], and they are both continuous and piecewise linear or V-shaped, perhaps each \"hump\" of A(x) can intersect with several \"humps\" of B(y), leading to multiple intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the equations y = A(x) and x = B(y), and substitute one into the other.\n\nLet me consider substituting y = A(x) into x = B(y):\n\nx = B(A(x)).\n\nTherefore, we can consider the function F(x) = B(A(x)), and find the fixed points where F(x) = x.\n\nSimilarly, since A(x) maps [0,1] to [0,1], and B(y) also maps [0,1] to [0,1], the function F(x) is a composition of two functions from [0,1] to [0,1], so it's also a function from [0,1] to [0,1]. The fixed points of F(x) correspond to the solutions of the system.\n\nThe number of fixed points can be determined by analyzing how many times the graph of F(x) crosses the line y = x.\n\nTo find the number of fixed points, we can analyze the behavior of F(x) over [0,1].\n\nHowever, since F(x) = B(A(x)), and both A and B are piecewise functions, this might require breaking down the interval [0,1] into subintervals where A(x) and B(y) are linear, then computing F(x) on each subinterval and checking intersections with y=x.\n\nThis seems tedious but feasible.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the structure of A(x):\n\nAs established earlier, A(x) is built from |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which has critical points at x = 1/12, ~0.1348, 5/12, 7/12, ~0.8652, 11/12, etc.\n\nSimilarly, B(y) is built from |cos(3\u03c0y)|, with critical points at y = 1/9, 2/9, 4/9, 5/9, 7/9, 8/9, and others where |cos(3\u03c0y)| = 3/4.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps it's better to consider the number of intersections by considering the number of times each function's graph crosses the other.\n\nAlternatively, since both functions are composed of multiple linear segments, the total number of intersections can be calculated by counting the intersections between each segment of A(x) and each segment of B(y).\n\nHowever, this requires detailed analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that both A(x) and B(y) are non-negative and bounded between 0 and 1, and each has a certain number of \"peaks\" and \"valleys\".\n\nLet me try to count the number of peaks and valleys for A(x):\n\nLooking at A(x):\n\n- In the interval [0, 1/12], |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u22641/2, so A(x) = 4|1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)||.\n\nSince |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 0 to 1/2 here, the expression inside the absolute value is 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|, which decreases from 1/4 to 0. Therefore, A(x) decreases from 1 to 0 over [0, 1/12].\n\nWait, let me compute at x=0: A(0)=4*|1/4 -0|=1,\n\nAt x=1/12: |sin(2\u03c0*(1/12))|=sin(\u03c0/6)=1/2, so A(1/12)=4*|1/4 -1/2|=4*(1/4)=1.\n\nWait, so actually, at x=1/12, A(x)=1 again.\n\nWait, so between 0 and 1/12, A(x) starts at 1, decreases to 0 at the midpoint?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nWait, in [0,1/12], |sin(2\u03c0x)| goes from 0 to 1/2. The expression inside the absolute value for A(x) is 1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|. Since |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 0 to 1/2, this expression decreases from 1/4 to -1/4. Therefore, the absolute value becomes |1/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)||, which is |1/4 - s| where s goes from 0 to 1/2.\n\nTherefore, when s < 1/4, the expression is 1/4 - s, decreasing from 1/4 to 0,\n\nand when s \u22651/4, it's s - 1/4, increasing from 0 to 1/4.\n\nTherefore, the critical point is at s=1/4, which occurs when |sin(2\u03c0x)|=1/4.\n\nSolving sin(2\u03c0x)=1/4,\n\n2\u03c0x = arcsin(1/4) \u22480.2527 radians,\n\nso x \u22480.2527/(2\u03c0)\u22480.0402.\n\nSimilarly, the negative solution would be in the next interval, but since we're in [0,1/12], which is up to ~0.0833, the critical point at x\u22480.0402 is within [0,1/12].\n\nTherefore, in [0, 0.0402], A(x) decreases from 1 to 0,\n\nthen in [0.0402, 1/12], A(x) increases back to 1.\n\nWait, that's a V-shape in this interval.\n\nWait, let me compute at x=0.0402:\n\nA(x)=4*(1/4 - 1/4)=0,\n\nthen as x increases past 0.0402, |sin(2\u03c0x)| exceeds 1/4, so A(x)=4*(|sin(2\u03c0x)| -1/4), which increases to 4*(1/2 -1/4)=1 at x=1/12.\n\nTherefore, in [0,1/12], A(x) forms a \"V\" shape going down to 0 at x\u22480.0402 and back up to 1 at x=1/12.\n\nSimilarly, in the next interval [1/12, 5/12], where |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u22651/2,\n\nA(x)=4| |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4 |.\n\nHere, |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 1/2 to 1 (at x=1/4), then decreases back to 1/2 at x=5/12.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the absolute value is |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4.\n\nWhen |sin(2\u03c0x)| < 3/4, this is negative, so absolute value makes it 3/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|,\n\nand when |sin(2\u03c0x)| \u22653/4, it's |sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4.\n\nThe critical point is when |sin(2\u03c0x)|=3/4, which occurs at x\u22480.1348 and x\u22480.3648 as before.\n\nTherefore, in [1/12\u22480.0833, 0.1348], |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 1/2 to 3/4,\n\nso A(x)=4*(3/4 - |sin(2\u03c0x)|), decreasing from 4*(3/4 -1/2)=4*(1/4)=1 down to 0 at x\u22480.1348.\n\nThen from x\u22480.1348 to x=1/4 (0.25), |sin(2\u03c0x)| increases from 3/4 to 1,\n\nso A(x)=4*(|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4), increasing from 0 to 4*(1 - 3/4)=1.\n\nThen from x=1/4 to x\u22480.3648, |sin(2\u03c0x)| decreases from 1 to 3/4,\n\nso A(x)=4*(|sin(2\u03c0x)| - 3/4), decreasing back to 0.\n\nThen from x\u22480.3648 to ",
