        "question": "The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices. The matrix corresponding to operator P has the elements in first row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0), elements in the second row as (1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}) and that in third row as (0, 1/ \\sqrt{2}, 0). The matrix operator for Q is represented by the square matrix having elements in the first row as (1, 0, 0), second row as (0, 0, 0) and third row as (0, 0, -1). Now, if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?\nA. 1/6\nB. 1/2\nC. 2/3\nD. 1/3",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q when measuring them one after the other. Let me start by recalling how measurements work in quantum mechanics. When you measure an observable, the system collapses into one of the eigenstates of that observable's operator, right? The probability of collapsing into a particular eigenstate is the square of the amplitude of the state vector projected onto that eigenstate.\n\nFirst, let me handle the measurement of P. The operator P is given by the matrix:\n\nP = [ [0, 1/\u221a2, 0],\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2],\n       [0, 1/\u221a2, 0] ]\n\nI need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P to figure out the possible outcomes and their corresponding states. The problem mentions getting 0 for P, so 0 must be one of the eigenvalues. Let me verify that.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nCalculating the determinant for matrix P - \u03bbI:\n\n| -\u03bb        1/\u221a2       0      |\n| 1/\u221a2     -\u03bb        1/\u221a2    |\n| 0        1/\u221a2      -\u03bb      |\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 [ ... ]\n\nSimplifying term by term:\n\nFirst term: -\u03bb [ \u03bb\u00b2 - (1/2) ]\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2) [ (-\u03bb/\u221a2) - 0 ] = - (1/\u221a2)( -\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/2\n\nThird term: 0\n\nSo determinant = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, determinant calculation:\n\nFirst term expansion: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2)\n\nSecond term: -1/\u221a2*( -\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (\u03bb)/2\n\nThird term: 0\n\nSo determinant = -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + \u03bb/2? Wait, no. Wait, expanding the determinant:\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n-\u03bb * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) * [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]\n\nSo first term: -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2)\n\nSecond term: - (1/\u221a2)*( -\u03bb/\u221a2 ) = (1/\u221a2)*(\u03bb/\u221a2) = \u03bb/(2)\n\nThird term: 0\n\nSo total determinant: -\u03bb\u00b3 + (\u03bb/2) + \u03bb/(2) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, first term is -\u03bb*(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2\n\nSecond term is +\u03bb/2\n\nSo total determinant: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb/2 + \u03bb/2 = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb\n\nSo determinant is -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nSet equal to zero: -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0 => \u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0 => \u03bb=0 or -\u03bb\u00b2 +1=0 => \u03bb\u00b2=1 => \u03bb=1 or \u03bb=-1\n\nSo eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, 1, -1\n\nOkay, so 0 is indeed an eigenvalue. Good. So when we measure P, possible outcomes are -1, 0, 1. The question is about getting 0 for P, so we need the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0.\n\nLet me find the eigenvector for \u03bb=0.\n\nWe need to solve (P - 0I)v = 0 => Pv = 0\n\nSo the equations are:\n\n(0)v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + (0)v3 = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2)v1 + (0)v2 + (1/\u221a2)v3 = 0\n\n(0)v1 + (1/\u221a2)v2 + (0)v3 = 0\n\nSo equations:\n\n1/\u221a2 v2 = 0 => v2 = 0\n\n1/\u221a2 v1 + 1/\u221a2 v3 = 0 => v1 + v3 = 0\n\nAnd the third equation is same as the first: 1/\u221a2 v2 = 0 => v2 =0\n\nSo eigenvectors for \u03bb=0 are vectors with v2=0 and v1 = -v3. So the general eigenvector is (v1, 0, -v1). Let me pick v1=1 for simplicity, so eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1\u00b2 + 0 + (-1)\u00b2) = sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvector is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2). Let me check:\n\nP multiplied by this vector:\n\nFirst component: 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1/\u221a2) = 0\n\nSecond component: (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) + 0*0 + (1/\u221a2)*(-1/\u221a2) = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0\n\nThird component: 0*(1/\u221a2) + (1/\u221a2)*0 + 0*(-1/\u221a2) = 0\n\nSo yes, it's an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0. So the eigenstate for eigenvalue 0 is |p0> = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T\n\nNow, the initial state of the system is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but we need to make sure it's normalized. Let me check the norm.\n\nThe norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the normalized state is (1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1)^T. But wait, the problem says \"the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\". So maybe it's already normalized? Wait, no, because the norm squared is 6, so unless specified otherwise, states are usually considered normalized. But here, the problem says \"the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)\", so perhaps it's not normalized. Hmm. Wait, in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, but sometimes problems give unnormalized vectors and you have to normalize them. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"The state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1), and the operators of two observables P and Q of the system are represented by two square matrices.\"\n\nIt doesn't mention normalization, so probably we need to normalize the state first. So the initial state vector is |\u03c8> = (-1, 2, 1)^T, with norm sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state is |\u03c8> = (1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nBut when calculating probabilities, we can either normalize the state first or account for the norm in the probability. Let me confirm: the probability of collapsing into an eigenstate |a> is |<a|\u03c8>|\u00b2 divided by the norm squared of |\u03c8> if |\u03c8> isn't normalized. But since the problem just gives the state as a column matrix, maybe it's already considered as a vector in the Hilbert space, not necessarily normalized. Wait, but in standard quantum mechanics, the state vectors are required to be normalized. So perhaps the given vector is the actual state vector, and it's not normalized. Wait, but (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6, so the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual normalized state is 1/sqrt(6) times the given vector.\n\nBut maybe the problem is considering the given vector as already normalized? Wait, no, because sqrt(6) isn't 1. So probably, we need to normalize it. Therefore, the initial state is |\u03c8> = (1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1)^T.\n\nSo first, we measure P. The probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the projection of |\u03c8> onto |p0>.\n\nSo compute <p0|\u03c8>.\n\nFirst, |p0> is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T. So conjugate transpose is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2).\n\nThe inner product with |\u03c8> = (1/\u221a6)(-1, 2, 1)^T is:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) = (-1)/(\u221a12) + 0 + (-1)/(\u221a12) = (-2)/(\u221a12) = (-2)/(2\u221a3) = (-1)/\u221a3\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a3)^2 = 1/3. So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, |p0> is already a normalized eigenvector, right? Because (1/\u221a2)^2 + 0 + (-1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2 +1/2=1. So yes, |p0> is normalized. And |\u03c8> is given as (-1,2,1), which we normalized to 1/sqrt(6). So the inner product is indeed (-1)/sqrt(12) -1/sqrt(12) = -2/sqrt(12) = -1/sqrt(3), and the square is 1/3. So probability 1/3.\n\nAfter measuring P=0, the state collapses to |p0>, which is (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T.\n\nNow, we need to measure Q immediately after. The operator Q is given by:\n\nQ = [ [1, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, -1] ]\n\nThis is a diagonal matrix, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1 with corresponding eigenvectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). Wait, but the second row and column have 0, so eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the eigenvector (0,1,0). So the eigenstates are standard basis vectors.\n\nWe need the probability of getting -1 for Q. The eigenstate corresponding to Q=-1 is (0,0,1)^T.\n\nSo after the collapse to |p0> = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T, we need to compute the probability of collapsing to (0,0,1)^T when measuring Q.\n\nThe probability is the square of the amplitude of the projection of |p0> onto |q_{-1}> = (0,0,1)^T.\n\nCompute <q_{-1}|p0> = (0,0,1) * (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)^T = -1/\u221a2.\n\nThe absolute value squared is (1/\u221a2)^2 = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 after having measured P=0 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the product of the probability of first measuring P=0 (1/3) and then measuring Q=-1 given that the first measurement occurred (1/2). Wait, no. Wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure P and then Q, the total probability is the probability of collapsing to the P eigenstate, then collapsing to the Q eigenstate. So it's the probability of the first measurement multiplied by the conditional probability of the second given the first.\n\nBut actually, since after measuring P=0, the state is |p0>, then the probability of Q=-1 is |<q_{-1}|p0>|\u00b2, which is 1/2. Therefore, the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Wait, the initial probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3, and then given that, the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2. So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So answer A. 1/6.\n\nBut let me check again.\n\nWait, initial state |\u03c8> normalized is (1/\u221a6)(-1,2,1). Projection onto |p0> is <p0|\u03c8> = (-1)/\u221a3, so squared magnitude 1/3. Then, after collapse to |p0>, the state is |p0>, and projecting onto |q_{-1}> is <q_{-1}|p0> = -1/\u221a2, squared magnitude 1/2. So total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So answer A.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have degenerate eigenvalues, you have to consider more, but in this case, eigenvalue 0 for P is non-degenerate? Let me check the eigenvectors for P=0. Earlier, we found that the eigenvector is (1,0,-1) direction, which is one-dimensional. So non-degenerate. So yes, the collapse is to that specific eigenvector.\n\nSimilarly, Q=-1 is non-degenerate, eigenvector (0,0,1). So yes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify the projection steps again.\n\nFirst, initial state: (-1,2,1), norm sqrt(6), normalized to 1/sqrt(6)*(-1,2,1).\n\nEigenstate |p0> is 1/sqrt(2)*(1,0,-1).\n\nInner product:\n\n(1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) =\n\n(-1)/(sqrt(12)) + (-1)/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) = -1/sqrt(3)\n\nSquared magnitude: 1/3. Correct.\n\nThen, |p0> is 1/sqrt(2)*(1,0,-1). Projection onto |q_{-1}> = (0,0,1):\n\nInner product is (0)*1/sqrt(2) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) = -1/sqrt(2). Squared magnitude: 1/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, total probability 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So answer A.\n\nBut wait, the options given are A. 1/6, B. 1/2, C. 2/3, D. 1/3.\n\nSo according to this, the answer should be A. 1/6.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the state after measurement of P=0 is |p0> or if it's the normalized projection. Wait, when you measure P=0, the state collapses to the eigenstate |p0>, regardless of the initial state. The probability is |<p0|\u03c8>|\u00b2, and the new state is |p0>. So yes, then measuring Q on |p0> gives |<q_{-1}|p0>|\u00b2 = 1/2. So total probability 1/3 *1/2=1/6. So answer A.\n\nBut let me check again for any miscalculations.\n\nFirst, P matrix:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nRow 2: 1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2\n\nRow 3: 0, 1/\u221a2, 0\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nEigenvalue 0 eigenvector: solved earlier, correct.\n\nInitial state: (-1,2,1). Norm squared 6, so normalized to 1/sqrt(6)(-1,2,1). Correct.\n\nProjection onto |p0>:\n\n(1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)) dotted with ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )\n\n= ( -1/sqrt(12) + 0 -1/sqrt(12) ) = -2/sqrt(12) = -1/sqrt(3). Squared 1/3. Correct.\n\nThen |p0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)). Projection onto Q=-1 eigenstate (0,0,1):\n\nComponent is -1/sqrt(2). Squared 1/2. Correct.\n\nThus, the combined probability is 1/3 *1/2=1/6. Answer A.\n\nBut wait, the answer isn't one of the more common fractions, but 1/6 is an option. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if perhaps the state doesn't need to be normalized. Suppose the problem assumes that the state vector is not normalized, and computes probabilities without normalizing. But in that case, the probability would be |<p0|\u03c8>|\u00b2 / |<\u03c8|\u03c8>| * |<q|p0>|\u00b2. But that would be the same as normalizing the state first. So either way, the result is the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the eigenvector for P=0. Let me check again.\n\nWhen solving Pv =0:\n\nFirst equation: (1/\u221a2)v2 =0 => v2=0\n\nSecond equation: (1/\u221a2)v1 + (1/\u221a2)v3=0 => v1 +v3=0 => v1=-v3\n\nThird equation: same as first, v2=0\n\nSo eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). Normalizing, a=1/sqrt(2). So eigenvector (1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)). Correct.\n\nYes, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the order of measurements: measure P then Q, but perhaps there's some combined probability? But no, in quantum mechanics, subsequent measurements are calculated as projection onto the first eigenstate, then projection onto the second. So the total probability is the product.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. 1/6.\n\nBut wait, let me check the answer options again. The problem says \"the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements\". So yes, measure P first, get 0, then measure Q, get -1. The combined probability is indeed 1/3 *1/2=1/6. So answer A.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, maybe I messed up the order of the eigenvectors? Let me check Q's matrix again.\n\nQ is given as:\n\nFirst row: 1,0,0\n\nSecond row:0,0,0\n\nThird row:0,0,-1\n\nSo yes, eigenvalues 1,0,-1 with eigenvectors (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Wait, but eigenvalue -1 corresponds to (0,0,1), right? Because Q*(0,0,1) = (0,0,-1). So yes, eigenvector (0,0,1) with eigenvalue -1.\n\nTherefore, projecting |p0>=(1/sqrt(2),0,-1/sqrt(2)) onto (0,0,1) gives -1/sqrt(2), squared is 1/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. 1/6.\n\nBut wait, the options given include 1/3, which is the probability of getting 0 for P. Maybe the question is trying to trick us into just giving the probability of P=0, but no, it specifically asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So it's sequential measurements, so multiplication of both probabilities. So 1/3 *1/2=1/6. So answer A.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}"
