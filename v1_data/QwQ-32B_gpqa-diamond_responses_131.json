        "question": "The 1H NMR spectrum of a solution containing a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14 exhibits two signals (two singlets) at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Which two compounds are present in the mixture from the following options: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\nA. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\nB. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nC. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nD. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene",
        "response": "Okay, so I have this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which two compounds are present in a 1:1 mixture based on their NMR spectra. The molecular formula for both is C10H14, which is important because that tells me they're both tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene. Let me start by recalling what each of these compounds looks like structurally.\n\nFirst, the molecular formula C10H14. Let me confirm that. For a tetramethylbenzene, benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups (each CH3) would be C6 + 4*CH3 = C6 + C4H12 = C10H12. Wait, but the formula here is C10H14. Hmm, so maybe one of them is a diethylbenzene? Because ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyl groups would add C4H10 to benzene (C6H6), giving C10H16. Wait, that's even more. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, benzene is C6H6. Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) would be 4*(CH3) = C4H12. So total would be C6+4=10, H6 + 12 = 18? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, actually, when you add a methyl group to benzene, each methyl group is -CH3, so each adds a CH2? Wait no, each methyl is -CH3, so each methyl adds 3 H's. Wait, benzene has 6 H's. Adding four methyl groups would replace four H's with four CH3 groups. So total H's would be 6 - 4 + 4*(3) = 6 -4 +12 = 14. Oh! So C10H14. So actually, tetramethylbenzene would have the formula C10H14. Wait, so that's correct. So all the tetramethylbenzenes here have the formula C10H14. The diethylbenzene would be C8H10 (benzene) plus two ethyl groups (each C2H5), so total C8 + 4 = C12? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Adding two ethyl groups (each C2H5) would give C6 + 2*2 = C10, and H6 + 2*(5) = H16. Wait, so C10H16? But the problem states the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, so maybe the diethylbenzene is not part of the mixture? Wait, but the options include 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is -CH3, so adding four methyl groups: each methyl adds a carbon and three hydrogens, but replaces a hydrogen on the benzene. So for each methyl group, the formula becomes C6 + 4*(C) = C10, and H6 - 4*(1) + 4*(3) = H6 -4 +12 = H14. So yes, tetramethylbenzene is C10H14. \n\nNow, diethylbenzene: each ethyl group is -C2H5. So two ethyl groups would add 2*(C2) = C4, so total C6 +4 = C10. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H, each ethyl group has 5 H (since one H is replaced by the benzene), so two ethyl groups contribute 2*(5) = 10 H. So total H is 6 - 2 (since two H's on benzene are replaced) + 10 = 14. Wait, so diethylbenzene would also be C10H14? Because 6 + 4 = 10 carbons, and 6 -2 +10 = 14 hydrogens. Oh! So both tetramethylbenzene and diethylbenzene have the same molecular formula C10H14. That's why they can be in a mixture here. So the options include both tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene. Got it.\n\nNow, the NMR spectrum shows two signals (two singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. And three signals around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Let me think about what that means.\n\nFirst, the aromatic protons. In aromatic compounds, the protons on the benzene ring typically resonate around 6-8 ppm. The fact that there are two singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio suggests that each compound in the mixture has a certain number of aromatic protons, and when mixed 1:1, the signals combine such that each compound contributes a singlet, but since they are in equal amounts, the integrals are 1:1. Wait, but if each compound has different numbers of aromatic protons, then their integrals would add up. Wait, maybe each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, so each gives a singlet, and since they are in 1:1 ratio, the integrals would be equal. So each compound must have the same number of aromatic protons? Because otherwise, their integrals would be different. For example, if one compound has 2 aromatic protons and the other has 4, then in a 1:1 mixture, the integrals would be 2:4, but since they are in 1:1, the total would be 2+4=6, but the ratio would be 2:4. Hmm, but the problem states that the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio. So that suggests that each compound contributes equally to each signal? Wait, maybe each compound has only one aromatic proton, but that can't be because tetramethylbenzenes would have some aromatic protons left. Wait, maybe each compound has two aromatic protons, so when mixed 1:1, each contributes two, so the total is 4, but the ratio between the two signals is 1:1. Wait, perhaps each compound has the same number of aromatic protons, so their signals are separate and each has the same integral. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, so each gives a singlet, and since they are in 1:1 ratio, the integrals of the two singlets are 1:1. That would make sense. So each compound must have the same number of aromatic protons. For example, if one compound has two aromatic protons and the other also has two, then in a 1:1 mixture, each contributes two, so the integrals would be 2:2, which is 1:1. Alternatively, if one has four and the other has four, same thing. Wait, but the problem says two signals, so each compound must have a different number of aromatic protons? Wait, no, if they have the same number, but different chemical shifts, then each would give a singlet, and the integrals would be the same. So that's possible.\n\nNow, moving on to the aliphatic protons. The three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since they are all singlets, that suggests that each of these protons is in an environment where they are not adjacent to any other protons, so they don't have any neighboring hydrogens. The 2.2 ppm region is typical for methyl groups adjacent to a carbon with two methyl groups, like in isopropyl groups, but maybe in this case, they are just methyl groups attached to a carbon that's part of a larger structure. Alternatively, maybe they are methyl groups in a symmetric environment.\n\nWait, the problem states three signals at around 2.2 ppm, each a singlet, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the total number of aliphatic protons would be 2 +1 +1 =4? Wait, but each signal's integral corresponds to the number of protons. Wait, the ratio is 2:1:1, so the total is 4 parts. But the actual number of protons would depend on the scale. But since it's a mixture, the integrals are relative. So each compound contributes to these signals. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound's contribution is doubled? Wait, maybe each compound has different aliphatic protons, so when mixed, the signals combine. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible compounds given:\n\nThe options are:\n\n1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\n2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\n3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n\n4. 1,4-diethylbenzene\n\nWe need to pick two of these that when mixed 1:1 give the described NMR spectrum.\n\nLet me analyze each compound's structure and NMR signals.\n\nStarting with the tetramethylbenzenes:\n\n1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: The methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. Let me draw this mentally. The benzene ring with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. Let's see the symmetry here. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 4 and 5 are adjacent. The remaining positions are 3 and 6. Wait, but with four methyl groups, the positions would be 1,2,4,5. So the remaining two positions (3 and 6) are hydrogen. Wait, but in a tetramethylbenzene, four methyl groups replace four hydrogens. So the remaining two hydrogens are at positions 3 and 6. Are those equivalent? Let's see the symmetry. If the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5, then positions 3 and 6 are opposite each other. Are they equivalent? Let me think. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the 3-6 axis, so those two hydrogens would be equivalent. Therefore, there would be only one set of aromatic protons (the two hydrogens at 3 and 6), so a singlet at around 7 ppm maybe? Wait, but the problem says the aromatic signals are at ~6.7 ppm. Hmm, maybe the exact position depends on substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the aromatic protons are deshielded or shielded based on the substituents. Let me think. The methyl groups are electron-donating, so they would deshield the adjacent protons, but the protons opposite to the methyl groups might be more shielded. Wait, but in this case, the remaining hydrogens are at positions 3 and 6, which are adjacent to methyl groups? Wait, position 3 is adjacent to positions 2 and 4, which have methyl groups. Wait, position 3 is between 2 and 4, which are both methyl. So the H at position 3 is adjacent to two methyl groups. Similarly, position 6 is adjacent to positions 5 and 1. Position 5 has a methyl, position 1 has a methyl. So the H at position 6 is adjacent to two methyl groups as well. Therefore, both H3 and H6 are each adjacent to two methyl groups. Therefore, their chemical shifts would be similar, so they form a singlet. The chemical shift would be around 6.7 ppm? Maybe.\n\nNow, the aliphatic protons: each methyl group is attached to the benzene. Since the methyl groups are in different positions, but in this case, the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. Let's see if any of them are equivalent. The methyl groups at 1 and 5: position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (but 6 has a H?), wait no, position 1 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H). Wait, actually, the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. Let me think of the structure again. Let me number the benzene ring as follows:\n\n1: methyl\n\n2: methyl\n\n3: H\n\n4: methyl\n\n5: methyl\n\n6: H\n\nSo the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. The H's are at 3 and 6. Now, the methyl groups at positions 1 and 5: position 1 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Wait, so the methyl at 1 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, while the methyl at 5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H. Are those equivalent? Let me see the symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the 3-6 axis. So position 1 and position 5 would be mirror images across that plane. Therefore, their methyl groups would be equivalent. Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 4: position 2 is adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (H). Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (H) and 5 (methyl). Wait, so position 2's methyl is adjacent to a methyl and a H, and position 4's methyl is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Hmm, but due to the symmetry, maybe they are equivalent? Let me think again. The molecule is symmetric along the 3-6 axis. So position 2 and position 4 would be mirror images. Therefore, their methyl groups are equivalent. So all four methyl groups are equivalent? Wait, but positions 1 and 5 are equivalent, and positions 2 and 4 are equivalent. Wait, but each pair is equivalent, so there are two types of methyl groups? Let me see:\n\nMethyl at 1: adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 6). \n\nMethyl at 2: adjacent to methyl (position 1) and H (position 3).\n\nWait, but due to the symmetry, the methyl at position 1 and position 5 are equivalent, and the methyl at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Wait, but position 5 is adjacent to position 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). So the methyl at position 5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, similar to position 1. So positions 1 and 5 are equivalent. Similarly, positions 2 and 4 are each adjacent to a methyl and a H, but on the other side. Wait, but maybe they are equivalent as well? Let me think of the molecule. If you rotate it 180 degrees around the axis through 3 and 6, position 1 swaps with 5, and 2 swaps with 4. Therefore, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, there are two types of methyl groups. Each type has two methyl groups. Therefore, the aliphatic protons would have two signals: one for the two methyl groups at positions 1 and 5, and another for the two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Each methyl group has 3 H's, so each signal would have 2*3=6 H's. Wait, but that would mean two signals at different chemical shifts, each with 6 H's. But the problem states three signals at 2.2 ppm. Hmm, so maybe my assumption is wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all four methyl groups are equivalent? Let me think again. If the molecule has more symmetry. Let me consider the actual structure. If the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5, then the molecule is symmetric in such a way that all four methyl groups are equivalent? Wait, no. Let me try to imagine the structure. Let me think of the benzene ring with substituents:\n\nPositions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so that's a meta or ortho? Wait, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), then 4 and 5 are also adjacent (ortho). The positions 1,2,4,5 form a sort of rectangle? Maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the 3-6 axis, but not more. Therefore, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, two distinct methyl groups. Each methyl group would have a different chemical shift. So their signals would be two singlets at different ppm. But the problem says three signals at 2.2 ppm. Hmm, so maybe this compound isn't one of them? Or perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the methyl groups are all equivalent. Wait, if the molecule is symmetric in another way. Let me think of the positions again. If the substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then the molecule is actually 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Wait, perhaps this is actually 1,3,5,2-tetramethyl? Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually symmetric in a way that all four methyl groups are equivalent. Wait, maybe it's a square? Let me think of the benzene ring as a hexagon. Positions 1,2,4,5: if you place methyl groups at 1,2,4,5, then the remaining hydrogens are at 3 and 6. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry through 3-6, but the methyl groups are arranged such that each pair (1-5 and 2-4) are symmetric. Therefore, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, two types of methyl groups. So their chemical shifts would be different. Therefore, two signals for the aliphatic protons. But the problem states three signals. Hmm, so maybe this compound isn't part of the mixture? Let me check the other compounds.\n\nNext, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze this one. The methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,5. Let me see the structure. The remaining hydrogens would be at positions 4 and 6. Let's check symmetry. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). Wait, so the H at position 4 is between two methyls, and H at 6 is between two methyls. Are those equivalent? Let me see the symmetry. The molecule might have a plane of symmetry through positions 4 and 6? Wait, if the methyls are at 1,2,3,5, then the structure is a bit more complex. Let me try to visualize:\n\nPositions 1: methyl\n\n2: methyl\n\n3: methyl\n\n4: H\n\n5: methyl\n\n6: H\n\nSo the H's are at 4 and 6. Position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So both H4 and H6 are each adjacent to two methyl groups. Are they equivalent? Let's see symmetry. If you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the axis through the center, position 1 swaps with 4, 2 swaps with 5, etc. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry through positions 3 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the H's at 4 and 6 are not equivalent. Let me think. The H at position 4 is adjacent to methyl groups at 3 and 5, while the H at 6 is adjacent to methyl groups at 5 and 1. Since the arrangement around the ring is different, maybe they are not equivalent. Therefore, there would be two different aromatic protons? Wait, but maybe they are still equivalent due to some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe they are in the same environment. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the chemical shifts. Both H4 and H6 are each next to two methyl groups, so their chemical shifts might be similar, but perhaps not exactly the same. Alternatively, maybe they are in the same environment. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through positions 3 and 6, making H4 and H6 equivalent? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are not equivalent, leading to two signals for aromatic protons. But the problem states that there are two signals in the aromatic region (6.7 ppm) in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm.\n\nNow, the aliphatic protons for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Let's see their equivalence. The methyl at position 1 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H). The methyl at 2 is adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (methyl). The methyl at 3 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (H). The methyl at 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H). Wait, so each methyl group's environment:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 6).\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to two methyls (positions 1 and 3).\n\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 4).\n\n- Methyl at 5: adjacent to H (positions 4 and 6? Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Position 4 is H, position 6 is H. So methyl at 5 is adjacent to two H's.\n\nWait, so the methyl at position 5 is adjacent to two H's. The methyl at position 1 is adjacent to one methyl and one H. The methyl at position 2 is adjacent to two methyls. The methyl at position 3 is adjacent to one methyl and one H. Therefore, the methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are similar but not the same? Wait, position 1 is adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 6). Position 3 is adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 4). Since positions 4 and 6 are different (position 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and 5, while position 6 is adjacent to methyl at 1 and 5), maybe the environments of the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are different. Therefore, each methyl group is in a unique environment. Therefore, there are four different methyl groups? Wait, but that can't be. Let me see:\n\nWait, the methyl at position 2 is adjacent to two methyls (positions 1 and 3). That's unique.\n\nThe methyl at position 5 is adjacent to two H's (positions 4 and 6). That's another unique environment.\n\nThe methyl at position 1 is adjacent to one methyl and one H (position 6). \n\nThe methyl at position 3 is adjacent to one methyl and one H (position 4). \n\nSo positions 1 and 3 are similar but not the same because their adjacent H's are in different positions. Therefore, each of these methyl groups would have different chemical shifts. So total of four different methyl groups? That would give four signals in the aliphatic region. But the problem states three signals. Hmm, so maybe this compound isn't part of the mixture either?\n\nMoving on to 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze this. The methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,4. The remaining hydrogens are at positions 5 and 6. Let's see symmetry. The H's at 5 and 6: position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (methyl). Wait, so H5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, and H6 is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Are they equivalent? Let me see symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through positions 5 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees might swap them. Let me think. If you rotate the benzene ring 180 degrees, position 1 swaps with 4, 2 swaps with 3, etc. So position 5 would stay in place? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the H's at 5 and 6 are not equivalent. Therefore, two different aromatic protons. But the problem states two signals in the aromatic region. Hmm.\n\nNow, the aliphatic protons for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. The methyl groups are at 1,2,3,4. Let's see their environments:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (H).\n\nSo:\n\n- Methyl at 2 and 3 are each adjacent to two methyls. Wait, position 2 is between 1 and 3 (both methyl), so adjacent to two methyls. Position 3 is between 2 and 4 (both methyl), so also adjacent to two methyls. So methyls at 2 and 3 are equivalent?\n\n- Methyl at 1 is adjacent to one methyl and one H (position 6).\n\n- Methyl at 4 is adjacent to one methyl and one H (position 5).\n\nSo the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are similar but not the same. The methyls at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So total of three types of methyl groups: two at positions 2 and 3 (equivalent), one at 1, and one at 4. Wait, so that would be three signals in the aliphatic region. Each of the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would have their own signals, and the methyls at 2 and 3 would be one signal. So three signals. The integrals would be:\n\n- Methyl at 2 and 3: two methyl groups, each with 3 H's \u2192 6 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 1: 3 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 4: 3 H's.\n\nTotal aliphatic H's: 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. Which matches C10H14: 10 carbons, 14 hydrogens. The aromatic H's are 2 (positions 5 and 6), so total H's: 12 + 2 =14. Correct.\n\nSo the aliphatic region would have three signals: one at ~2.2 ppm (maybe) for the two methyl groups (positions 2 and 3), and two others. Wait, but the problem states three signals at around 2.2 ppm. So maybe all three signals are around 2.2? That might be possible if the chemical shifts are close. Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are all in a similar environment. Wait, but their environments are different. The methyls at 2 and 3 are adjacent to two methyls, so they might be more shielded or deshielded compared to those at 1 and 4. Hmm, but the problem says all three signals are around 2.2 ppm. Let me think. The methyl groups adjacent to two methyls (positions 2 and 3) might have a different chemical shift than those adjacent to one methyl and a H. But maybe they are all in the 2.2 region. Alternatively, maybe the diethylbenzene contributes to some of the signals.\n\nNow, the last compound is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's analyze that. The structure is benzene with ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So the molecule has two ethyl groups. Let's see the structure:\n\nPositions 1 and 4 have ethyl groups. The remaining positions (2,3,5,6) have H's. Let's check symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 1 and 4. Therefore, the ethyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent. The H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. \n\nAromatic protons: positions 2,3,5,6. Since the molecule is symmetric through the 1-4 axis, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent. Therefore, there are two types of aromatic protons. Each pair (2 &6, 3&5) would give two signals. So in the aromatic region, two signals. The chemical shifts would depend on their positions relative to the ethyl groups. The H's at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to an ethyl group (position 1 or 4) and a H. The H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to two H's and one ethyl group? Wait, position 3 is adjacent to 2 (H) and 4 (ethyl). Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (ethyl) and 6 (H). Wait, so H at 3 is adjacent to an ethyl and a H, and H at 5 is adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Wait, so actually, positions 3 and 5 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (H) and 4 (ethyl). Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 (ethyl) and 6 (H). So their environments are similar. Therefore, the H's at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H (position 1 or 4's ethyl). Wait, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (ethyl) and 3 (H). Wait, no, position 2 is adjacent to 1 (ethyl) and 3 (H). So H at position 2 is adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Similarly, H at position 6 is adjacent to position 5 (H) and 7? Wait, benzene only has six positions. Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (ethyl). So H at 6 is adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Therefore, the H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the H's at 3 and 5 are also equivalent. Wait, but actually, positions 3 and 5 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H, similar to positions 2 and 6. Wait, no, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (H) and 4 (ethyl). Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 (ethyl) and 6 (H). So their environments are the same as positions 2 and 6. Wait, actually, maybe all four H's are equivalent? Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the 1-4 axis. So positions 2 and 6 are mirror images, and 3 and 5 are mirror images. Therefore, the H's at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 are equivalent. Therefore, two signals in the aromatic region. \n\nNow, the aliphatic protons in 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl group has two CH2 and one CH3? Wait, no, an ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl group has a CH2 and a CH3. Since the ethyl groups are at positions 1 and 4, which are equivalent, each contributes the same protons. \n\nLooking at the ethyl groups:\n\nEach ethyl group has a CH2 adjacent to the benzene and a CH3. The CH2 protons are adjacent to the benzene and another CH2? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe ethyl group at position 1 is attached to the benzene at C1. The structure is: benzene-C1-CH2-CH3. Similarly for position 4. \n\nThe CH2 group is adjacent to the benzene (which is electron-withdrawing) and the CH3. The CH3 is adjacent to the CH2. \n\nThe protons on the CH2 (the two H's on each CH2) would be in a similar environment, and the CH3's would also be in a similar environment. Since there are two ethyl groups, each contributing a CH2 and a CH3, the total aliphatic protons are:\n\n- For each ethyl group: 2 (CH2) + 3 (CH3) = 5 H's. Two ethyl groups: 10 H's. \n\nBut wait, each CH2 has two H's, so two CH2 groups (from each ethyl) would have 2*2=4 H's, and two CH3 groups would have 2*3=6 H's. Total 10 H's. \n\nNow, the chemical shifts:\n\nThe CH2 protons adjacent to the benzene would be deshielded compared to the CH3. The CH2 protons might be around 2.5 ppm, and the CH3 around 1 ppm? Wait, but the problem mentions signals around 2.2 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is around 2.2 ppm and the CH3 is lower. Let me think. The CH2 next to the benzene (which is electron-withdrawing) might have a chemical shift around 2.2 ppm, while the CH3 further away might be around 1.2 ppm. But the problem states that all three signals are around 2.2 ppm. Hmm, so maybe the CH3 is also around 2.2? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the diethylbenzene's aliphatic protons are all in the 2.2 region. Wait, perhaps the CH2 and CH3 are overlapping? Or maybe the diethyl groups are arranged such that their protons are in a symmetric environment. Wait, each ethyl group's CH2 and CH3 are in the same environment as the other ethyl group's. Therefore, the CH2's would be a singlet, and the CH3's would be another singlet. So two signals from the aliphatic region. But the problem states three signals. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CH2 protons are split into two signals due to some coupling? But the problem says all are singlets. So maybe the CH2 and CH3 are in different environments but still in the 2.2 region? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the diethylbenzene contributes two signals in the aliphatic region, and another compound contributes the third. Let me think.\n\nNow, going back to the problem. The mixture has two compounds in 1:1 ratio. The NMR shows two signals in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) in a 1:1 ratio, and three signals in the aliphatic region (around 2.2 ppm) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nOption A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nOption B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nOption C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nWe need to pick the pair that when mixed 1:1 gives the described NMR.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\nOption A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, the aromatic region:\n\nFor 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: as analyzed earlier, the aromatic H's are at positions 4 and 6. Wait, no, earlier I thought the remaining H's were at 4 and 6? Wait, let me recheck. The methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6 have H's. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So both H's are adjacent to two methyls. Are they equivalent? Let me see symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 4 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees swaps positions 1\u21944 and 2\u21945, etc. Hmm, maybe the H's at 4 and 6 are not equivalent. Therefore, two signals in the aromatic region. \n\nThe 1,4-diethylbenzene has two aromatic signals (as analyzed earlier). \n\nSo when mixed, the total aromatic signals would be 2 (from tetramethyl) + 2 (from diethyl) = 4 signals? But the problem states two signals. Therefore, this can't be correct. Unless the two compounds have overlapping aromatic signals. \n\nWait, maybe the aromatic protons of both compounds are at the same chemical shift? For example, if both compounds have their aromatic H's at ~6.7 ppm, then mixing them would still give two signals (each from one compound) but in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but each compound has two aromatic signals? Then mixing would give four signals. Hmm, so this might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe one of the compounds has only one aromatic signal. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: the H's at 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me think of the structure again. The molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. The H's are at 4 and 6. Position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). The environment of H4 and H6 are similar: each is between two methyl groups. Therefore, they are equivalent. So only one aromatic signal from this compound. \n\nWait, that's different from my previous thought. If they are equivalent, then only one signal. Let me confirm symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 4 and 6, then yes, H4 and H6 would be equivalent. Wait, but the methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Let me imagine the benzene ring:\n\nPositions 1: methyl\n\n2: methyl\n\n3: methyl\n\n4: H\n\n5: methyl\n\n6: H\n\nIf you draw this, positions 1,2,3,5 have methyls. The H's are at 4 and 6. The molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the line connecting the midpoints between positions 1-6 and 3-4? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the ring through the center might swap positions 1\u21944, 2\u21945, 3\u21946. Wait, that would swap H4 with H1 (but H1 is a methyl). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric enough for H4 and H6 to be equivalent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are not equivalent. Let me think of the substituents. The H at position 4 is adjacent to two methyl groups (positions 3 and 5), while the H at position 6 is adjacent to methyl groups at positions 1 and 5. Since the substituents around each H are different (position 4 has methyls at 3 and 5, position 6 has methyls at 1 and 5), their chemical environments are different. Therefore, they would have different chemical shifts. So two signals from the tetramethyl compound. \n\nThe diethylbenzene has two aromatic signals. So total of four signals in the aromatic region when mixed, which contradicts the problem's two signals. So Option A is out.\n\nOption B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, aromatic region:\n\n1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: as analyzed earlier, the aromatic H's are at positions 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me check again. The molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. The H's are at 3 and 6. Position 3 is between 2 (methyl) and 4 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So each H is between two methyls. Are they equivalent? The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 3 and 6. Therefore, H3 and H6 are equivalent. So one aromatic signal.\n\nThe other compound, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: as above, if the H's at 4 and 6 are not equivalent, then two signals. Wait, but earlier confusion. Let me recheck. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the H's are at 4 and 6. Position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). The substituents around each H are two methyls, but their positions are different. However, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 4 and 6, then H4 and H6 would be equivalent. Wait, but the methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Let me see: if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the ring through the center, position 1 swaps with 4, 2 swaps with 5, 3 swaps with 6. Therefore, H4 (originally at position 4) would move to position 1's original position, which is a methyl. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry is such that H4 and H6 are equivalent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are not. Let me think of the actual substituents. The H at position 4 is adjacent to methyls at 3 and 5. The H at position 6 is adjacent to methyls at 1 and 5. Since the substituents are different (position 4 has methyl at 3 and 5, position 6 has methyl at 1 and 5), their chemical environments are different. Therefore, two signals. \n\nTherefore, the two compounds would give 1 (from first) + 2 (from second) = 3 aromatic signals. But the problem states two signals. So Option B is out.\n\nOption C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has aromatic H's at 3 and 6 (equivalent, one signal).\n\nSecond compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. The aromatic H's are at positions 5 and 6. Wait, let me check. The methyl groups are at 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 have H's. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (methyl). Are these H's equivalent? Let me see symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 5 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees swaps positions 1\u21944, 2\u21943, so position 5 stays? Not sure. Alternatively, the H at position 5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, and position 6 is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Their environments are mirror images, so they are equivalent. Therefore, one aromatic signal from the second compound.\n\nTherefore, total aromatic signals: 1 +1 = 2, which matches the problem's two signals. Good.\n\nNow, the aliphatic region. Let's analyze each compound's aliphatic protons.\n\nFirst compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. As analyzed earlier, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. The symmetry gives two types of methyl groups: those at 1 and 5 (equivalent), and those at 2 and 4 (equivalent). Each pair has two methyl groups. So two signals in the aliphatic region. Each methyl group has 3 H's, so:\n\n- Methyls at 1 and 5: 2 methyls \u2192 6 H's.\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 4: 2 methyls \u2192 6 H's.\n\nTotal aliphatic H's: 12, which matches C10H14 (since aromatic H's are 2). \n\nSecond compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. As analyzed earlier, this has three types of methyl groups:\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 3 (equivalent): two methyls \u2192 6 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 1: 3 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 4: 3 H's.\n\nTotal aliphatic H's: 6 +3 +3 =12. \n\nTherefore, when mixed 1:1, the aliphatic signals would be:\n\nFrom first compound: two signals (each 6 H's).\n\nFrom second compound: three signals (6, 3, 3 H's).\n\nTotal signals: 2 +3 =5? But the problem states three signals. Hmm, so this might not be correct. Wait, but maybe some signals overlap between the two compounds?\n\nWait, let's see the chemical shifts. The first compound's methyl groups (positions 1,2,4,5):\n\n- The methyls at 1 and 5: adjacent to one methyl and one H. Their chemical shift might be around 2.2 ppm.\n\n- The methyls at 2 and 4: adjacent to two methyls. Their chemical shift might be different, maybe higher or lower.\n\nThe second compound's methyl groups:\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 3 (equivalent): adjacent to two methyls (positions 1 and 3 for position 2; positions 2 and 4 for position 3). Wait, actually, in the second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene), the methyl at position 2 is adjacent to methyls at 1 and 3. The methyl at position 3 is adjacent to methyls at 2 and 4. So those methyls at 2 and 3 are each adjacent to two methyls. So their chemical shift would be similar to the first compound's methyls at 2 and 4 (which are also adjacent to two methyls). So maybe their signals overlap.\n\nSimilarly, the methyls at 1 and 4 in the second compound are each adjacent to one methyl and one H. So their chemical shifts might be similar to the first compound's methyls at 1 and 5. \n\nTherefore, when mixed, the signals could overlap:\n\n- The methyls from both compounds that are adjacent to two methyls (first compound's 2/4 and second's 2/3) would combine into one signal. \n\n- The methyls from both compounds adjacent to one methyl and one H (first's 1/5 and second's 1/4) would combine into another signal. \n\nWait, but the second compound has methyls at 1 and 4 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H). The first compound has methyls at 1 and 5 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H). So all these methyl groups (first's 1/5 and second's 1/4) are in the same environment? Let me see:\n\nFirst compound's methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n\nSecond compound's methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6 (since in the second compound, position 6 has a H). Wait, in the second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene), position 6 has a H. So the methyl at position 1 in the second compound is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6, same as the first compound's methyl at 1. Similarly, the first compound's methyl at 5 is adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6. The second compound's methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. Wait, position 5 in the second compound has a H (since methyls are at 1,2,3,4). So the methyl at position 4 in the second compound is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. \n\nHmm, so the environments are slightly different. The first compound's methyl at 5 is adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6. The second compound's methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. Since the substituents are different (one has a H at 6, the other at 5), their chemical shifts might be different. Therefore, they might not overlap. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to count the signals:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\n- Two signals: one from methyls at 1/5 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H), and one from methyls at 2/4 (each adjacent to two methyls).\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl):\n\n- Three signals: one from methyls at 2/3 (adjacent to two methyls), one from methyl at 1 (adjacent to one methyl and one H), and one from methyl at 4 (adjacent to one methyl and one H).\n\nTherefore, when mixed, the total signals would be:\n\n- From first compound's methyls at 2/4 and second's at 2/3: if they overlap, that's one signal.\n\n- From first's methyls at 1/5, second's methyl at 1, and second's methyl at 4: these might form three separate signals unless some overlap.\n\nWait, this could result in four signals. But the problem states three signals. Hmm, maybe some of the methyl groups from the two compounds have the same environment. For example, the methyl at position 1 in both compounds might be in the same environment. Let me see:\n\nIn the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl), methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n\nIn the second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl), methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6. \n\nYes! Because in the second compound, position 6 has a H (since methyls are at 1,2,3,4). Therefore, the methyl at position 1 in both compounds has the same environment: adjacent to a methyl at 2 and a H at 6. Therefore, their chemical shifts would be the same. \n\nSimilarly, the methyl at position 5 in the first compound is adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6. In the second compound, the methyl at position 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. Wait, but position 5 in the second compound has a H. So the methyl at position 4 in the second compound is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. \n\nComparing to the first compound's methyl at 5: adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6. \n\nThese are different environments because one has a H at 6 and the other at 5. So their chemical shifts would be different. \n\nTherefore, the methyl groups at position 5 (first compound) and position 4 (second compound) would have different signals. \n\nSo total signals from the aliphatic region:\n\n- Methyls at 2/4 (first) and 2/3 (second): if their environments are the same, they would combine into one signal. \n\nWait, the methyls at 2 in the first compound are adjacent to methyl at 1 and 3 (but in first compound, position 3 has a H). Wait, no, in the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl), position 3 has a H. So methyl at position 2 is adjacent to methyl at 1 and H at 3. \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the first compound's methyl environments:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to methyl at 1 and H at 3.\n\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to methyl at 5 and H at 3.\n\n- Methyl at 5: adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6.\n\nWait, so the methyl at position 2 is adjacent to a methyl and a H (position 3). The methyl at position 4 is adjacent to a methyl and a H (position 3). Wait, position 3 is H for both. So methyls at 2 and 4 are each adjacent to a methyl and a H. Wait, but earlier I thought they were adjacent to two methyls. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, in the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\nPositions:\n\n1: methyl\n\n2: methyl\n\n3: H\n\n4: methyl\n\n5: methyl\n\n6: H\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Methyl at 1 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\n- Methyl at 2 is adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (H).\n\n- Methyl at 4 is adjacent to 3 (H) and 5 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\nTherefore, the methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are each adjacent to one methyl and one H. The methyl groups at 1 and 5 are also each adjacent to one methyl and one H. Wait a second! So all four methyl groups in the first compound are actually in the same environment? Because each is adjacent to one methyl and one H. \n\nWait, that can't be. Let me see:\n\nMethyl at 1: adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 6).\n\nMethyl at 2: adjacent to methyl (position 1) and H (position 3).\n\nMethyl at 4: adjacent to H (position 3) and methyl (position 5).\n\nMethyl at 5: adjacent to methyl (position 4) and H (position 6).\n\nSo each methyl is adjacent to one methyl and one H. However, the positions of the H's are different. For example, methyl at 1 has H at 6, while methyl at 2 has H at 3. But due to the symmetry of the molecule, these are equivalent. Let me see:\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 3 and 6. Reflecting over this plane swaps positions 1\u21945 and 2\u21944. Therefore, the methyl at position 1 is equivalent to the methyl at 5, and the methyl at 2 is equivalent to the methyl at 4. Therefore, there are two types of methyl groups:\n\n- Those at 1 and 5 (equivalent), each adjacent to a methyl and a H at 6 or 6.\n\nWait, position 1's H is at 6, and position 5's H is also at 6? No, position 5 is adjacent to position 6? Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Since position 6 is H, so methyl at 5 is adjacent to H at 6. Similarly, methyl at 1 is adjacent to H at 6. So both methyls at 1 and 5 are adjacent to H at 6. \n\nWait, but position 2's H is at 3, and position 4's H is also at 3 (since position 4 is adjacent to position 3's H). Therefore, the methyls at 2 and 4 are each adjacent to H at 3. \n\nTherefore, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are in the same environment (adjacent to H at 6 and a methyl), and those at 2 and 4 are in the same environment (adjacent to H at 3 and a methyl). Therefore, two types of methyl groups. So two signals in the aliphatic region. \n\nTherefore, the first compound has two signals. \n\nThe second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl):\n\nMethyl groups at 1,2,3,4. \n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (H).\n\nSo:\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 3 are each adjacent to two methyls.\n\n- Methyls at 1 and 4 are each adjacent to one methyl and one H.\n\nTherefore, three types of methyl groups:\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 3 (equivalent): two methyls \u2192 6 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 1: 3 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 4: 3 H's.\n\nThus, three signals in the aliphatic region.\n\nWhen mixed 1:1, the total aliphatic signals would be:\n\nFrom first compound:\n\n- Two signals (each 6 H's).\n\nFrom second compound:\n\n- Three signals (6, 3, 3 H's).\n\nTotal signals: 2 +3 =5? But the problem states three signals. Hmm, unless some signals overlap between the two compounds.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst compound's methyls at 1/5 (each adjacent to one methyl and H at 6) and second's methyl at 1 (same environment as first's 1/5). The first's methyls at 1/5 are 6 H's (since two methyls each with 3 H's). The second's methyl at 1 is 3 H's. Similarly, the first's methyls at 2/4 (each adjacent to one methyl and H at 3) and second's methyl at 4 (adjacent to one methyl and H at 5). Wait, the second's methyl at 4 is adjacent to H at 5, while first's methyl at 2/4 are adjacent to H at 3. \n\nWait, the first compound's methyl at 2 is adjacent to H at 3, and the second's methyl at 4 is adjacent to H at 5. Since the H's are in different positions, their chemical shifts might be different. \n\nHowever, the first compound's methyls at 1/5 are adjacent to H at 6, and the second's methyl at 1 is also adjacent to H at 6. So those methyls (first's 1/5 and second's 1) are in the same environment. Therefore, their signals would combine. \n\nSimilarly, the first's methyls at 2/4 (adjacent to H at 3) and the second's methyl at 4 (adjacent to H at 5) might have different environments. \n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nFirst compound's methyl groups:\n\n- Type A: positions 1 and 5 \u2192 adjacent to H at 6 and a methyl. Total H's: 6.\n\n- Type B: positions 2 and 4 \u2192 adjacent to H at 3 and a methyl. Total H's: 6.\n\nSecond compound's methyl groups:\n\n- Type C: positions 2 and 3 \u2192 adjacent to two methyls. Total H's: 6.\n\n- Type D: position 1 \u2192 adjacent to H at 6 and a methyl. Total H's: 3.\n\n- Type E: position 4 \u2192 adjacent to H at 5 and a methyl. Total H's: 3.\n\nWhen mixed:\n\n- Type A (6 H's) and Type D (3 H's) are in the same environment (adjacent to H at 6 and a methyl). So combined, they give a signal with 6+3=9 H's.\n\n- Type B (6 H's) and Type E (3 H's) are in different environments (H at 3 vs H at 5). So two separate signals.\n\n- Type C (6 H's) is a separate signal (adjacent to two methyls).\n\nTherefore, total signals: 3 (Type A+D, Type B, Type E, Type C). Wait, that's four signals. Hmm, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Type B and Type E are in the same environment? If the H at 3 and H at 5 are equivalent in some way? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the chemical shifts for Type B and Type E are close enough to be considered the same, but the problem states three signals at around 2.2 ppm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diethylbenzene is involved. Wait, no, this is option C which doesn't include diethylbenzene. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me consider the aliphatic integrals. The problem states three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nIf the two compounds contribute such that the total integrals are 2:1:1. Let's see:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\n- Two signals: 6 H's each.\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl):\n\n- Three signals: 6, 3, 3 H's.\n\nTotal aliphatic H's: 6+6+6+3+3 = 24? Wait, no, each compound has 12 H's. So total is 24. \n\nThe three signals in the problem have a ratio of 2:1:1. Total parts: 4. So the signals would have 12, 6, 6 H's (since 2+1+1=4 parts, 24/4=6 per part). \n\nLooking at the combined signals:\n\nIf the overlapping signals are:\n\n- Type A+D (9 H's) \u2192 but that's 9, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n- The two compounds' Type A and Type C (from second compound's two methyls at 2/3) might combine into one signal. \n\nWait, Type C (second's 2/3) are adjacent to two methyls, while Type B (first's 2/4) are adjacent to one methyl and H. So their chemical shifts would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound's Type B (6 H's) and second's Type E (3 H's) combine into a signal with 9 H's, and the other signals are Type A+D (9 H's) and Type C (6 H's). That would give three signals with ratios 9:9:6 \u2192 which simplifies to 3:3:2, not 2:1:1. \n\nHmm, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think differently. \n\nThe problem states three signals in the aliphatic region with a 2:1:1 ratio. That suggests that the total number of aliphatic protons is 2+1+1=4 parts. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally. So each compound must have aliphatic protons in a ratio that when doubled (because of 1:1 mixture) gives 2:1:1. \n\nWait, the total ratio is 2:1:1. So each part corresponds to 24 H's / (2+1+1) = 6 H per part. So the signals are 12, 6, 6 H's. \n\nEach compound must have aliphatic protons such that when combined, they give these numbers. \n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl) has two signals: 6 and 6 H's. \n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl) has three signals: 6, 3, 3 H's. \n\nCombined:\n\n- The 6 H's from first's first signal and 6 from second's first signal \u2192 12 H's (the 2 part).\n\n- The remaining 6 H's from first's second signal and the two 3's from second's other signals \u2192 but that would be 6+3+3=12, which doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6 from first's second signal and the 3+3 from second's other signals combine into two signals of 6+3=9 and 3? Not sure. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at the other options.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAromatic region:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl): aromatic H's at 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me see. The molecule has methyls at 1,2,3,4. The H's are at 5 and 6. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (methyl). \n\nPosition 5's H is adjacent to a methyl and a H. Position 6's H is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Their environments are mirror images, so they are equivalent. So one aromatic signal.\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl): as before, aromatic H's at 4 and 6. If they are not equivalent, two signals. \n\nTotal aromatic signals: 1 +2 =3. Problem states two, so Option D is out.\n\nBack to Option C. Maybe I made a mistake in the aromatic region. Let me recheck:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl): aromatic H's at 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between 3 and 6. Therefore, H3 and H6 are equivalent. One signal.\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl): aromatic H's at 5 and 6. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (methyl). Are they equivalent? The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between 5 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees swaps positions 1\u21944, 2\u21943, so position 5 stays? Not sure. Alternatively, the H at 5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, and H at 6 is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Their environments are mirror images, so equivalent. Therefore, one signal. \n\nThus, total aromatic signals: 1+1=2. Good.\n\nNow, aliphatic region:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\n- Two signals: 6 H's each (from methyls at 1/5 and 2/4).\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl):\n\n- Three signals: 6 (from 2/3), 3 (from 1), 3 (from 4).\n\nCombined:\n\n- The 6 H's from first's first signal and the 6 from second's first signal \u2192 12 H's (the 2 part).\n\n- The remaining 6 H's from first's second signal and the two 3's from second's other signals \u2192 but that's 6+3+3=12, which would need to be split into two signals of 6 each. \n\nWait, perhaps the 6 from first's second signal and the 3 from second's methyl at 1 (which is adjacent to H at 6) combine with the 3 from second's methyl at 4 (adjacent to H at 5). If those methyls at 4 and first's second signal (which are adjacent to H at 3) are in different environments, then they form two signals of 6+3 and 3. But that would be 9 and 3, which doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the methyls at 1 in both compounds (first's 1/5 and second's 1) combine into one signal (total 6+3=9 H's), and the other signals are first's 2/4 (6 H's) and second's 2/3 (6 H's). But that would be three signals with 9,6,6 \u2192 ratio 3:2:2, not 2:1:1.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound's methyls at 2/4 (adjacent to H at 3) and the second's methyl at 4 (adjacent to H at 5) are in the same environment? If the H at 3 and H at 5 are equivalent in some way. But they are not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the diethylbenzene is needed. Wait, no, option C doesn't include it. \n\nWait, the problem states three signals in the aliphatic region with a 2:1:1 ratio. The only way this can happen is if the two compounds contribute such that their combined aliphatic protons give three signals with those ratios. \n\nLet me think of the diethylbenzene again. Maybe I made a mistake in its analysis.\n\nOption A includes diethylbenzene. Let me recheck that.\n\nOption A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nAromatic region:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl): aromatic H's at 4 and 6. If they are not equivalent, two signals.\n\nSecond compound (1,4-diethylbenzene): aromatic H's at 2,3,5,6. Wait, no, earlier analysis said two signals. \n\nWait, diethylbenzene has two aromatic signals (positions 2/6 and 3/5). \n\nSo total aromatic signals: 2 (from first) +2 (from second) =4. Problem states two, so no.\n\nBut maybe the two compounds have overlapping aromatic signals. For example, if the H's in both compounds are at the same chemical shift. \n\nFirst compound's H's at 4 and 6: adjacent to two methyls each. Their chemical shift might be around 6.7 ppm.\n\nSecond compound's H's at 2/6 and 3/5: the H's at 2 and 6 are adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Their chemical shift might also be around 6.7 ppm. \n\nIf all aromatic H's are at ~6.7 ppm, then mixing would give two signals (each from one compound) but in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but each compound has two signals. \n\nAlternatively, if all aromatic H's are in the same environment, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound's H's at 4 and 6 are equivalent (one signal), and the second's H's are also equivalent (one signal). Then total two signals. \n\nLet me recheck:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl):\n\nH's at 4 and 6. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between 4 and 6, then H4 and H6 are equivalent. \n\nThe molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. \n\nIf you rotate 180 degrees around an axis through the center perpendicular to the ring, positions 1\u21944, 2\u21945, 3\u21946. \n\nPosition 4 (H) swaps with position 1 (methyl), so not symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 4 and 6. \n\nPosition 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). \n\nIf you reflect over the plane through 4-6 axis, position 3 swaps with position 1, but since both are methyls, it's symmetric. Therefore, H4 and H6 are equivalent. So one aromatic signal.\n\nSecond compound (1,4-diethylbenzene):\n\nThe aromatic H's are at 2,3,5,6. \n\nDue to symmetry, H's at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and H's at 3 and 5 are equivalent. So two signals. \n\nThus total aromatic signals: 1+2=3. Not matching.\n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with the diethylbenzene's aromatic signals. Let me recheck:\n\nIn 1,4-diethylbenzene, the H's are at positions 2,3,5,6. \n\nPosition 2 is adjacent to 1 (ethyl) and 3 (H). \n\nPosition 3 is adjacent to 2 (H) and 4 (ethyl). \n\nPosition 5 is adjacent to 4 (ethyl) and 6 (H). \n\nPosition 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (ethyl). \n\nTherefore, H's at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H. \n\nH's at 3 and 5 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H. \n\nWait, so all four H's are in the same environment? Because each is adjacent to one ethyl and one H. \n\nWait, position 2: adjacent to ethyl (position 1) and H (position 3).\n\nPosition 3: adjacent to H (position 2) and ethyl (position 4).\n\nPosition 5: adjacent to ethyl (position 4) and H (position 6).\n\nPosition 6: adjacent to H (position 5) and ethyl (position 1).\n\nSo each H is between an ethyl and a H."

            "label": "planning",
            "text": "Let me think about what that means.\n\nFirst, the aromatic protons. In aromatic compounds, the protons on the benzene ring typically resonate around 6-8 ppm. The fact that there are two singlets at ~6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio suggests that each compound in the mixture has a certain number of aromatic protons, and when mixed 1:1, the signals combine such that each compound contributes a singlet, but since they are in equal amounts, the integrals are 1:1. Wait, but if each compound has different numbers of aromatic protons, then their integrals would add up. Wait, maybe each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, so each gives a singlet, and since they are in 1:1 ratio, the integrals would be equal. So each compound must have the same number of aromatic protons? Because otherwise, their integrals would be different. For example, if one compound has 2 aromatic protons and the other has 4, then in a 1:1 mixture, the integrals would be 2:4, but since they are in 1:1, the total would be 2+4=6, but the ratio would be 2:4. Hmm, but the problem states that the two signals are in a 1:1 ratio. So that suggests that each compound contributes equally to each signal? Wait, maybe each compound has only one aromatic proton, but that can't be because tetramethylbenzenes would have some aromatic protons left. Wait, maybe each compound has two aromatic protons, so when mixed 1:1, each contributes two, so the total is 4, but the ratio between the two signals is 1:1. Wait, perhaps each compound has the same number of aromatic protons, so their signals are separate and each has the same integral. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, so each gives a singlet, and since they are in 1:1 ratio, the integrals of the two singlets are 1:1. That would make sense. So each compound must have the same number of aromatic protons. For example, if one compound has two aromatic protons and the other also has two, then in a 1:1 mixture, each contributes two, so the integrals would be 2:2, which is 1:1. Alternatively, if one has four and the other has four, same thing. Wait, but the problem says two signals, so each compound must have a different number of aromatic protons? Wait, no, if they have the same number, but different chemical shifts, then each would give a singlet, and the integrals would be the same. So that's possible.\n\nNow, moving on to the aliphatic protons. The three signals at ~2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a 2:1:1 ratio. Since they are all singlets, that suggests that each of these protons is in an environment where they are not adjacent to any other protons, so they don't have any neighboring hydrogens. The 2.2 ppm region is typical for methyl groups adjacent to a carbon with two methyl groups, like in isopropyl groups, but maybe in this case, they are just methyl groups attached to a carbon that's part of a larger structure. Alternatively, maybe they are methyl groups in a symmetric environment.\n\nWait, the problem states three signals at around 2.2 ppm, each a singlet, in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the total number of aliphatic protons would be 2 +1 +1 =4? Wait, but each signal's integral corresponds to the number of protons. Wait, the ratio is 2:1:1, so the total is 4 parts. But the actual number of protons would depend on the scale. But since it's a mixture, the integrals are relative. So each compound contributes to these signals. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound's contribution is doubled? Wait, maybe each compound has different aliphatic protons, so when mixed, the signals combine. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible compounds given:\n\nThe options are:\n\n1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\n2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\n3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n\n4. 1,4-diethylbenzene\n\nWe need to pick two of these that when mixed 1:1 give the described NMR spectrum.\n\nLet me analyze each compound's structure and NMR signals.\n\nStarting with the tetramethylbenzenes:\n\n1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: The methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. Let me draw this mentally. The benzene ring with methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. Let's see the symmetry here. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 4 and 5 are adjacent. The remaining positions are 3 and 6. Wait, but with four methyl groups, the positions would be 1,2,4,5. So the remaining two positions (3 and 6) are hydrogen. Wait, but in a tetramethylbenzene, four methyl groups replace four hydrogens. So the remaining two hydrogens are at positions 3 and 6. Are those equivalent? Let's see the symmetry. If the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5, then positions 3 and 6 are opposite each other. Are they equivalent? Let me think. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the 3-6 axis, so those two hydrogens would be equivalent. Therefore, there would be only one set of aromatic protons (the two hydrogens at 3 and 6), so a singlet at around 7 ppm maybe? Wait, but the problem says the aromatic signals are at ~6.7 ppm. Hmm, maybe the exact position depends on substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the aromatic protons are deshielded or shielded based on the substituents. Let me think. The methyl groups are electron-donating, so they would deshield the adjacent protons, but the protons opposite to the methyl groups might be more shielded. Wait, but in this case, the remaining hydrogens are at positions 3 and 6, which are adjacent to methyl groups? Wait, position 3 is adjacent to positions 2 and 4, which have methyl groups. Wait, position 3 is between 2 and 4, which are both methyl. So the H at position 3 is adjacent to two methyl groups. Similarly, position 6 is adjacent to positions 5 and 1. Position 5 has a methyl, position 1 has a methyl. So the H at position 6 is adjacent to two methyl groups as well. Therefore, both H3 and H6 are each adjacent to two methyl groups. Therefore, their chemical shifts would be similar, so they form a singlet. The chemical shift would be around 6.7 ppm? Maybe.\n\nNow, the aliphatic protons: each methyl group is attached to the benzene. Since the methyl groups are in different positions, but in this case, the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. Let's see if any of them are equivalent. The methyl groups at 1 and 5: position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (but 6 has a H?), wait no, position 1 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H). Wait, actually, the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. Let me think of the structure again. Let me number the benzene ring as follows:\n\n1: methyl\n\n2: methyl\n\n3: H\n\n4: methyl\n\n5: methyl\n\n6: H\n\nSo the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5. The H's are at 3 and 6. Now, the methyl groups at positions 1 and 5: position 1 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Wait, so the methyl at 1 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, while the methyl at 5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H. Are those equivalent? Let me see the symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the 3-6 axis. So position 1 and position 5 would be mirror images across that plane. Therefore, their methyl groups would be equivalent. Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 4: position 2 is adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (H). Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (H) and 5 (methyl). Wait, so position 2's methyl is adjacent to a methyl and a H, and position 4's methyl is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Hmm, but due to the symmetry, maybe they are equivalent? Let me think again. The molecule is symmetric along the 3-6 axis. So position 2 and position 4 would be mirror images. Therefore, their methyl groups are equivalent. So all four methyl groups are equivalent? Wait, but positions 1 and 5 are equivalent, and positions 2 and 4 are equivalent. Wait, but each pair is equivalent, so there are two types of methyl groups? Let me see:\n\nMethyl at 1: adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 6). \n\nMethyl at 2: adjacent to methyl (position 1) and H (position 3).\n\nWait, but due to the symmetry, the methyl at position 1 and position 5 are equivalent, and the methyl at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Wait, but position 5 is adjacent to position 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). So the methyl at position 5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, similar to position 1. So positions 1 and 5 are equivalent. Similarly, positions 2 and 4 are each adjacent to a methyl and a H, but on the other side. Wait, but maybe they are equivalent as well? Let me think of the molecule. If you rotate it 180 degrees around the axis through 3 and 6, position 1 swaps with 5, and 2 swaps with 4. Therefore, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, there are two types of methyl groups. Each type has two methyl groups. Therefore, the aliphatic protons would have two signals: one for the two methyl groups at positions 1 and 5, and another for the two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Each methyl group has 3 H's, so each signal would have 2*3=6 H's. Wait, but that would mean two signals at different chemical shifts, each with 6 H's. But the problem states three signals at 2.2 ppm. Hmm, so maybe my assumption is wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all four methyl groups are equivalent? Let me think again. If the molecule has more symmetry. Let me consider the actual structure. If the methyl groups are at 1,2,4,5, then the molecule is symmetric in such a way that all four methyl groups are equivalent? Wait, no. Let me try to imagine the structure. Let me think of the benzene ring with substituents:\n\nPositions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so that's a meta or ortho? Wait, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), then 4 and 5 are also adjacent (ortho). The positions 1,2,4,5 form a sort of rectangle? Maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the 3-6 axis, but not more. Therefore, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, two distinct methyl groups. Each methyl group would have a different chemical shift. So their signals would be two singlets at different ppm. But the problem says three signals at 2.2 ppm. Hmm, so maybe this compound isn't one of them? Or perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the methyl groups are all equivalent. Wait, if the molecule is symmetric in another way. Let me think of the positions again. If the substituents are at 1,2,4,5, then the molecule is actually 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Wait, perhaps this is actually 1,3,5,2-tetramethyl? Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is actually symmetric in a way that all four methyl groups are equivalent. Wait, maybe it's a square? Let me think of the benzene ring as a hexagon. Positions 1,2,4,5: if you place methyl groups at 1,2,4,5, then the remaining hydrogens are at 3 and 6. The molecule would have a plane of symmetry through 3-6, but the methyl groups are arranged such that each pair (1-5 and 2-4) are symmetric. Therefore, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and those at 2 and 4 are equivalent. Therefore, two types of methyl groups. So their chemical shifts would be different. Therefore, two signals for the aliphatic protons. But the problem states three signals. Hmm, so maybe this compound isn't part of the mixture? Let me check the other compounds.\n\nNext, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze this one. The methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,5. Let me see the structure. The remaining hydrogens would be at positions 4 and 6. Let's check symmetry. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). Wait, so the H at position 4 is between two methyls, and H at 6 is between two methyls. Are those equivalent? Let me see the symmetry. The molecule might have a plane of symmetry through positions 4 and 6? Wait, if the methyls are at 1,2,3,5, then the structure is a bit more complex. Let me try to visualize:\n\nPositions 1: methyl\n\n2: methyl\n\n3: methyl\n\n4: H\n\n5: methyl\n\n6: H\n\nSo the H's are at 4 and 6. Position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So both H4 and H6 are each adjacent to two methyl groups. Are they equivalent? Let's see symmetry. If you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around the axis through the center, position 1 swaps with 4, 2 swaps with 5, etc. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry through positions 3 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the H's at 4 and 6 are not equivalent. Let me think. The H at position 4 is adjacent to methyl groups at 3 and 5, while the H at 6 is adjacent to methyl groups at 5 and 1. Since the arrangement around the ring is different, maybe they are not equivalent. Therefore, there would be two different aromatic protons? Wait, but maybe they are still equivalent due to some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe they are in the same environment. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the chemical shifts. Both H4 and H6 are each next to two methyl groups, so their chemical shifts might be similar, but perhaps not exactly the same. Alternatively, maybe they are in the same environment. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through positions 3 and 6, making H4 and H6 equivalent? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are not equivalent, leading to two signals for aromatic protons. But the problem states that there are two signals in the aromatic region (6.7 ppm) in a 1:1 ratio. Hmm.\n\nNow, the aliphatic protons for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. The methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Let's see their equivalence. The methyl at position 1 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H). The methyl at 2 is adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (methyl). The methyl at 3 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (H). The methyl at 5 is adjacent to 4 (H) and 6 (H). Wait, so each methyl group's environment:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 6).\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to two methyls (positions 1 and 3).\n\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 4).\n\n- Methyl at 5: adjacent to H (positions 4 and 6? Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Position 4 is H, position 6 is H. So methyl at 5 is adjacent to two H's.\n\nWait, so the methyl at position 5 is adjacent to two H's. The methyl at position 1 is adjacent to one methyl and one H. The methyl at position 2 is adjacent to two methyls. The methyl at position 3 is adjacent to one methyl and one H. Therefore, the methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are similar but not the same? Wait, position 1 is adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 6). Position 3 is adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 4). Since positions 4 and 6 are different (position 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and 5, while position 6 is adjacent to methyl at 1 and 5), maybe the environments of the methyl groups at 1 and 3 are different. Therefore, each methyl group is in a unique environment. Therefore, there are four different methyl groups? Wait, but that can't be. Let me see:\n\nWait, the methyl at position 2 is adjacent to two methyls (positions 1 and 3). That's unique.\n\nThe methyl at position 5 is adjacent to two H's (positions 4 and 6). That's another unique environment.\n\nThe methyl at position 1 is adjacent to one methyl and one H (position 6). \n\nThe methyl at position 3 is adjacent to one methyl and one H (position 4). \n\nSo positions 1 and 3 are similar but not the same because their adjacent H's are in different positions. Therefore, each of these methyl groups would have different chemical shifts. So total of four different methyl groups? That would give four signals in the aliphatic region. But the problem states three signals. Hmm, so maybe this compound isn't part of the mixture either?\n\nMoving on to 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's analyze this. The methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,4. The remaining hydrogens are at positions 5 and 6. Let's see symmetry. The H's at 5 and 6: position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (methyl). Wait, so H5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, and H6 is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Are they equivalent? Let me see symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through positions 5 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees might swap them. Let me think. If you rotate the benzene ring 180 degrees, position 1 swaps with 4, 2 swaps with 3, etc. So position 5 would stay in place? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the H's at 5 and 6 are not equivalent. Therefore, two different aromatic protons. But the problem states two signals in the aromatic region. Hmm.\n\nNow, the aliphatic protons for 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. The methyl groups are at 1,2,3,4. Let's see their environments:\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (H).\n\nSo:\n\n- Methyl at 2 and 3 are each adjacent to two methyls. Wait, position 2 is between 1 and 3 (both methyl), so adjacent to two methyls. Position 3 is between 2 and 4 (both methyl), so also adjacent to two methyls. So methyls at 2 and 3 are equivalent?\n\n- Methyl at 1 is adjacent to one methyl and one H (position 6).\n\n- Methyl at 4 is adjacent to one methyl and one H (position 5).\n\nSo the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are similar but not the same. The methyls at 2 and 3 are equivalent. So total of three types of methyl groups: two at positions 2 and 3 (equivalent), one at 1, and one at 4. Wait, so that would be three signals in the aliphatic region. Each of the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would have their own signals, and the methyls at 2 and 3 would be one signal. So three signals. The integrals would be:\n\n- Methyl at 2 and 3: two methyl groups, each with 3 H's \u2192 6 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 1: 3 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 4: 3 H's.\n\nTotal aliphatic H's: 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. Which matches C10H14: 10 carbons, 14 hydrogens. The aromatic H's are 2 (positions 5 and 6), so total H's: 12 + 2 =14. Correct.\n\nSo the aliphatic region would have three signals: one at ~2.2 ppm (maybe) for the two methyl groups (positions 2 and 3), and two others. Wait, but the problem states three signals at around 2.2 ppm. So maybe all three signals are around 2.2? That might be possible if the chemical shifts are close. Alternatively, maybe the methyl groups are all in a similar environment. Wait, but their environments are different. The methyls at 2 and 3 are adjacent to two methyls, so they might be more shielded or deshielded compared to those at 1 and 4. Hmm, but the problem says all three signals are around 2.2 ppm. Let me think. The methyl groups adjacent to two methyls (positions 2 and 3) might have a different chemical shift than those adjacent to one methyl and a H. But maybe they are all in the 2.2 region. Alternatively, maybe the diethylbenzene contributes to some of the signals.\n\nNow, the last compound is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's analyze that. The structure is benzene with ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So the molecule has two ethyl groups. Let's see the structure:\n\nPositions 1 and 4 have ethyl groups. The remaining positions (2,3,5,6) have H's. Let's check symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 1 and 4. Therefore, the ethyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent. The H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. \n\nAromatic protons: positions 2,3,5,6. Since the molecule is symmetric through the 1-4 axis, positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and 3 and 5 are equivalent. Therefore, there are two types of aromatic protons. Each pair (2 &6, 3&5) would give two signals. So in the aromatic region, two signals. The chemical shifts would depend on their positions relative to the ethyl groups. The H's at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to an ethyl group (position 1 or 4) and a H. The H's at 3 and 5 are adjacent to two H's and one ethyl group? Wait, position 3 is adjacent to 2 (H) and 4 (ethyl). Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (ethyl) and 6 (H). Wait, so H at 3 is adjacent to an ethyl and a H, and H at 5 is adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Wait, so actually, positions 3 and 5 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (H) and 4 (ethyl). Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 (ethyl) and 6 (H). So their environments are similar. Therefore, the H's at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H (position 1 or 4's ethyl). Wait, position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (ethyl) and 3 (H). Wait, no, position 2 is adjacent to 1 (ethyl) and 3 (H). So H at position 2 is adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Similarly, H at position 6 is adjacent to position 5 (H) and 7? Wait, benzene only has six positions. Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (ethyl). So H at 6 is adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Therefore, the H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and the H's at 3 and 5 are also equivalent. Wait, but actually, positions 3 and 5 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H, similar to positions 2 and 6. Wait, no, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (H) and 4 (ethyl). Position 5 is adjacent to position 4 (ethyl) and 6 (H). So their environments are the same as positions 2 and 6. Wait, actually, maybe all four H's are equivalent? Wait, no. Let me think again. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the 1-4 axis. So positions 2 and 6 are mirror images, and 3 and 5 are mirror images. Therefore, the H's at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 are equivalent. Therefore, two signals in the aromatic region. \n\nNow, the aliphatic protons in 1,4-diethylbenzene. Each ethyl group has two CH2 and one CH3? Wait, no, an ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each ethyl group has a CH2 and a CH3. Since the ethyl groups are at positions 1 and 4, which are equivalent, each contributes the same protons. \n\nLooking at the ethyl groups:\n\nEach ethyl group has a CH2 adjacent to the benzene and a CH3. The CH2 protons are adjacent to the benzene and another CH2? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe ethyl group at position 1 is attached to the benzene at C1. The structure is: benzene-C1-CH2-CH3. Similarly for position 4. \n\nThe CH2 group is adjacent to the benzene (which is electron-withdrawing) and the CH3. The CH3 is adjacent to the CH2. \n\nThe protons on the CH2 (the two H's on each CH2) would be in a similar environment, and the CH3's would also be in a similar environment. Since there are two ethyl groups, each contributing a CH2 and a CH3, the total aliphatic protons are:\n\n- For each ethyl group: 2 (CH2) + 3 (CH3) = 5 H's. Two ethyl groups: 10 H's. \n\nBut wait, each CH2 has two H's, so two CH2 groups (from each ethyl) would have 2*2=4 H's, and two CH3 groups would have 2*3=6 H's. Total 10 H's. \n\nNow, the chemical shifts:\n\nThe CH2 protons adjacent to the benzene would be deshielded compared to the CH3. The CH2 protons might be around 2.5 ppm, and the CH3 around 1 ppm? Wait, but the problem mentions signals around 2.2 ppm. Alternatively, maybe the CH2 is around 2.2 ppm and the CH3 is lower. Let me think. The CH2 next to the benzene (which is electron-withdrawing) might have a chemical shift around 2.2 ppm, while the CH3 further away might be around 1.2 ppm. But the problem states that all three signals are around 2.2 ppm. Hmm, so maybe the CH3 is also around 2.2? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the diethylbenzene's aliphatic protons are all in the 2.2 region. Wait, perhaps the CH2 and CH3 are overlapping? Or maybe the diethyl groups are arranged such that their protons are in a symmetric environment. Wait, each ethyl group's CH2 and CH3 are in the same environment as the other ethyl group's. Therefore, the CH2's would be a singlet, and the CH3's would be another singlet. So two signals from the aliphatic region. But the problem states three signals. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CH2 protons are split into two signals due to some coupling? But the problem says all are singlets. So maybe the CH2 and CH3 are in different environments but still in the 2.2 region? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the diethylbenzene contributes two signals in the aliphatic region, and another compound contributes the third. Let me think.\n\nNow, going back to the problem. The mixture has two compounds in 1:1 ratio. The NMR shows two signals in the aromatic region (around 6.7 ppm) in a 1:1 ratio, and three signals in the aliphatic region (around 2.2 ppm) in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nOption A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nOption B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nOption C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nWe need to pick the pair that when mixed 1:1 gives the described NMR.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\nOption A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, the aromatic region:\n\nFor 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: as analyzed earlier, the aromatic H's are at positions 4 and 6. Wait, no, earlier I thought the remaining H's were at 4 and 6? Wait, let me recheck. The methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. So positions 4 and 6 have H's. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So both H's are adjacent to two methyls. Are they equivalent? Let me see symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 4 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees swaps positions 1\u21944 and 2\u21945, etc. Hmm, maybe the H's at 4 and 6 are not equivalent. Therefore, two signals in the aromatic region. \n\nThe 1,4-diethylbenzene has two aromatic signals (as analyzed earlier). \n\nSo when mixed, the total aromatic signals would be 2 (from tetramethyl) + 2 (from diethyl) = 4 signals? But the problem states two signals. Therefore, this can't be correct. Unless the two compounds have overlapping aromatic signals. \n\nWait, maybe the aromatic protons of both compounds are at the same chemical shift? For example, if both compounds have their aromatic H's at ~6.7 ppm, then mixing them would still give two signals (each from one compound) but in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but each compound has two aromatic signals? Then mixing would give four signals. Hmm, so this might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe one of the compounds has only one aromatic signal. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: the H's at 4 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me think of the structure again. The molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. The H's are at 4 and 6. Position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). The environment of H4 and H6 are similar: each is between two methyl groups. Therefore, they are equivalent. So only one aromatic signal from this compound. \n\nWait, that's different from my previous thought. If they are equivalent, then only one signal. Let me confirm symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 4 and 6, then yes, H4 and H6 would be equivalent. Wait, but the methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Let me imagine the benzene ring:\n\nPositions 1: methyl\n\n2: methyl\n\n3: methyl\n\n4: H\n\n5: methyl\n\n6: H\n\nIf you draw this, positions 1,2,3,5 have methyls. The H's are at 4 and 6. The molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the line connecting the midpoints between positions 1-6 and 3-4? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the ring through the center might swap positions 1\u21944, 2\u21945, 3\u21946. Wait, that would swap H4 with H1 (but H1 is a methyl). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetric enough for H4 and H6 to be equivalent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are not equivalent. Let me think of the substituents. The H at position 4 is adjacent to two methyl groups (positions 3 and 5), while the H at position 6 is adjacent to methyl groups at positions 1 and 5. Since the substituents around each H are different (position 4 has methyls at 3 and 5, position 6 has methyls at 1 and 5), their chemical environments are different. Therefore, they would have different chemical shifts. So two signals from the tetramethyl compound. \n\nThe diethylbenzene has two aromatic signals. So total of four signals in the aromatic region when mixed, which contradicts the problem's two signals. So Option A is out.\n\nOption B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, aromatic region:\n\n1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: as analyzed earlier, the aromatic H's are at positions 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me check again. The molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,4,5. The H's are at 3 and 6. Position 3 is between 2 (methyl) and 4 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). So each H is between two methyls. Are they equivalent? The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 3 and 6. Therefore, H3 and H6 are equivalent. So one aromatic signal.\n\nThe other compound, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: as above, if the H's at 4 and 6 are not equivalent, then two signals. Wait, but earlier confusion. Let me recheck. For 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the H's are at 4 and 6. Position 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). The substituents around each H are two methyls, but their positions are different. However, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 4 and 6, then H4 and H6 would be equivalent. Wait, but the methyl groups are at 1,2,3,5. Let me see: if you rotate the molecule 180 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the ring through the center, position 1 swaps with 4, 2 swaps with 5, 3 swaps with 6. Therefore, H4 (originally at position 4) would move to position 1's original position, which is a methyl. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry is such that H4 and H6 are equivalent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are not. Let me think of the actual substituents. The H at position 4 is adjacent to methyls at 3 and 5. The H at position 6 is adjacent to methyls at 1 and 5. Since the substituents are different (position 4 has methyl at 3 and 5, position 6 has methyl at 1 and 5), their chemical environments are different. Therefore, two signals. \n\nTherefore, the two compounds would give 1 (from first) + 2 (from second) = 3 aromatic signals. But the problem states two signals. So Option B is out.\n\nOption C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene has aromatic H's at 3 and 6 (equivalent, one signal).\n\nSecond compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. The aromatic H's are at positions 5 and 6. Wait, let me check. The methyl groups are at 1,2,3,4. So positions 5 and 6 have H's. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (methyl). Are these H's equivalent? Let me see symmetry. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 5 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees swaps positions 1\u21944, 2\u21943, so position 5 stays? Not sure. Alternatively, the H at position 5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, and position 6 is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Their environments are mirror images, so they are equivalent. Therefore, one aromatic signal from the second compound.\n\nTherefore, total aromatic signals: 1 +1 = 2, which matches the problem's two signals. Good.\n\nNow, the aliphatic region. Let's analyze each compound's aliphatic protons.\n\nFirst compound: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. As analyzed earlier, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5. The symmetry gives two types of methyl groups: those at 1 and 5 (equivalent), and those at 2 and 4 (equivalent). Each pair has two methyl groups. So two signals in the aliphatic region. Each methyl group has 3 H's, so:\n\n- Methyls at 1 and 5: 2 methyls \u2192 6 H's.\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 4: 2 methyls \u2192 6 H's.\n\nTotal aliphatic H's: 12, which matches C10H14 (since aromatic H's are 2). \n\nSecond compound: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. As analyzed earlier, this has three types of methyl groups:\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 3 (equivalent): two methyls \u2192 6 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 1: 3 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 4: 3 H's.\n\nTotal aliphatic H's: 6 +3 +3 =12. \n\nTherefore, when mixed 1:1, the aliphatic signals would be:\n\nFrom first compound: two signals (each 6 H's).\n\nFrom second compound: three signals (6, 3, 3 H's).\n\nTotal signals: 2 +3 =5? But the problem states three signals. Hmm, so this might not be correct. Wait, but maybe some signals overlap between the two compounds?\n\nWait, let's see the chemical shifts. The first compound's methyl groups (positions 1,2,4,5):\n\n- The methyls at 1 and 5: adjacent to one methyl and one H. Their chemical shift might be around 2.2 ppm.\n\n- The methyls at 2 and 4: adjacent to two methyls. Their chemical shift might be different, maybe higher or lower.\n\nThe second compound's methyl groups:\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 3 (equivalent): adjacent to two methyls (positions 1 and 3 for position 2; positions 2 and 4 for position 3). Wait, actually, in the second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene), the methyl at position 2 is adjacent to methyls at 1 and 3. The methyl at position 3 is adjacent to methyls at 2 and 4. So those methyls at 2 and 3 are each adjacent to two methyls. So their chemical shift would be similar to the first compound's methyls at 2 and 4 (which are also adjacent to two methyls). So maybe their signals overlap.\n\nSimilarly, the methyls at 1 and 4 in the second compound are each adjacent to one methyl and one H. So their chemical shifts might be similar to the first compound's methyls at 1 and 5. \n\nTherefore, when mixed, the signals could overlap:\n\n- The methyls from both compounds that are adjacent to two methyls (first compound's 2/4 and second's 2/3) would combine into one signal. \n\n- The methyls from both compounds adjacent to one methyl and one H (first's 1/5 and second's 1/4) would combine into another signal. \n\nWait, but the second compound has methyls at 1 and 4 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H). The first compound has methyls at 1 and 5 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H). So all these methyl groups (first's 1/5 and second's 1/4) are in the same environment? Let me see:\n\nFirst compound's methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n\nSecond compound's methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6 (since in the second compound, position 6 has a H). Wait, in the second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene), position 6 has a H. So the methyl at position 1 in the second compound is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6, same as the first compound's methyl at 1. Similarly, the first compound's methyl at 5 is adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6. The second compound's methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. Wait, position 5 in the second compound has a H (since methyls are at 1,2,3,4). So the methyl at position 4 in the second compound is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. \n\nHmm, so the environments are slightly different. The first compound's methyl at 5 is adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6. The second compound's methyl at 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. Since the substituents are different (one has a H at 6, the other at 5), their chemical shifts might be different. Therefore, they might not overlap. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to count the signals:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\n- Two signals: one from methyls at 1/5 (each adjacent to one methyl and one H), and one from methyls at 2/4 (each adjacent to two methyls).\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl):\n\n- Three signals: one from methyls at 2/3 (adjacent to two methyls), one from methyl at 1 (adjacent to one methyl and one H), and one from methyl at 4 (adjacent to one methyl and one H).\n\nTherefore, when mixed, the total signals would be:\n\n- From first compound's methyls at 2/4 and second's at 2/3: if they overlap, that's one signal.\n\n- From first's methyls at 1/5, second's methyl at 1, and second's methyl at 4: these might form three separate signals unless some overlap.\n\nWait, this could result in four signals. But the problem states three signals. Hmm, maybe some of the methyl groups from the two compounds have the same environment. For example, the methyl at position 1 in both compounds might be in the same environment. Let me see:\n\nIn the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl), methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n\nIn the second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl), methyl at 1 is adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6. \n\nYes! Because in the second compound, position 6 has a H (since methyls are at 1,2,3,4). Therefore, the methyl at position 1 in both compounds has the same environment: adjacent to a methyl at 2 and a H at 6. Therefore, their chemical shifts would be the same. \n\nSimilarly, the methyl at position 5 in the first compound is adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6. In the second compound, the methyl at position 4 is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. Wait, but position 5 in the second compound has a H. So the methyl at position 4 in the second compound is adjacent to methyl at 3 and H at 5. \n\nComparing to the first compound's methyl at 5: adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6. \n\nThese are different environments because one has a H at 6 and the other at 5. So their chemical shifts would be different. \n\nTherefore, the methyl groups at position 5 (first compound) and position 4 (second compound) would have different signals. \n\nSo total signals from the aliphatic region:\n\n- Methyls at 2/4 (first) and 2/3 (second): if their environments are the same, they would combine into one signal. \n\nWait, the methyls at 2 in the first compound are adjacent to methyl at 1 and 3 (but in first compound, position 3 has a H). Wait, no, in the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl), position 3 has a H. So methyl at position 2 is adjacent to methyl at 1 and H at 3. \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the first compound's methyl environments:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to methyl at 2 and H at 6.\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to methyl at 1 and H at 3.\n\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to methyl at 5 and H at 3.\n\n- Methyl at 5: adjacent to methyl at 4 and H at 6.\n\nWait, so the methyl at position 2 is adjacent to a methyl and a H (position 3). The methyl at position 4 is adjacent to a methyl and a H (position 3). Wait, position 3 is H for both. So methyls at 2 and 4 are each adjacent to a methyl and a H. Wait, but earlier I thought they were adjacent to two methyls. I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, in the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\nPositions:\n\n1: methyl\n\n2: methyl\n\n3: H\n\n4: methyl\n\n5: methyl\n\n6: H\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Methyl at 1 is adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\n- Methyl at 2 is adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (H).\n\n- Methyl at 4 is adjacent to 3 (H) and 5 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\nTherefore, the methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are each adjacent to one methyl and one H. The methyl groups at 1 and 5 are also each adjacent to one methyl and one H. Wait a second! So all four methyl groups in the first compound are actually in the same environment? Because each is adjacent to one methyl and one H. \n\nWait, that can't be. Let me see:\n\nMethyl at 1: adjacent to methyl (position 2) and H (position 6).\n\nMethyl at 2: adjacent to methyl (position 1) and H (position 3).\n\nMethyl at 4: adjacent to H (position 3) and methyl (position 5).\n\nMethyl at 5: adjacent to methyl (position 4) and H (position 6).\n\nSo each methyl is adjacent to one methyl and one H. However, the positions of the H's are different. For example, methyl at 1 has H at 6, while methyl at 2 has H at 3. But due to the symmetry of the molecule, these are equivalent. Let me see:\n\nThe molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 3 and 6. Reflecting over this plane swaps positions 1\u21945 and 2\u21944. Therefore, the methyl at position 1 is equivalent to the methyl at 5, and the methyl at 2 is equivalent to the methyl at 4. Therefore, there are two types of methyl groups:\n\n- Those at 1 and 5 (equivalent), each adjacent to a methyl and a H at 6 or 6.\n\nWait, position 1's H is at 6, and position 5's H is also at 6? No, position 5 is adjacent to position 6? Wait, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Since position 6 is H, so methyl at 5 is adjacent to H at 6. Similarly, methyl at 1 is adjacent to H at 6. So both methyls at 1 and 5 are adjacent to H at 6. \n\nWait, but position 2's H is at 3, and position 4's H is also at 3 (since position 4 is adjacent to position 3's H). Therefore, the methyls at 2 and 4 are each adjacent to H at 3. \n\nTherefore, the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are in the same environment (adjacent to H at 6 and a methyl), and those at 2 and 4 are in the same environment (adjacent to H at 3 and a methyl). Therefore, two types of methyl groups. So two signals in the aliphatic region. \n\nTherefore, the first compound has two signals. \n\nThe second compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl):\n\nMethyl groups at 1,2,3,4. \n\n- Methyl at 1: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 6 (H).\n\n- Methyl at 2: adjacent to 1 (methyl) and 3 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 3: adjacent to 2 (methyl) and 4 (methyl).\n\n- Methyl at 4: adjacent to 3 (methyl) and 5 (H).\n\nSo:\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 3 are each adjacent to two methyls.\n\n- Methyls at 1 and 4 are each adjacent to one methyl and one H.\n\nTherefore, three types of methyl groups:\n\n- Methyls at 2 and 3 (equivalent): two methyls \u2192 6 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 1: 3 H's.\n\n- Methyl at 4: 3 H's.\n\nThus, three signals in the aliphatic region.\n\nWhen mixed 1:1, the total aliphatic signals would be:\n\nFrom first compound:\n\n- Two signals (each 6 H's).\n\nFrom second compound:\n\n- Three signals (6, 3, 3 H's).\n\nTotal signals: 2 +3 =5? But the problem states three signals. Hmm, unless some signals overlap between the two compounds.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst compound's methyls at 1/5 (each adjacent to one methyl and H at 6) and second's methyl at 1 (same environment as first's 1/5). The first's methyls at 1/5 are 6 H's (since two methyls each with 3 H's). The second's methyl at 1 is 3 H's. Similarly, the first's methyls at 2/4 (each adjacent to one methyl and H at 3) and second's methyl at 4 (adjacent to one methyl and H at 5). Wait, the second's methyl at 4 is adjacent to H at 5, while first's methyl at 2/4 are adjacent to H at 3. \n\nWait, the first compound's methyl at 2 is adjacent to H at 3, and the second's methyl at 4 is adjacent to H at 5. Since the H's are in different positions, their chemical shifts might be different. \n\nHowever, the first compound's methyls at 1/5 are adjacent to H at 6, and the second's methyl at 1 is also adjacent to H at 6. So those methyls (first's 1/5 and second's 1) are in the same environment. Therefore, their signals would combine. \n\nSimilarly, the first's methyls at 2/4 (adjacent to H at 3) and the second's methyl at 4 (adjacent to H at 5) might have different environments. \n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nFirst compound's methyl groups:\n\n- Type A: positions 1 and 5 \u2192 adjacent to H at 6 and a methyl. Total H's: 6.\n\n- Type B: positions 2 and 4 \u2192 adjacent to H at 3 and a methyl. Total H's: 6.\n\nSecond compound's methyl groups:\n\n- Type C: positions 2 and 3 \u2192 adjacent to two methyls. Total H's: 6.\n\n- Type D: position 1 \u2192 adjacent to H at 6 and a methyl. Total H's: 3.\n\n- Type E: position 4 \u2192 adjacent to H at 5 and a methyl. Total H's: 3.\n\nWhen mixed:\n\n- Type A (6 H's) and Type D (3 H's) are in the same environment (adjacent to H at 6 and a methyl). So combined, they give a signal with 6+3=9 H's.\n\n- Type B (6 H's) and Type E (3 H's) are in different environments (H at 3 vs H at 5). So two separate signals.\n\n- Type C (6 H's) is a separate signal (adjacent to two methyls).\n\nTherefore, total signals: 3 (Type A+D, Type B, Type E, Type C). Wait, that's four signals. Hmm, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Type B and Type E are in the same environment? If the H at 3 and H at 5 are equivalent in some way? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the chemical shifts for Type B and Type E are close enough to be considered the same, but the problem states three signals at around 2.2 ppm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the diethylbenzene is involved. Wait, no, this is option C which doesn't include diethylbenzene. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Let me consider the aliphatic integrals. The problem states three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. \n\nIf the two compounds contribute such that the total integrals are 2:1:1. Let's see:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\n- Two signals: 6 H's each.\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl):\n\n- Three signals: 6, 3, 3 H's.\n\nTotal aliphatic H's: 6+6+6+3+3 = 24? Wait, no, each compound has 12 H's. So total is 24. \n\nThe three signals in the problem have a ratio of 2:1:1. Total parts: 4. So the signals would have 12, 6, 6 H's (since 2+1+1=4 parts, 24/4=6 per part). \n\nLooking at the combined signals:\n\nIf the overlapping signals are:\n\n- Type A+D (9 H's) \u2192 but that's 9, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n- The two compounds' Type A and Type C (from second compound's two methyls at 2/3) might combine into one signal. \n\nWait, Type C (second's 2/3) are adjacent to two methyls, while Type B (first's 2/4) are adjacent to one methyl and H. So their chemical shifts would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound's Type B (6 H's) and second's Type E (3 H's) combine into a signal with 9 H's, and the other signals are Type A+D (9 H's) and Type C (6 H's). That would give three signals with ratios 9:9:6 \u2192 which simplifies to 3:3:2, not 2:1:1. \n\nHmm, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me think differently. \n\nThe problem states three signals in the aliphatic region with a 2:1:1 ratio. That suggests that the total number of aliphatic protons is 2+1+1=4 parts. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes equally. So each compound must have aliphatic protons in a ratio that when doubled (because of 1:1 mixture) gives 2:1:1. \n\nWait, the total ratio is 2:1:1. So each part corresponds to 24 H's / (2+1+1) = 6 H per part. So the signals are 12, 6, 6 H's. \n\nEach compound must have aliphatic protons such that when combined, they give these numbers. \n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl) has two signals: 6 and 6 H's. \n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl) has three signals: 6, 3, 3 H's. \n\nCombined:\n\n- The 6 H's from first's first signal and 6 from second's first signal \u2192 12 H's (the 2 part).\n\n- The remaining 6 H's from first's second signal and the two 3's from second's other signals \u2192 but that would be 6+3+3=12, which doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6 from first's second signal and the 3+3 from second's other signals combine into two signals of 6+3=9 and 3? Not sure. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at the other options.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAromatic region:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl): aromatic H's at 5 and 6. Are they equivalent? Let me see. The molecule has methyls at 1,2,3,4. The H's are at 5 and 6. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (methyl). \n\nPosition 5's H is adjacent to a methyl and a H. Position 6's H is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Their environments are mirror images, so they are equivalent. So one aromatic signal.\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl): as before, aromatic H's at 4 and 6. If they are not equivalent, two signals. \n\nTotal aromatic signals: 1 +2 =3. Problem states two, so Option D is out.\n\nBack to Option C. Maybe I made a mistake in the aromatic region. Let me recheck:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl): aromatic H's at 3 and 6. Are they equivalent? The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between 3 and 6. Therefore, H3 and H6 are equivalent. One signal.\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl): aromatic H's at 5 and 6. Position 5 is adjacent to 4 (methyl) and 6 (H). Position 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (methyl). Are they equivalent? The molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between 5 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, rotating 180 degrees swaps positions 1\u21944, 2\u21943, so position 5 stays? Not sure. Alternatively, the H at 5 is adjacent to a methyl and a H, and H at 6 is adjacent to a H and a methyl. Their environments are mirror images, so equivalent. Therefore, one signal. \n\nThus, total aromatic signals: 1+1=2. Good.\n\nNow, aliphatic region:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl):\n\n- Two signals: 6 H's each (from methyls at 1/5 and 2/4).\n\nSecond compound (1,2,3,4-tetramethyl):\n\n- Three signals: 6 (from 2/3), 3 (from 1), 3 (from 4).\n\nCombined:\n\n- The 6 H's from first's first signal and the 6 from second's first signal \u2192 12 H's (the 2 part).\n\n- The remaining 6 H's from first's second signal and the two 3's from second's other signals \u2192 but that's 6+3+3=12, which would need to be split into two signals of 6 each. \n\nWait, perhaps the 6 from first's second signal and the 3 from second's methyl at 1 (which is adjacent to H at 6) combine with the 3 from second's methyl at 4 (adjacent to H at 5). If those methyls at 4 and first's second signal (which are adjacent to H at 3) are in different environments, then they form two signals of 6+3 and 3. But that would be 9 and 3, which doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the methyls at 1 in both compounds (first's 1/5 and second's 1) combine into one signal (total 6+3=9 H's), and the other signals are first's 2/4 (6 H's) and second's 2/3 (6 H's). But that would be three signals with 9,6,6 \u2192 ratio 3:2:2, not 2:1:1.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound's methyls at 2/4 (adjacent to H at 3) and the second's methyl at 4 (adjacent to H at 5) are in the same environment? If the H at 3 and H at 5 are equivalent in some way. But they are not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the diethylbenzene is needed. Wait, no, option C doesn't include it. \n\nWait, the problem states three signals in the aliphatic region with a 2:1:1 ratio. The only way this can happen is if the two compounds contribute such that their combined aliphatic protons give three signals with those ratios. \n\nLet me think of the diethylbenzene again. Maybe I made a mistake in its analysis.\n\nOption A includes diethylbenzene. Let me recheck that.\n\nOption A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nAromatic region:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl): aromatic H's at 4 and 6. If they are not equivalent, two signals.\n\nSecond compound (1,4-diethylbenzene): aromatic H's at 2,3,5,6. Wait, no, earlier analysis said two signals. \n\nWait, diethylbenzene has two aromatic signals (positions 2/6 and 3/5). \n\nSo total aromatic signals: 2 (from first) +2 (from second) =4. Problem states two, so no.\n\nBut maybe the two compounds have overlapping aromatic signals. For example, if the H's in both compounds are at the same chemical shift. \n\nFirst compound's H's at 4 and 6: adjacent to two methyls each. Their chemical shift might be around 6.7 ppm.\n\nSecond compound's H's at 2/6 and 3/5: the H's at 2 and 6 are adjacent to an ethyl and a H. Their chemical shift might also be around 6.7 ppm. \n\nIf all aromatic H's are at ~6.7 ppm, then mixing would give two signals (each from one compound) but in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but each compound has two signals. \n\nAlternatively, if all aromatic H's are in the same environment, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first compound's H's at 4 and 6 are equivalent (one signal), and the second's H's are also equivalent (one signal). Then total two signals. \n\nLet me recheck:\n\nFirst compound (1,2,3,5-tetramethyl):\n\nH's at 4 and 6. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the axis between 4 and 6, then H4 and H6 are equivalent. \n\nThe molecule has methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. \n\nIf you rotate 180 degrees around an axis through the center perpendicular to the ring, positions 1\u21944, 2\u21945, 3\u21946. \n\nPosition 4 (H) swaps with position 1 (methyl), so not symmetric. \n\nAlternatively, a plane of symmetry through the axis between positions 4 and 6. \n\nPosition 4 is between 3 (methyl) and 5 (methyl). Position 6 is between 5 (methyl) and 1 (methyl). \n\nIf you reflect over the plane through 4-6 axis, position 3 swaps with position 1, but since both are methyls, it's symmetric. Therefore, H4 and H6 are equivalent. So one aromatic signal.\n\nSecond compound (1,4-diethylbenzene):\n\nThe aromatic H's are at 2,3,5,6. \n\nDue to symmetry, H's at 2 and 6 are equivalent, and H's at 3 and 5 are equivalent. So two signals. \n\nThus total aromatic signals: 1+2=3. Not matching.\n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake with the diethylbenzene's aromatic signals. Let me recheck:\n\nIn 1,4-diethylbenzene, the H's are at positions 2,3,5,6. \n\nPosition 2 is adjacent to 1 (ethyl) and 3 (H). \n\nPosition 3 is adjacent to 2 (H) and 4 (ethyl). \n\nPosition 5 is adjacent to 4 (ethyl) and 6 (H). \n\nPosition 6 is adjacent to 5 (H) and 1 (ethyl). \n\nTherefore, H's at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H. \n\nH's at 3 and 5 are each adjacent to an ethyl and a H. \n\nWait, so all four H's are in the same environment? Because each is adjacent to one ethyl and one H. \n\nWait, position 2: adjacent to ethyl (position 1) and H (position 3).\n\nPosition 3: adjacent to H (position 2) and ethyl (position 4).\n\nPosition 5: adjacent to ethyl (position 4) and H (position 6).\n\nPosition 6: adjacent to H (position 5) and ethyl (position 1).\n\nSo each H is between an ethyl and a H.",
