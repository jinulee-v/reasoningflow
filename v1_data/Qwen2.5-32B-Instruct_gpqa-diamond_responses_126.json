        "question": "Which of the following molecules is formed when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated?\nA. 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene\nB. 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene\nC. 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene\nD. 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene",
        "response": "When 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated, an alkyl shift can occur, leading to the formation of a more stable carbocation intermediate. The butyl group (C4H9) can rearrange to form a more stable structure. In this case, the butyl group can break down into an ethyl (C2H5) and a methyl (CH3) group through a 1,3-hydride or methyl shift mechanism, which typically leads to the formation of a more stable double bond system.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 5-ethylundeca-2,6-diene - This molecule has an extra carbon compared to the original molecule, which doesn't match the expected outcome.\nB. 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene - This molecule matches the expected rearrangement where the butyl group splits into an ethyl and a methyl group, and the double bonds remain in their original positions.\nC. 4-ethyl-3-methyldeca-1,5-diene - This molecule has a different numbering for the substituents and a different position for the double bonds, which does not align with the expected rearrangement.\nD. 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene - This is identical to option B, which is the correct answer based on the described rearrangement.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. 5-ethyl-4-methyldeca-2,6-diene**."
