        "question": "Let $\\omega \\neq 1$ be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when \n\\[ \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) \\] is divided by 1000.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \u220f\u2096=0\u00b9\u00b2 (2 - 2\u03c9\u1d4f + \u03c9\u00b2\u1d4f) is divided by 1000, where \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity. Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of roots of unity and cyclotomic polynomials. \n\nFirst, since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation \u03c9\u00b9\u00b3 = 1. The minimal polynomial for \u03c9 over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. Let me think.\n\nThe product given is over all 13th roots of unity, except \u03c9 \u2260 1. Wait, actually, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes all 13th roots of unity, including 1. But the problem statement says \u03c9 \u2260 1, so maybe \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity? Wait, no, the problem says \"Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity.\" So \u03c9 is one of the 13th roots of unity, not equal to 1. But then the product is over k from 0 to 12, so \u03c9\u2070, \u03c9\u00b9, ..., \u03c9\u00b9\u00b2. Wait, but if \u03c9 is a specific 13th root of unity, then \u03c9\u2070 is 1, \u03c9\u00b9 is \u03c9, \u03c9\u00b2 is \u03c9 squared, etc. So actually, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. But the problem says \u03c9 \u2260 1. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me parse the problem again. It says: \"Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when \u220f\u2096=0\u00b9\u00b2 (2 - 2\u03c9\u1d4f + \u03c9\u00b2\u1d4f) is divided by 1000.\" So \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity not equal to 1, and the product is over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9\u1d4f + \u03c9\u00b2\u1d4f). Wait, but if \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, then \u03c9\u1d4f for k from 0 to 12 would cycle through all 13th roots of unity. But if \u03c9 is not primitive, then maybe it's a root of unity of lower order? Wait, but 13 is prime, so all roots except 1 are primitive. So \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity. Therefore, \u03c9\u2070, \u03c9\u00b9, ..., \u03c9\u00b9\u00b2 are all distinct 13th roots of unity. Therefore, the product is over all 13th roots of unity of the expression (2 - 2\u03b7 + \u03b7\u00b2), where \u03b7 ranges over all 13th roots of unity. Wait, but the problem says \"Let \u03c9 \u2260 1 be a 13th root of unity,\" but then the product is over k=0 to 12, which would include \u03b7 = \u03c9\u2070 = 1, \u03b7 = \u03c9\u00b9, ..., \u03b7 = \u03c9\u00b9\u00b2. So maybe the problem is just asking for the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2\u03b7 + \u03b7\u00b2), and then find that product modulo 1000. But why does it mention \u03c9 \u2260 1? Maybe it's just emphasizing that \u03c9 is a primitive root? Hmm.\n\nAnyway, regardless of that, perhaps the key is to compute the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2\u03b7 + \u03b7\u00b2). Let me denote the polynomial P(x) = 2 - 2x + x\u00b2. Then the product we need is \u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} P(\u03b7). Since the roots of x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 = 0 are the 13th roots of unity, so the product over all \u03b7 of P(\u03b7) is the product of P(\u03b7) as \u03b7 ranges over all roots of x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 = 0. \n\nThere's a theorem that says that for a polynomial Q(x), the product over all roots of a polynomial f(x) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and Q(x), or something like that. Alternatively, if we have a polynomial f(x) = \u220f_{i=1}^n (x - \u03b1_i), then \u220f_{i=1}^n Q(\u03b1_i) = Res_x(f(x), Q(x)), where Res is the resultant. But maybe there's a simpler way here.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 factors as (x - 1)\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x), where \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. Then, the product over all 13th roots of unity of P(\u03b7) would be P(1) times the product of P(\u03b7) as \u03b7 ranges over the primitive 13th roots of unity. So:\n\n\u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} P(\u03b7) = P(1) * \u220f_{\u03b7 primitive} P(\u03b7)\n\nBut maybe instead of separating it out, we can consider the entire product. Let me recall that for a polynomial f(x) = \u220f_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - \u03b1_k), then \u220f_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\u03b1_k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and Q(x). But perhaps more straightforwardly, if we can write Q(x) as a polynomial, then the product \u220f_{k=0}^{n-1} Q(\u03b1_k) is equal to the product of Q evaluated at each root of f(x). \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 = 0, so \u03b7\u00b9\u00b3 = 1 for each root \u03b7. Therefore, we can write the product \u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} (2 - 2\u03b7 + \u03b7\u00b2) as the product over \u03b7 of (\u03b7\u00b2 - 2\u03b7 + 2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate this product to evaluating a certain polynomial at x=1. Wait, if we have a polynomial Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, then the product \u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} Q(\u03b7) is equal to the product of Q(\u03b7) for each \u03b7 such that \u03b7\u00b9\u00b3 = 1. \n\nBut how do we compute such a product? There's a formula that says that if f(x) = \u220f_{k=1}^n (x - \u03b1_k), then \u220f_{k=1}^n Q(\u03b1_k) = Res_x(f(x), Q(x)). But I don't remember exactly how resultants work. Alternatively, maybe we can use complex analysis or properties of cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: Since \u03b7 runs over all 13th roots of unity, the product is equal to the value of the polynomial Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 evaluated at each 13th root of unity and multiplied together. So, \u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} (\u03b7\u00b2 - 2\u03b7 + 2). \n\nThis product can be related to the resultant of x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 and Q(x). The resultant Res_x(x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, Q(x)) is equal to the product of Q(\u03b7) for each root \u03b7 of x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1. So, \u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} Q(\u03b7) = Res_x(x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, Q(x)). \n\nAlternatively, since Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2, we can write x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0 \u21d2 x = [2 \u00b1 \u221a(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 \u00b1 \u221a(-4)]/2 = 1 \u00b1 i. So Q(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, the resultant Res_x(x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, Q(x)) would be (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 evaluated at x = 1 + i) * (x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1 evaluated at x = 1 - i). Therefore, the product \u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} Q(\u03b7) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ). \n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check this. If Q(x) factors as (x - a)(x - b), then the resultant Res_x(f(x), Q(x)) is f(a)f(b). So yes, if Q(x) = (x - a)(x - b), then the product over roots \u03b7 of f(x) of Q(\u03b7) is \u220f_{\u03b7} (\u03b7 - a)(\u03b7 - b) = \u220f_{\u03b7} (\u03b7 - a) * \u220f_{\u03b7} (\u03b7 - b) = f(a) * f(b). Therefore, in our case, since Q(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), then the product \u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} Q(\u03b7) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ). \n\nTherefore, the product we need is [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ]. Let me compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13. \n\nFirst, let's compute (1 + i)^n. We know that (1 + i) has magnitude \u221a2 and angle \u03c0/4, so (1 + i)^n = (\u221a2)^n * e^(i n \u03c0/4). Similarly, (1 - i) has magnitude \u221a2 and angle -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^n = (\u221a2)^n * e^(-i n \u03c0/4).\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^(i 13\u03c0/4) = 2^(13/2) * e^(i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)) = 2^(6.5) * e^(i \u03c0/4 + i 3\u03c0) = 2^(6.5) * (-1) * e^(i \u03c0/4) = -2^(6.5) * (cos \u03c0/4 + i sin \u03c0/4) = -2^(6.5) * (\u221a2/2 + i \u221a2/2) = -2^(6.5) * (\u221a2/2)(1 + i) = -2^(6.5) * 2^(-0.5) * (1 + i) = -2^6 * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i). \n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 = (\u221a2)^13 * e^(-i 13\u03c0/4) = 2^(6.5) * e^(-i (3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4)) = 2^(6.5) * (-1) * e^(-i \u03c0/4) = -2^(6.5) * (cos(-\u03c0/4) + i sin(-\u03c0/4)) = -2^(6.5) * (\u221a2/2 - i \u221a2/2) = -2^(6.5) * (\u221a2/2)(1 - i) = -2^6 * (1 - i) = -64(1 - i). \n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 + i) - 1 = -65 - 64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 - 1 = -64(1 - i) - 1 = -65 + 64i. \n\nMultiplying these two results: (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify that calculation again. \n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13: \n\n(1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1 + i) = -64(1 + i). \n\nYes, that's correct. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i). \n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nMultiplying these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i\u00b2) = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. \n\nSo the product is 8321. Therefore, the original product \u220f\u2096=0\u00b9\u00b2 (2 - 2\u03c9\u1d4f + \u03c9\u00b2\u1d4f) equals 8321. Then, we need to find 8321 mod 1000. \n\n8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with remainder 321. Therefore, the remainder is 321. \n\nWait, but let me check again. 8321 divided by 1000: 1000*8=8000, 8321-8000=321. So yes, remainder 321. \n\nBut let me confirm once more that the product is indeed 8321. Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, there might be a step where I missed a sign or something. Let me retrace the steps:\n\n1. Expressed the product as \u220f_{\u03b7^13=1} (\u03b7\u00b2 - 2\u03b7 + 2).\n\n2. Factored the quadratic as (\u03b7 - (1 + i))(\u03b7 - (1 - i)).\n\n3. Therefore, the product over all \u03b7 is equal to [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 - i)^13 -1].\n\n4. Calculated (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), so (1 + i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i.\n\n5. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i.\n\n6. Multiply them: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Wait, hold on, actually, (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) is (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321. \n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to compute this product, maybe using properties of cyclotomic polynomials or something else, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, note that the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2\u03b7 + \u03b7\u00b2) can be written as the product over \u03b7 of (\u03b7\u00b2 - 2\u03b7 + 2). Let me denote f(\u03b7) = \u03b7\u00b2 - 2\u03b7 + 2. Then, since \u03b7\u00b9\u00b3 = 1, we can write \u03b7\u00b2 = \u03b7\u207b\u00b9\u00b9, \u03b7 = \u03b7, so f(\u03b7) = \u03b7\u207b\u00b9\u00b9 - 2\u03b7 + 2. Not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that \u03b7 runs through all 13th roots of unity, so we can consider the product as Res_x(x\u00b9\u00b3 - 1, x\u00b2 - 2x + 2). Which is the same as evaluating x\u00b9\u00b3 -1 at x = roots of x\u00b2 -2x +2, which are 1 \u00b1 i, and multiplying those evaluations. Which is exactly what we did earlier. So that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8321 mod 1000 = 321. \n\nBut wait, let me check if 8321 is indeed correct. Let me compute (1 + i)^13 -1 and (1 - i)^13 -1 again step by step.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^1 = 1 + i.\n\n(1 + i)^2 = (1 + i)(1 + i) = 1 + 2i + i\u00b2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)(2i) = 2i + 2i\u00b2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (-2 + 2i)(1 + i) = -2(1 + i) + 2i(1 + i) = -2 -2i + 2i + 2i\u00b2 = -2 + 0i -2 = -4.\n\n(1 + i)^4 = -4, as before.\n\n(1 + i)^5 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i) = -4(1 + i) = -4 -4i.\n\n(1 + i)^6 = (-4 -4i)(1 + i) = -4(1 + i) -4i(1 + i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i\u00b2 = -4 -8i +4 = -8i.\n\n(1 + i)^7 = (-8i)(1 + i) = -8i -8i\u00b2 = -8i +8 = 8 -8i.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = (8 -8i)(1 + i) = 8(1 + i) -8i(1 + i) = 8 +8i -8i -8i\u00b2 = 8 +0i +8 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^8 = 16.\n\n(1 + i)^9 = 16(1 + i) = 16 +16i.\n\n(1 + i)^10 = (16 +16i)(1 + i) = 16(1 + i) +16i(1 + i) = 16 +16i +16i +16i\u00b2 = 16 +32i -16 = 32i.\n\n(1 + i)^10 = 32i.\n\n(1 + i)^11 = 32i(1 + i) = 32i +32i\u00b2 = 32i -32 = -32 +32i.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = (-32 +32i)(1 + i) = -32(1 + i) +32i(1 + i) = -32 -32i +32i +32i\u00b2 = -32 +0i -32 = -64.\n\n(1 + i)^12 = -64.\n\n(1 + i)^13 = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i. \n\nYes, that's correct. So (1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i). Therefore, (1 + i)^13 -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = -64(1 - i), so (1 - i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i. Multiplying these gives (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (-4096) = 8321. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So the answer is 321. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's another approach. For example, using the fact that the product over all roots of unity of a polynomial can sometimes be evaluated using properties of cyclotomic polynomials or by considering the factorization of the polynomial modulo x\u00b9\u00b3 -1.\n\nAlternatively, note that the given product is \u220f\u2096=0\u00b9\u00b2 (2 - 2\u03c9\u1d4f + \u03c9\u00b2\u1d4f). Let me rewrite each term as \u03c9\u00b2\u1d4f - 2\u03c9\u1d4f + 2. Let me denote z = \u03c9\u1d4f, so each term is z\u00b2 - 2z + 2. Therefore, the product is \u220f_{z\u00b9\u00b3=1} (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). \n\nIf we consider the function f(z) = z\u00b2 - 2z + 2, then the product over all z\u00b9\u00b3=1 of f(z) is equal to the resultant of z\u00b9\u00b3 -1 and f(z). As we discussed earlier, this resultant is f(1 + i) * f(1 - i) multiplied by other factors if f(z) has more roots, but since f(z) is quadratic, it's just the product over its roots. Wait, no, the resultant Res_z(z\u00b9\u00b3 -1, z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) evaluated at each root of z\u00b9\u00b3 -1, which is the same as the product we're trying to compute. But as per the property of resultants, if we have two polynomials A(z) and B(z), then Res_z(A, B) is equal to the product of B evaluated at each root of A, times the leading coefficient of A raised to the degree of B. But in our case, A(z) = z\u00b9\u00b3 -1, which is monic, so leading coefficient is 1, and B(z) = z\u00b2 - 2z + 2, which has degree 2. Therefore, Res_z(A, B) = \u220f_{\u03b1: A(\u03b1)=0} B(\u03b1) = our product. \n\nBut another formula for the resultant of two polynomials A(z) and B(z) is the product of B(\u03b1) over all roots \u03b1 of A(z). So yes, that's exactly our case. Therefore, Res_z(z\u00b9\u00b3 -1, z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) = \u220f_{z\u00b9\u00b3=1} (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) = 8321. \n\nAlternatively, using another formula for the resultant, which is the determinant of the Sylvester matrix. But that would be more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, note that z\u00b2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), so the product over all z\u00b9\u00b3=1 of (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) is equal to \u220f_{z\u00b9\u00b3=1} (z - (1 + i)) * \u220f_{z\u00b9\u00b3=1} (z - (1 - i)) = ( (1 + i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 - i)^13 -1 ), which is exactly what we computed earlier. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, we arrive at the product being 8321, which modulo 1000 is 321. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}"
