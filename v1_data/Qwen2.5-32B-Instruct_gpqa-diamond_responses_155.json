        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the chemical transformations that occur in each reaction and how they affect the resulting products.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n**Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA and aqueous acid**\n- **mCPBA (meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid)** oxidizes the alkene to form an epoxide.\n- The (E)-configuration of oct-4-ene will lead to the formation of an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry.\n- Upon treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a secondary alcohol. The stereochemistry at the carbon where the ring opens will depend on the initial configuration of the alkene and the regioselectivity of the epoxidation and subsequent ring-opening steps.\n\n**Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA and aqueous acid**\n- Similar to Reaction 1, the (Z)-configuration of oct-4-ene will also be converted to an epoxide.\n- The stereochemistry of the resulting epoxide will differ from that formed from the (E)-isomer due to the different starting geometry.\n- After treatment with aqueous acid, the epoxide will open to form a secondary alcohol, but the stereochemistry at the carbon where the ring opens will be different compared to the (E)-isomer.\n\n### Product Analysis\n\n- **Standard (achiral) Reverse-Phase HPLC**: This type of HPLC separates compounds based on their hydrophobicity. Since the products from both reactions are secondary alcohols derived from the same alkene backbone but with different stereochemistries, they may have similar hydrophobic properties. However, the exact separation depends on the subtle differences in their structures. Typically, if the stereochemistry leads to significant differences in retention times, you might see separate peaks for each isomer. Given the conditions stated, it's reasonable to assume that the achiral HPLC would show 2 distinct peaks corresponding to the two different stereoisomers formed from the (E) and (Z) alkenes.\n\n- **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral HPLC can distinguish between enantiomers or diastereomers based on their interaction with a chiral stationary phase. In this case, since the (E) and (Z) alkenes lead to different stereochemistries in the final products, and each product could potentially exist as a pair of enantiomers, you would expect to see 4 distinct peaks: two for the (E)-derived product and two for the (Z)-derived product.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n- **Standard (achiral) HPLC**: 2 peaks (one for each stereoisomer).\n- **Chiral HPLC**: 4 peaks (two for each stereoisomer).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC**\n\nHowever, considering the typical behavior of achiral HPLC, which usually cannot resolve enantiomers unless there is a significant difference in their physical properties, the more accurate observation would be:\n\n**D. 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC**"
