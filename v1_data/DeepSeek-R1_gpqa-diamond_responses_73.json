        "question": "We want to observe a decay of a single atom (atomic nucleus). It is possible to obtain this atom (e.g., from a beta decay of another atom) and start monitoring right away. We know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\nSo far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?\nA. 48%\nB. 44%\nC. 40%\nD. 52%",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. The initial information is that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Hmm, let me recall how radioactive decay probabilities work. I think it's related to exponential decay and the concept of half-life, but here they're giving a probability over a specific time rather than a half-life. \n\nFirst, let me confirm: radioactive decay is a memoryless process, right? That means the probability of decay in a future time interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, even though 50 minutes have already passed without decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes should be calculated based on the remaining time from the atom's perspective. Wait, but the original decay probability is given for 100 minutes. So maybe I need to model this using the exponential distribution?\n\nThe exponential distribution is characterized by the decay constant \u03bb, where the probability of decay within time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). Since we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or 0.32, we can solve for \u03bb. Let me write that down:\n\n0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb)\n\nSolving for \u03bb:\n\ne^(-100\u03bb) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n-100\u03bb = ln(0.68)\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bb = -ln(0.68)/100\n\nLet me compute that. First, ln(0.68). Let me approximate ln(0.7) is about -0.35667, and ln(0.68) should be a bit more negative. Let me check with a calculator. Hmm, ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. So,\n\n\u03bb \u2248 0.38566 / 100 \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nOkay, so the decay constant \u03bb is approximately 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, since the atom has already survived 50 minutes, the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes is the conditional probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it has not decayed by 50 minutes. Because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, this should be equivalent to the probability that it decays within 150 minutes starting from time 0. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. The memoryless property says that the remaining time until decay is the same as a fresh start. So, if it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that a new atom decays in 150 minutes. But wait, the original decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So maybe I need to check if the 32% probability over 100 minutes aligns with an exponential model.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a simpler approach without assuming exponential decay? Let me think. The problem states that \"we know from previous experiments that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes.\" So perhaps the decay isn't necessarily following an exponential distribution? But in reality, nuclear decay is memoryless and follows an exponential distribution. However, maybe the problem is using a different model? Wait, but if it's not exponential, then we need more information to calculate the conditional probability. Since the problem doesn't specify the distribution, but in real life, nuclear decay is exponential, so maybe we should go with that.\n\nSo, proceeding with the exponential distribution assumption. Then, as per memoryless property, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes. Wait, but originally, the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%. So maybe there's a mismatch here. Wait, if we model it as exponential, then the decay probability within t minutes is 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). Given that 1 - e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.32, so \u03bb is as we calculated. Then, the probability of decaying within 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-150\u03bb). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 150\u03bb: 150 * 0.0038566 \u2248 0.57849.\n\nThen, e^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488, so 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let me compute it more accurately. Let's see:\n\nUsing a calculator, e^-0.57849 \u2248 0.5602.\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.5602 \u2248 0.4398, or approximately 44%. So that would be answer B, 44%.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, the question is: given that it has survived 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So total time from the start is 200 minutes. But conditional on surviving 50 minutes, the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is equal to [P(decay in 200 minutes) - P(decay in 50 minutes)] divided by [1 - P(decay in 50 minutes)].\n\nBut if we use the exponential model, then:\n\nP(decay between 50 and 200 minutes | survived 50 minutes) = P(decay in next 150 minutes) = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb) \u2248 44%, as before.\n\nAlternatively, compute it using the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(decay between 50 and 200 | survive until 50) = [P(decay by 200) - P(decay by 50)] / P(survive until 50)\n\nBut with exponential distribution, P(decay by t) = 1 - e^(-\u03bbt). So:\n\n[ (1 - e^(-200\u03bb)) - (1 - e^(-50\u03bb)) ] / e^(-50\u03bb) = [ e^(-50\u03bb) - e^(-200\u03bb) ] / e^(-50\u03bb) = 1 - e^(-150\u03bb)\n\nWhich is the same result as the memoryless property. So indeed, 44%.\n\nBut let me check if the answer is 44%, which is option B. So that's probably the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be solved without assuming the exponential distribution? For example, if the decay has a fixed probability per unit time, but not memoryless. Wait, but in that case, without knowing the distribution, we can't compute the conditional probability. The only way to compute the conditional probability is if we have more information. Since the problem gives only the probability over 100 minutes, unless it's a uniform distribution over the 100 minutes? But that's not how nuclear decay works. If it were uniform, then the probability density function would be constant, but that's not the case. However, maybe the problem is assuming a uniform probability? Let's see.\n\nWait, if the decay has a 32% chance to happen within 100 minutes, and if the decay time is uniformly distributed over 0 to 100 minutes, then the probability density function would be 0.32/100 = 0.0032 per minute. But in that case, the conditional probability after 50 minutes would be the probability that it decays between 50 and 100 minutes, divided by the probability it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes. So:\n\nOriginal total probability in 100 minutes: 32%. If uniform, then the cumulative distribution function is linear: P(decay by t) = 0.32 * (t / 100) for t between 0 and 100. Then, the conditional probability P(decay in next 50 minutes | survived 50 minutes) would be [P(decay in 100) - P(decay in 50)] / [1 - P(decay in 50)] = [0.32 - 0.16] / [1 - 0.16] = 0.16 / 0.84 \u2248 0.1905 or 19.05%. But the question here is about decaying in the next 150 minutes, but if the original distribution is only up to 100 minutes, then extending beyond that would have zero probability? That doesn't make sense. So if the decay is certain to happen within 100 minutes with 32% probability, which is contradictory. Wait, maybe the problem is not assuming uniform distribution. The question is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut given that in reality, nuclear decay is memoryless and follows an exponential distribution, and given that the problem mentions \"decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes\", which aligns with the exponential distribution (since for an exponential distribution, the probability of decay within a certain time is a fixed value), I think the correct approach is to use the exponential model.\n\nTherefore, calculating \u03bb as we did, then using the memoryless property to find the probability of decay in 150 minutes, which gives approximately 44%, answer B.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the calculation again to be sure.\n\nGiven that P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100\u03bb). Therefore, e^(-100\u03bb) = 0.68. Then, taking natural logarithm: -100\u03bb = ln(0.68) \u2248 -0.38566. Therefore, \u03bb \u2248 0.0038566 per minute.\n\nNow, the probability of decay within 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-150\u03bb). Let's compute 150\u03bb: 150 * 0.0038566 \u2248 0.57849. Then, e^(-0.57849) \u2248 e^-0.5 * e^-0.07849 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245 \u2248 0.6065 * 0.9245. Let's compute that:\n\n0.6 * 0.9245 = 0.5547\n\n0.0065 * 0.9245 \u2248 0.0060\n\nSo total \u2248 0.5547 + 0.0060 \u2248 0.5607\n\nTherefore, 1 - 0.5607 \u2248 0.4393, which is approximately 43.93%, so 44%, which is answer B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B, 44%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}"
