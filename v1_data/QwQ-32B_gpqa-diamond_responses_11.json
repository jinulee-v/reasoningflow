        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino in the decay of a pion at rest. The reaction is \u03c0\u207a \u2192 \u03bc\u207a + \u03bd. The rest masses are given: \u03c0\u207a is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and \u03bc\u207a is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. The options are A through D with different values. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. That means the total momentum after the decay must also be zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That's conservation of momentum.\n\nNow, energy conservation: the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_\u03c0 c\u00b2. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each of their energies is their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energy. But wait, actually, the total energy of each particle is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c\u00b2)^2 ). Since they are moving, their energies will be more than their rest masses. But since the neutrino is massless (or at least, we can assume it's massless for this problem, since the problem doesn't give a mass), its energy is just pc. The muon has a mass, so its energy is sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_\u03bc c\u00b2)^2 ). \n\nBut since momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal. Let me denote the magnitude of their momenta as p. So the neutrino's energy is E_\u03bd = pc, and the muon's energy is E_\u03bc = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_\u03bc c\u00b2)^2 ). \n\nThe total energy after decay must equal the rest energy of the pion: E_\u03bc + E_\u03bd = m_\u03c0 c\u00b2.\n\nSo substituting in terms of p:\n\nsqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_\u03bc c\u00b2)^2 ) + p c = m_\u03c0 c\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that equation can be solved for p. Let me write it without the c's for simplicity (since we can work in units where c=1, as the masses are given in MeV which is energy units, so c is factored into the mass-energy equivalence):\n\nsqrt( p\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2 ) + p = m_\u03c0.\n\nLet me denote m_\u03c0 as M and m_\u03bc as m for simplicity. So:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) + p = M.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for p. Let me subtract p from both sides:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) = M - p.\n\nNow square both sides:\n\np\u00b2 + m\u00b2 = (M - p)^2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M p + p\u00b2.\n\nSubtract p\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nm\u00b2 = M\u00b2 - 2 M p.\n\nThen, solving for p:\n\n2 M p = M\u00b2 - m\u00b2\n\np = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M).\n\nOkay, so that gives the magnitude of the momentum. Let me plug in the numbers. M is 139.6 MeV, m is 105.7 MeV.\n\nCalculating numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2. Hmm, that's a difference of squares, so (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9\n\n139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3\n\nMultiply those: 33.9 * 245.3. Let me compute that:\n\n33.9 * 200 = 6,780\n\n33.9 * 45.3 = let's see, 33.9 * 40 = 1,356; 33.9 * 5.3 = 180.67. So total 1,356 + 180.67 = 1,536.67\n\nTotal numerator: 6,780 + 1,536.67 = 8,316.67 MeV\u00b2\n\nThen denominator is 2*M = 2*139.6 = 279.2 MeV\n\nSo p = 8,316.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by, say, 10 to get 831.667 / 27.92 \u2248\n\nWell, 27.92 * 30 = 837.6, which is a bit more than 831.667. So approximately 29.7?\n\nWait, let me do it more accurately:\n\n279.2 * 29.7 \u2248 279.2*30 = 8,376 minus 279.2*0.3 = 83.76, so 8,376 - 83.76 = 8,292.24. Hmm, which is close to 8,316.67. The difference is 8,316.67 - 8,292.24 \u2248 24.43. So 24.43 / 279.2 \u2248 ~0.0875. So total p \u2248 29.7 + 0.0875 \u2248 29.7875 MeV/c. Wait, but actually, since p is in MeV/c? Wait, hold on, units here.\n\nWait, actually, when we set c=1, the units of p would be MeV/c, but since we are working in natural units where c=1, the momentum is in MeV/c. But when we compute p here, the units would actually be (MeV)^2 divided by MeV, so MeV. Wait, maybe I need to check units again.\n\nWait, actually, in the equation p = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M), since M and m are in MeV/c\u00b2, then (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2) would be (MeV/c\u00b2)^2, and dividing by M (MeV/c\u00b2) gives (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 / (MeV/c\u00b2) ) = MeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2? Wait, maybe I confused units here. Hmm, perhaps better to think in terms of natural units where c=1, so mass is in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c. Wait, actually, in natural units (c=1), mass is in MeV, and momentum is in MeV/c. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too confusing. Maybe better to just proceed with the numbers as given, assuming that the units work out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the arithmetic. Let me recalculate the numerator:\n\n(139.6)^2 = let's compute that. 140^2 is 19,600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19,600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19,488.16\n\nSimilarly, (105.7)^2: 100\u00b2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7\u00b2 = 10,000 + 1,140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49\n\nSo the difference is 19,488.16 - 11,172.49 = 8,315.67 MeV\u00b2 (since M and m are in MeV/c\u00b2, so squared would be (MeV/c\u00b2)^2, but when multiplied by c\u00b2, but maybe in natural units, it's okay). Anyway, the numerator is 8,315.67, denominator is 2*139.6 = 279.2.\n\nSo p = 8,315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's do this division:\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8,376 minus 279.2 = 8,376 - 279.2 = 8,096.8\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Let me try 29.7:\n\n279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2*(30 - 0.3) = 279.2*30 - 279.2*0.3 = 8,376 - 83.76 = 8,292.24\n\nDifference between numerator and this is 8,315.67 - 8,292.24 = 23.43\n\nSo 23.43 / 279.2 \u2248 0.0839\n\nSo total p \u2248 29.7 + 0.0839 \u2248 29.7839 MeV/c. Let's say approximately 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nSo p \u2248 29.78 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the muon is its total energy minus its rest energy. The total energy of the muon is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, p is 29.78 MeV/c, so p\u00b2 is (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 (MeV/c)^2. But since in natural units, c=1, so p\u00b2 is 886.8 (MeV)^2? Wait, maybe I need to clarify units again. Hmm, perhaps better to just compute numerically.\n\nWait, actually, in natural units where c=1, the energy of the muon is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2). Since m_\u03bc is 105.7 MeV, so m_\u03bc\u00b2 is (105.7)^2 \u2248 11,172.49 (MeV)^2. The p\u00b2 is (29.78)^2 \u2248 886.8 (MeV)^2. So total energy squared is 11,172.49 + 886.8 \u2248 12,059.29 (MeV)^2. Taking square root gives sqrt(12,059.29) \u2248 109.8 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the total energy of the muon is approximately 109.8 MeV. Its rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 109.8 - 105.7 \u2248 4.1 MeV. Hmm, that's close to option D which has 4.12 MeV for the muon. Let me check the neutrino's energy.\n\nThe neutrino's energy is E_\u03bd = p c, but in natural units, that's just p. Since p \u2248 29.78 MeV/c, so E_\u03bd \u2248 29.78 MeV. Wait, but the total energy of the pion is 139.6 MeV. The muon's energy is 109.8, so the neutrino's energy should be 139.6 - 109.8 \u2248 29.8 MeV. So that would give the neutrino's kinetic energy as 29.8 MeV, since neutrinos are massless (assuming), so their total energy is all kinetic. So the muon has KE ~4.1 MeV and neutrino ~29.8 MeV. That matches option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. Hmm, so that's probably the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be precise.\n\nFirst, let's recalculate p:\n\np = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M)\n\nM = 139.6, m = 105.7\n\nM\u00b2 = 139.6\u00b2 = let's compute exactly:\n\n139.6 * 139.6:\n\nFirst compute 140*140 = 19,600\n\nSubtract 0.4*140 + 0.4*140 - 0.4\u00b2 (Wait, actually, (a - b)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2, so (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140\u00b2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4\u00b2 = 19,600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19,488.16\n\nSimilarly, m\u00b2 = 105.7\u00b2:\n\n105.7 * 105.7:\n\n100\u00b2 = 10,000\n\n2*100*5.7 = 1,140\n\n5.7\u00b2 = 32.49\n\nTotal: 10,000 + 1,140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49\n\nSo M\u00b2 - m\u00b2 = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49 = 8,315.67\n\nDivide by 2*M = 2*139.6 = 279.2\n\nSo p = 8,315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 let's do this division more accurately.\n\n279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8,376 minus 279.2 = 8,376 - 279.2 = 8,096.8\n\nWait, that's 29 gives 8,096.8, which is less than 8,315.67. The difference is 8,315.67 - 8,096.8 = 218.87\n\nSo 218.87 / 279.2 \u2248 0.784. So total p \u2248 29 + 0.784 \u2248 29.784 MeV/c. So that's consistent with before.\n\nSo p \u2248 29.784 MeV/c.\n\nNow, the muon's energy is sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2). Let's compute p\u00b2:\n\n29.784\u00b2: Let's compute 30\u00b2 = 900, subtract (0.216)^2 and 2*30*0.216. Wait, maybe better to compute directly:\n\n29.784 * 29.784:\n\nFirst, 29 * 29 = 841\n\n29 * 0.784 = 22.736\n\n0.784 * 29 = 22.736\n\n0.784 * 0.784 \u2248 0.614\n\nWait, perhaps better to do (30 - 0.216)^2 = 30\u00b2 - 2*30*0.216 + 0.216\u00b2 = 900 - 12.96 + 0.046 = 900 - 12.96 is 887.04 + 0.046 \u2248 887.086\n\nSo p\u00b2 \u2248 887.086 (MeV/c)^2. But in natural units, c=1, so p\u00b2 is 887.086 (MeV)^2. Then adding m_\u03bc\u00b2 = 11,172.49 (MeV)^2 gives total energy squared:\n\n887.086 + 11,172.49 \u2248 12,059.576 (MeV)^2\n\nTaking square root: sqrt(12,059.576). Let's see, 110\u00b2 = 12,100, so sqrt(12,059.576) is a bit less than 110. Let's compute 109.8\u00b2 = (110 - 0.2)^2 = 110\u00b2 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.2\u00b2 = 12,100 - 44 + 0.04 = 12,056.04\n\nHmm, 109.8\u00b2 = 12,056.04, which is less than 12,059.576. The difference is 12,059.576 - 12,056.04 = 3.536. So each additional 0.1 in the sqrt adds roughly 2*109.8*0.1 + 0.1\u00b2 \u2248 21.96 + 0.01 \u2248 21.97. So to get an extra 3.536, need about 3.536 / 21.97 \u2248 0.16. So sqrt \u2248 109.8 + 0.16 \u2248 109.96 MeV. So approximately 109.96 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the muon's total energy is ~109.96 MeV. Subtract its rest mass energy (105.7 MeV) gives KE_\u03bc \u2248 109.96 - 105.7 \u2248 4.26 MeV. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous estimate. Wait, maybe my approximation was off. Let me do a better calculation.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(12,059.576):\n\nLet me note that 109.8^2 = 12,056.04\n\n109.9^2 = (109.8 + 0.1)^2 = 109.8\u00b2 + 2*109.8*0.1 + 0.1\u00b2 = 12,056.04 + 21.96 + 0.01 = 12,078.01\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, 109.8 + 0.1 is 109.9, so squared is 109.8\u00b2 + 2*109.8*0.1 + 0.1\u00b2. Wait, 109.8\u00b2 is 12,056.04, plus 21.96 gives 12,078.0, plus 0.01 is 12,078.01. But our target is 12,059.576, which is between 109.8\u00b2 and 109.9\u00b2. Wait, actually, 109.8\u00b2 is 12,056.04, which is less than 12,059.576. The difference is 12,059.576 - 12,056.04 = 3.536. So how much more than 109.8 do we need?\n\nLet me denote x = 109.8 + \u03b4, so that (109.8 + \u03b4)^2 = 12,059.576\n\nExpanding:\n\n109.8\u00b2 + 2*109.8*\u03b4 + \u03b4\u00b2 = 12,059.576\n\nWe know 109.8\u00b2 = 12,056.04, so:\n\n12,056.04 + 219.6 \u03b4 + \u03b4\u00b2 = 12,059.576\n\nSubtract 12,056.04:\n\n219.6 \u03b4 + \u03b4\u00b2 = 3.536\n\nAssuming \u03b4 is small, \u03b4\u00b2 is negligible, so:\n\n219.6 \u03b4 \u2248 3.536 \u2192 \u03b4 \u2248 3.536 / 219.6 \u2248 0.0161\n\nSo total sqrt \u2248 109.8 + 0.0161 \u2248 109.816 MeV. So approximately 109.82 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the muon's total energy is ~109.82 MeV. Subtract rest mass 105.7 gives KE_\u03bc \u2248 109.82 - 105.7 = 4.12 MeV. That's exactly option D's first value. \n\nThen the neutrino's energy is total energy of pion minus muon's energy: 139.6 - 109.82 \u2248 29.78 MeV. Since neutrinos are massless, their kinetic energy is equal to their total energy, so KE_\u03bd \u2248 29.78 MeV, which rounds to 29.8 MeV. So that's exactly option D: 4.12 and 29.8.\n\nWait, but let me check if the neutrino's energy is indeed p*c. Since in natural units, E_\u03bd = p. Since p was calculated as ~29.78 MeV/c, then E_\u03bd is 29.78 MeV, which matches the subtraction. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Let me check the other options to see if any others are close. Option A has 3.52 and 20.8, which are lower. Option B has 2.84 and 26.8, which are even lower. Option C is higher. So D is the correct one.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way someone might approach this problem and get a different answer. For instance, maybe using kinetic energy directly?\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the formula for decay products when one is massless. The kinetic energy of the heavier particle (muon here) can be found by:\n\nKE_\u03bc = ( (M - m)^2 - m^2 ) / (2 M )\n\nWait, let me see. Let me think of the general formula.\n\nAlternatively, the kinetic energy of the muon is (E_\u03bc - m_\u03bc c\u00b2). Since E_\u03bc = sqrt( p\u00b2 c^4 + m_\u03bc\u00b2 c^4 ) = c\u00b2 sqrt( p\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2 ). So KE_\u03bc = c\u00b2 ( sqrt(p\u00b2 + m_\u03bc\u00b2 ) - m_\u03bc ). \n\nWe already found p = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M ), so substituting that in:\n\nKE_\u03bc = c\u00b2 [ sqrt( ( (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M ) )\u00b2 + m\u00b2 ) - m ]\n\nLet me compute that expression symbolically first.\n\nLet me factor out 1/(2M)^2 inside the sqrt:\n\nsqrt( [ (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)^2 + (2 M m)^2 ] / (2 M)^2 )\n\nWait, let me compute the terms inside the sqrt:\n\np\u00b2 + m\u00b2 = [ (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)^2 / (4 M\u00b2) ) ] + m\u00b2\n\n= [ (M^4 - 2 M\u00b2 m\u00b2 + m^4) / (4 M\u00b2) ) ] + m\u00b2\n\n= (M^4 - 2 M\u00b2 m\u00b2 + m^4 + 4 M\u00b2 m\u00b2 ) / (4 M\u00b2 )\n\n= (M^4 + 2 M\u00b2 m\u00b2 + m^4 ) / (4 M\u00b2 )\n\n= (M\u00b2 + m\u00b2)^2 / (4 M\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) = (M\u00b2 + m\u00b2)/(2 M )\n\nTherefore, KE_\u03bc = c\u00b2 [ (M\u00b2 + m\u00b2)/(2 M ) - m ]\n\n= c\u00b2 [ (M\u00b2 + m\u00b2 - 2 M m ) / (2 M ) ]\n\n= c\u00b2 [ (M - m)^2 / (2 M ) ]\n\nSo KE_\u03bc = ( (M - m)^2 ) / (2 M ) * c\u00b2\n\nWait, but since M and m are already in units of MeV/c\u00b2, then (M - m)^2 is (MeV/c\u00b2)^2, divided by 2 M (MeV/c\u00b2), so the units become (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 / (MeV/c\u00b2) ) = MeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = MeV. So that works.\n\nTherefore, KE_\u03bc = ( (M - m)^2 ) / (2 M )\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\nM = 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2, m = 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2\n\n(M - m) = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nSo (M - m)^2 = (33.9)^2 = 1,149.21 (MeV/c\u00b2)^2\n\nDivide by 2*M = 2*139.6 = 279.2 MeV/c\u00b2\n\nThus KE_\u03bc = 1,149.21 / 279.2 \u2248 let's compute that.\n\n279.2 * 4 = 1,116.8\n\nSubtract that from 1,149.21: 1,149.21 - 1,116.8 = 32.41\n\nSo 32.41 / 279.2 \u2248 0.116\n\nThus total KE_\u03bc \u2248 4 + 0.116 \u2248 4.116 MeV, which is 4.12 MeV. Exactly as before. So that's a better way, perhaps.\n\nSimilarly, the neutrino's energy is E_\u03bd = M - E_\u03bc = M - [ sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) ]\n\nBut sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2) = (M\u00b2 + m\u00b2)/(2 M )\n\nTherefore, E_\u03bd = M - (M\u00b2 + m\u00b2)/(2 M ) = (2 M\u00b2 - M\u00b2 - m\u00b2 ) / (2 M ) = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M )\n\nWait, but that's equal to p. Since p = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M ), so E_\u03bd = p c, which is consistent with earlier.\n\nTherefore, the neutrino's energy is (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M ) * c\u00b2, which in units is (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M ). Since M and m are in MeV/c\u00b2, so (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2) is (MeV/c\u00b2)^2, divided by 2 M (MeV/c\u00b2) gives (MeV/c\u00b2)^2 / (MeV/c\u00b2) ) = MeV/c\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = MeV. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, KE_\u03bd = E_\u03bd = (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M )\n\nPlugging in numbers:\n\n( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) / (2 * 139.6 )\n\nWe already calculated numerator as 8,315.67, so 8,315.67 / 279.2 \u2248 29.78 MeV, which is 29.8 MeV. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.\n\nI think that's solid. The key was realizing that the momentum is (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M ), then computing the kinetic energy of the muon via KE = ( (M - m)^2 )/(2 M ), which gives exactly the first value in D. The neutrino's energy is the remaining, which is (M\u00b2 - m\u00b2)/(2 M ), giving the second value. So D is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{D}\n</think>\n\nTo find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino in the decay of a stationary pion (\u03c0\u207a \u2192 \u03bc\u207a + \u03bd), we use conservation of energy and momentum. \n\n1. **Conservation of Momentum**: Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Therefore, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite.\n   \n2. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before decay (rest energy of the pion) must equal the total energy after decay (sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino).\n\nThe rest mass of the pion (M) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and the rest mass of the muon (m) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Momentum Calculation**:\n   The momentum \\( p \\) of each particle is given by:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{M^2 - m^2}{2M}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}\n   \\]\n   Calculating the numerator:\n   \\[\n   (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) = 33.9 \\times 245.3 = 8315.67 \\, \\text{MeV}^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV/c}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Kinetic Energy of the Muon**:\n   The kinetic energy (KE) of the muon is calculated using:\n   \\[\n   KE_{\\mu} = \\frac{(M - m)^2}{2M}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   KE_{\\mu} = \\frac{(139.6 - 105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{(33.9)^2}{279.2} \\approx \\frac{1149.21}{279.2} \\approx 4.12 \\, \\text{MeV}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Energy of the Neutrino**:\n   The energy of the neutrino (which is its kinetic energy since it is massless) is:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\nu} = \\frac{M^2 - m^2}{2M}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}\n   \\]\n   Rounding to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV respectively.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]"

Therefore, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite.\n   \n2. **Conservation of Energy**: The total energy before decay (rest energy of the pion) must equal the total energy after decay (sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino).\n\nThe rest mass of the pion (M) is 139.6 MeV/c\u00b2 and the rest mass of the muon (m) is 105.7 MeV/c\u00b2. \n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Momentum Calculation**:\n   The momentum \\( p \\) of each particle is given by:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{M^2 - m^2}{2M}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given values:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{(139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6}\n   \\]\n   Calculating the numerator:\n   \\[\n   (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - 105.7)(139.6 + 105.7) = 33.9 \\times 245.3 = 8315.67 \\, \\text{MeV}^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV/c}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Kinetic Energy of the Muon**:\n   The kinetic energy (KE) of the muon is calculated using:\n   \\[\n   KE_{\\mu} = \\frac{(M - m)^2}{2M}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   KE_{\\mu} = \\frac{(139.6 - 105.7)^2}{2 \\times 139.6} = \\frac{(33.9)^2}{279.2} \\approx \\frac{1149.21}{279.2} \\approx 4.12 \\, \\text{MeV}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Energy of the Neutrino**:\n   The energy of the neutrino (which is its kinetic energy since it is massless) is:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\nu} = \\frac{M^2 - m^2}{2M}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   E_{\\nu} = \\frac{8315.67}{279.2} \\approx 29.78 \\, \\text{MeV}\n   \\]\n   Rounding to one decimal place gives 29.8 MeV.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV respectively.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]",
