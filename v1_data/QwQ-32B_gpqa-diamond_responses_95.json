        "response": "Okay, so I need to find the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size and distance. Hmm, let me recall the formula for the entropy of a black hole. I think it's related to the area of the event horizon. The entropy S is proportional to the area A divided by the Planck area, right? The exact formula might be S = (k_B * A) / (4 * l_P^2), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant and l_P is the Planck length. But I should check the exact constants to make sure.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given values. The distance to the black hole is d = 10^10 parsecs, and the angular size \u03b8 is 10^-17 degrees. Wait, angular size is usually given in radians when doing calculations, so I might need to convert that. Also, the angular size of the event horizon would be related to its actual size and the distance. The formula for angular size is \u03b8 \u2248 (r / d), where r is the radius of the event horizon, but that's in radians. Since \u03b8 is given in degrees, I need to convert it to radians first.\n\nLet me start by converting \u03b8 from degrees to radians. Since 1 degree is \u03c0/180 radians, so \u03b8 in radians is 10^-17 degrees * (\u03c0 / 180). Let me compute that:\n\n\u03b8_rad = 10^-17 * \u03c0 / 180 \u2248 10^-17 * 0.0174533 \u2248 1.74533 \u00d7 10^-19 radians.\n\nWait, actually, \u03c0/180 is approximately 0.0174533 radians per degree, so multiplying by 10^-17 degrees gives 0.0174533 \u00d7 10^-17 \u2248 1.745 \u00d7 10^-19 radians. Okay, so \u03b8 \u2248 1.7 \u00d7 10^-19 radians.\n\nNow, the angular size \u03b8 is approximately equal to the radius of the event horizon divided by the distance to the black hole, right? So \u03b8 \u2248 r / d. Therefore, solving for r gives r \u2248 \u03b8 * d.\n\nBut wait, actually, the angular diameter would be 2r / d, so maybe \u03b8 is the angular diameter? The question says \"angular size of the event horizon\", which is probably the angular diameter. So maybe \u03b8 = 2r / d. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, angular diameter is usually defined as the angle subtended by the diameter, so \u03b8 = 2r / d. Therefore, solving for r gives r = (\u03b8 * d) / 2.\n\nSo let me compute r first. The distance d is given as 10^10 parsecs. I need to convert that to meters to work with SI units. Let me recall that 1 parsec is approximately 3.08567758 \u00d7 10^16 meters. So:\n\nd = 10^10 parsecs = 10^10 * 3.08567758 \u00d7 10^16 m \u2248 3.08567758 \u00d7 10^26 meters.\n\nHmm, that's a huge distance. Let me write that as approximately 3 \u00d7 10^26 meters for estimation purposes.\n\nNow, plugging into r = (\u03b8 * d)/2:\n\nr = (1.745 \u00d7 10^-19 radians) * (3 \u00d7 10^26 m) / 2 \u2248 (5.235 \u00d7 10^7 m) / 2 \u2248 2.6175 \u00d7 10^7 meters.\n\nWait, that's about 26 million meters, which is 26,000 kilometers. That seems reasonable for a supermassive black hole's event horizon radius? Let me check. The Schwarzschild radius is r_s = 2GM/c\u00b2. For a black hole with mass M, so if I can find the mass, maybe I can cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can proceed with the entropy formula. The entropy of a black hole is given by S = (k_B * A) / (4 l_P\u00b2), where A is the surface area of the event horizon. The area A is 4\u03c0r\u00b2. So substituting that in:\n\nS = (k_B * 4\u03c0r\u00b2) / (4 l_P\u00b2) = (\u03c0 k_B r\u00b2) / l_P\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me confirm the exact formula. I think the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (k_B A)/(4 l_P\u00b2). Since A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, so S = (k_B * 4\u03c0r\u00b2)/(4 l_P\u00b2) = (\u03c0 k_B r\u00b2)/l_P\u00b2. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo I need to compute that. Let me note down the constants:\n\nk_B (Boltzmann constant) \u2248 1.38 \u00d7 10^-23 J/K,\n\nl_P (Planck length) \u2248 1.616 \u00d7 10^-35 meters,\n\n\u03c0 is just pi, approximately 3.1416.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nFirst, compute r\u00b2. The radius r we found was approximately 2.6175 \u00d7 10^7 meters. Squaring that:\n\nr\u00b2 \u2248 (2.6175 \u00d7 10^7)^2 \u2248 (2.6175)^2 \u00d7 10^14 \u2248 6.85 \u00d7 10^14 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute that more accurately:\n\n2.6175 squared is approximately 2.6175 * 2.6175. Let's see:\n\n2 * 2.6175 = 5.235,\n\n0.6175 * 2.6175 \u2248 approx 1.6175*2.6175? Wait, maybe better to do 2.6175^2:\n\n(2 + 0.6175)^2 = 4 + 2*2*0.6175 + 0.6175\u00b2 = 4 + 2.47 + 0.381 \u2248 4 + 2.47 is 6.47 + 0.381 is ~6.85. So yes, 6.85 \u00d7 10^14 m\u00b2.\n\nThen, \u03c0 * k_B * r\u00b2 \u2248 3.1416 * 1.38e-23 J/K * 6.85e14 m\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst multiply 3.1416 * 1.38 \u2248 4.335,\n\nThen 4.335 * 6.85 \u2248 let's see, 4 * 6.85 = 27.4, 0.335 * 6.85 \u2248 2.29475, so total \u2248 27.4 + 2.29475 \u2248 29.69475.\n\nSo that gives 29.69475 \u00d7 10^(-23 +14) J/K = 29.69475 \u00d7 10^-9 J/K.\n\nWait, hold on, the exponents: 10^-23 (from k_B) multiplied by 10^14 (from r\u00b2) gives 10^-9. So yes, so that term is ~29.7 \u00d7 10^-9 J/K.\n\nThen, the denominator is l_P squared, which is (1.616e-35 m)^2 \u2248 (2.611e-70 m\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me compute l_P squared:\n\n(1.616 \u00d7 10^-35)^2 = (1.616)^2 \u00d7 10^-70 \u2248 2.611 \u00d7 10^-70 m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the entire entropy S is:\n\nS = (\u03c0 k_B r\u00b2) / l_P\u00b2 \u2248 (29.7 \u00d7 10^-9 J/K) / (2.611 \u00d7 10^-70 m\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, hold on, units? Wait, actually, the units of k_B is J/(K), and the area is m\u00b2, so the numerator has units of J/K * m\u00b2? Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula is S = (k_B * A) / (4 l_P\u00b2). Since A is in m\u00b2, then the units would be (J/K * m\u00b2) / (m\u00b2) ) = J/K. So units are okay.\n\nWait, but in my calculation above, I had:\n\n\u03c0 * k_B * r\u00b2 / l_P\u00b2. Wait, but actually, the formula is (k_B * A)/(4 l_P\u00b2). Since A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, so substituting gives (k_B * 4\u03c0r\u00b2)/(4 l_P\u00b2) = (\u03c0 k_B r\u00b2)/l_P\u00b2. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is \u03c0 * k_B * r\u00b2, which has units of (J/K) * m\u00b2, and the denominator is l_P\u00b2 (m\u00b2), so the m\u00b2 cancels, leaving J/K. So that's okay.\n\nSo proceeding with the numbers:\n\nNumerator: ~29.7 \u00d7 10^-9 J/K,\n\nDenominator: ~2.611 \u00d7 10^-70 m\u00b2,\n\nWait, but actually, the denominator is l_P squared, which is in m\u00b2, so when we divide, the m\u00b2 cancels, so the units are correct. The numerical value is (29.7e-9) / (2.611e-70) J/K.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n29.7 / 2.611 \u2248 11.37,\n\nand 10^-9 / 10^-70 = 10^61,\n\nso total is approximately 11.37 \u00d7 10^61 J/K \u2248 1.137 \u00d7 10^62 J/K.\n\nHmm, so that would be approximately 10^62 J/K, which is option B. But let me check my calculations again because I might have messed up some exponents.\n\nWait, let me go step by step again.\n\nFirst, compute r:\n\n\u03b8 = 10^-17 degrees converted to radians: 10^-17 * \u03c0/180 \u2248 1.745e-19 radians.\n\nDistance d = 10^10 parsecs. 1 parsec is ~3.086e16 meters, so d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.\n\nThen, angular diameter \u03b8 = 2r/d => r = (\u03b8*d)/2 = (1.745e-19 * 3.086e26)/2.\n\nCalculating numerator: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = 1.745 * 3.086 * 1e7 \u2248 5.39 * 1e7 = 5.39e7.\n\nDivide by 2: 5.39e7 / 2 \u2248 2.695e7 meters. So r \u2248 2.7e7 meters. Okay, that's consistent with before.\n\nThen, area A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2. Let's compute r squared:\n\n(2.7e7)^2 = 7.29e14 m\u00b2.\n\nThus, A = 4 * \u03c0 * 7.29e14 \u2248 4 * 3.1416 * 7.29e14 \u2248 12.566 * 7.29e14 \u2248 91.5e14 m\u00b2 \u2248 9.15e15 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, hold on, 4 * 3.1416 is about 12.566, multiplied by 7.29e14:\n\n12.566 * 7.29 = let's compute 12 * 7.29 = 87.48, 0.566 *7.29 \u2248 4.12, so total \u2248 87.48 +4.12 \u2248 91.6, so 91.6e14 m\u00b2 = 9.16e15 m\u00b2. Okay.\n\nThen, entropy S = (k_B * A)/(4 l_P\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me use the formula correctly now. Let me recast all steps with the correct formula.\n\nS = (k_B * A) / (4 l_P\u00b2)\n\nA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, so substituting:\n\nS = (k_B * 4\u03c0r\u00b2) / (4 l_P\u00b2) = (\u03c0 k_B r\u00b2)/ l_P\u00b2. So same as before.\n\nBut let's compute with the numbers again.\n\nk_B = 1.38e-23 J/K,\n\nr\u00b2 = (2.7e7)^2 = 7.29e14 m\u00b2,\n\n\u03c0 * k_B * r\u00b2 = 3.1416 * 1.38e-23 * 7.29e14.\n\nFirst multiply 3.1416 * 1.38 \u2248 4.335,\n\nthen 4.335 * 7.29 \u2248 31.66,\n\nso 31.66e( -23 +14 ) = 31.66e-9 J/K,\n\nthen divide by l_P squared: l_P\u00b2 = (1.616e-35)^2 \u2248 2.61e-70 m\u00b2,\n\nso S = 31.66e-9 / 2.61e-70 \u2248 (31.66 / 2.61) * 10^( -9 +70 ) \u2248 12.13 * 10^61 \u2248 1.213e62 J/K.\n\nSo that's about 10^62 J/K, which is option B. Hmm, so that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any miscalculations in exponents.\n\nWait, when I did 3.1416 * 1.38e-23 * 7.29e14,\n\nthe exponents: 10^-23 * 10^14 = 10^-9,\n\nso the coefficient is 3.1416 * 1.38 * 7.29 \u2248 3.1416 * (1.38 *7.29).\n\nCompute 1.38 *7.29 first:\n\n1.38 *7 = 9.66,\n\n1.38 *0.29 \u2248 0.4002,\n\nso total \u2248 9.66 +0.4002 \u2248 10.06,\n\nthen 3.1416 *10.06 \u2248 31.6, so that's correct.\n\nThen 31.6e-9 divided by 2.61e-70:\n\n31.6 / 2.61 \u2248 12.1,\n\nand 10^-9 /10^-70 = 10^61,\n\nso 12.1e61 = 1.21e62, so yes, 10^62 is the order of magnitude. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let me check if I converted parsecs correctly. 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so 10^10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using a different approximation for the constants? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the formula for entropy is written as S = A/(4 l_P\u00b2) in natural units where k_B =1, but in SI units, it's (k_B A)/(4 l_P\u00b2). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the angular size formula? Let me check that again.\n\nThe angular diameter \u03b8 (in radians) is approximately equal to the diameter divided by the distance, so \u03b8 \u2248 (2r)/d. So solving for r gives r = (\u03b8 d)/2. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the question had given the angular radius instead of diameter, but it says angular size, which is usually the angle subtended, so diameter. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using a different value for the Planck length? Let me check Planck length value.\n\nPlanck length l_P = sqrt(\u0127 G / c^3). The exact value is approximately 1.616255(18)\u00d710^\u221235 meters. So my value is okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use more precise numbers?\n\nLet me try with more precise numbers step by step.\n\nFirst, \u03b8 in degrees: 10^-17 degrees.\n\nConvert to radians: \u03b8_rad = 10^-17 * \u03c0 / 180.\n\nCompute \u03c0 / 180 \u2248 0.0174532925 radians per degree.\n\nThus, \u03b8_rad = 10^-17 * 0.0174532925 \u2248 1.74532925 \u00d7 10^-19 radians.\n\nDistance d = 10^10 parsecs.\n\n1 parsec = 3.08567758149137e16 meters (exact value from IAU 2015).\n\nThus, d = 1e10 * 3.08567758149137e16 = 3.08567758149137e26 meters.\n\nCompute r = (\u03b8_rad * d)/2:\n\nr = (1.74532925e-19 * 3.08567758e26)/2.\n\nFirst multiply 1.74532925e-19 * 3.08567758e26:\n\n1.74532925 * 3.08567758 \u2248 let's compute:\n\n1.7453 * 3.0857 \u2248\n\n1.7 * 3.0857 = 5.2457,\n\n0.0453 * 3.0857 \u2248 0.1403,\n\nTotal \u2248 5.2457 + 0.1403 \u2248 5.386,\n\nSo approximately 5.386e7 (since 1e-19 *1e26 = 1e7).\n\nThus, 5.386e7 divided by 2 is 2.693e7 meters. So r \u2248 2.693e7 meters.\n\nThen, area A = 4\u03c0r\u00b2:\n\nr\u00b2 = (2.693e7)^2 = (2.693)^2 * 1e14.\n\n2.693 squared: 2.693 * 2.693:\n\n2*2 =4,\n\n2*0.693 =1.386,\n\n0.693*2 =1.386,\n\n0.693^2\u22480.480,\n\nSo (2 +0.693)^2 = 2\u00b2 + 2*2*0.693 +0.693\u00b2 =4 + 2.772 +0.480\u22487.252,\n\nWait, actually, (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 where a=2, b=0.693,\n\nso 4 + 2*(2)(0.693) + (0.693)^2 = 4 + 2.772 + 0.480 \u2248 7.252,\n\nso 2.693 squared is approximately 7.252, so r\u00b2 \u22487.252e14 m\u00b2,\n\nThus, A =4\u03c0 *7.252e14 \u22484 *3.1416 *7.252e14 \u224812.566 *7.252e14 \u2248\n\n12 *7.252e14 =87.024e14,\n\n0.566 *7.252e14\u22484.103e14,\n\nTotal \u224887.024e14 +4.103e14\u224891.127e14 m\u00b2 \u22489.1127e15 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, compute S = (k_B * A)/(4 l_P\u00b2).\n\nWait, let's use the formula S = (k_B * A)/(4 l_P\u00b2).\n\nk_B =1.380649e-23 J/K (exact value as per SI units),\n\nl_P = sqrt(\u0127 G / c^3). Let me compute l_P squared:\n\nl_P\u00b2 = (\u0127 G / c^3). Let me recall the constants:\n\n\u0127 (Planck constant over 2\u03c0) \u22481.054571817e-34 J\u00b7s,\n\nG (gravitational constant) \u22486.67430e-11 m\u00b3/(kg\u00b7s\u00b2),\n\nc (speed of light) \u2248299792458 m/s.\n\nThus,\n\nl_P\u00b2 = (1.054571817e-34 * 6.67430e-11) / (299792458)^3.\n\nFirst compute numerator:\n\n1.054571817e-34 *6.67430e-11 \u2248\n\n1.05457 *6.6743 \u22487.035,\n\nso 7.035e-45,\n\nDenominator: (3e8)^3 =27e24, but precise:\n\n299792458^3 \u2248 (3e8)^3 =2.7e26, but let's compute more accurately:\n\n299792458 \u22483e8, so (3e8)^3 =27e24 =2.7e25? Wait, 3^3=27, (1e8)^3=1e24, so 27e24 =2.7e25? Wait, no, 27e24 is 2.7e25? Wait, 27e24 is 2.7 \u00d710^25? Wait, 27 is 2.7\u00d710^1, so 27e24 =2.7\u00d710^1 \u00d710^24 =2.7\u00d710^25. Yes.\n\nThus, denominator \u22482.7e25 m^6/(kg\u00b7s\u00b2\u00b7s\u00b2?) Wait, actually, units might be getting complicated, but since we are just calculating the numerical value for l_P squared:\n\nl_P\u00b2 \u2248 (7.035e-45) / (2.7e25) \u2248 (7.035 /2.7) \u00d710^(-45-25) \u22482.605 \u00d710^-70 m\u00b2.\n\nSo l_P\u00b2 \u22482.605e-70 m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, plugging back into S:\n\nS = (1.380649e-23 J/K * 9.1127e15 m\u00b2) / (4 * 2.605e-70 m\u00b2).\n\nFirst compute numerator:\n\n1.380649e-23 *9.1127e15 \u22481.380649 *9.1127 \u224812.57,\n\nso 12.57e(-23+15)=12.57e-8 J/K\u00b7m\u00b2,\n\nWait, but actually, the units are (J/K)*(m\u00b2) divided by (m\u00b2), so units are J/K.\n\nWait, let me compute the numbers step by step:\n\nNumerator: 1.380649e-23 *9.1127e15 = (1.380649 *9.1127) *10^(-23+15)= (12.57) *10^-8 \u22481.257e-7 J/K.\n\nDenominator: 4 *2.605e-70 \u224810.42e-70 \u22481.042e-69 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, so S = (1.257e-7 J/K) / (1.042e-69 m\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, no, wait, the denominator is 4*l_P\u00b2, which is 4*2.605e-70 =1.042e-69 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the numerator is (k_B * A) which is (J/K * m\u00b2). So when divided by (m\u00b2), the m\u00b2 cancels, so units are J/K.\n\nSo the numerical value is (1.257e-7) / (1.042e-69) \u2248 (1.257 /1.042) *10^(-7 +69) \u22481.206 *10^62 \u22481.2e62 J/K.\n\nSo that's about 10^62 J/K, so the answer is B.\n\nHmm, so that seems consistent. Let me check once more if I messed up any exponents.\n\nWait, in the numerator: 1.38e-23 *9.1e15 = 1.38*9.1 ~12.5, and exponents: -23 +15 = -8, so 12.5e-8, which is 1.25e-7.\n\nDenominator: 4 *2.6e-70 = ~10.4e-70, which is 1.04e-69.\n\nSo 1.25e-7 divided by 1.04e-69 is (1.25 /1.04) *10^( -7 +69 ) \u22481.2 *10^62. Yep.\n\nTherefore, the entropy is approximately 10^62 J/K, so the answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check if the question says \"order of magnitude\", so maybe even if it's 1.2e62, the order is 10^62, so B is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the angular size formula? Let me think again.\n\nSuppose someone thought that angular size is just r/d instead of 2r/d. Then r would be half of what I calculated, so r = (\u03b8*d)/2, but if they thought \u03b8 = r/d, then r = \u03b8*d, which would be double the radius. Let me see what happens in that case.\n\nIf someone incorrectly uses \u03b8 = r/d, then r = \u03b8*d =1.745e-19 *3.086e26 \u22485.39e7 meters, so double the previous value. Then r would be ~5.4e7 m, so r squared would be ~3e15 m\u00b2, leading to area ~4\u03c0*3e15\u22483.8e16 m\u00b2. Then S would be (1.38e-23 *3.8e16)/(4*2.6e-70) \u2248 (5.24e-7)/(1e-69)\u22485e62, which is still ~10^63? Wait, no, 5e62 is still order 10^62. Wait, 5e62 is 5\u00d710^62, so order of magnitude is still 10^62. So even if that mistake was made, the order of magnitude remains the same. So the answer is still B.\n\nAlternatively, if someone messed up the exponent in the distance. Let me see, the distance is 10^10 parsecs. If someone thought 10^10 light years instead of parsecs, but 1 parsec is about 3.26 light years, so 10^10 parsecs is ~3.26e10 light years. But the question says parsecs, so probably not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the exponent in the Planck length? Let me check Planck length again.\n\nPlanck length is sqrt( \u0127 G / c^3 ). Let me compute the exponent:\n\n\u0127 is ~1e-34 J\u00b7s,\n\nG is ~1e-11 m\u00b3/(kg\u00b7s\u00b2),\n\nc is ~1e8 m/s,\n\nso numerator: 1e-34 *1e-11 =1e-45,\n\ndenominator: (1e8)^3 =1e24,\n\nso l_P\u00b2 ~ (1e-45)/(1e24)=1e-69 m\u00b2,\n\nso l_P ~1e-34.5 m? Wait, sqrt(1e-69)=1e-34.5, so ~1e-35 m, which matches the known value. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects using the Schwarzschild radius formula and then calculating mass, then entropy via S = (k_B A)/(4 l_P\u00b2). But that would be the same as what I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in natural units where c=G=\u0127=k_B=1, but the answer is in J/K, so SI units are needed. So no, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the area? Let me check again:\n\nr =2.69e7 m,\n\nr squared is (2.69e7)^2 = (2.69)^2 *1e14,\n\n2.69 squared is approx 7.236,\n\nso 7.236e14 m\u00b2,\n\ntimes 4 pi gives 4 *3.1416 *7.236e14 \u2248 91e14 m\u00b2, which is 9.1e15 m\u00b2. Correct.\n\nSo all steps check out. Therefore, the answer should be B, 10^62 J/K.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}\n</think>\n\nGiven the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole, \u03b8 = 10\u207b\u00b9\u2077 degrees, and the distance to the black hole, d = 10\u00b9\u2070 parsecs, we need to find the order of magnitude of its entropy.\n\n1. **Convert angular size to radians**:\n   \\[\n   \\theta_{\\text{rad}} = 10^{-17} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\approx 1.745 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ radians}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert distance to meters**:\n   \\[\n   d = 10^{10} \\text{ parsecs} \\times 3.08567758 \\times 10^{16} \\text{ m/parsec} \\approx 3.086 \\times 10^{26} \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the radius of the event horizon**:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{\\theta_{\\text{rad}} \\times d}{2} = \\frac{1.745 \\times 10^{-19} \\times 3.086 \\times 10^{26}}{2} \\approx 2.69 \\times 10^7 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the surface area of the event horizon**:\n   \\[\n   A = 4\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi (2.69 \\times 10^7)^2 \\approx 4\\pi \\times 7.24 \\times 10^{14} \\approx 9.11 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ m}^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula**:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{k_B A}{4 l_P^2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( k_B = 1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K} \\) and \\( l_P = 1.616 \\times 10^{-35} \\text{ m} \\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Planck length squared**:\n   \\[\n   l_P^2 \\approx (1.616 \\times 10^{-35})^2 \\approx 2.61 \\times 10^{-70} \\text{ m}^2\n   \\]\n\n7. **Substitute values into the entropy formula**:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 9.11 \\times 10^{15}}{4 \\times 2.61 \\times 10^{-70}} \\approx \\frac{1.257 \\times 10^{-7}}{1.044 \\times 10^{-69}} \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{62} \\text{ J/K}\n   \\]\n\nThe order of magnitude of the entropy is \\( 10^{62} \\text{ J/K} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]"

Let's compute r squared:\n\n(2.7e7)^2 = 7.29e14 m\u00b2.\n\nThus, A = 4 * \u03c0 * 7.29e14 \u2248 4 * 3.1416 * 7.29e14 \u2248 12.566 * 7.29e14 \u2248 91.5e14 m\u00b2 \u2248 9.15e15 m\u00b2.\n\nWait, hold on, 4 * 3.1416 is about 12.566, multiplied by 7.29e14:\n\n12.566 * 7.29 = let's compute 12 * 7.29 = 87.48, 0.566 *7.29 \u2248 4.12, so total \u2248 87.48 +4.12 \u2248 91.6, so 91.6e14 m\u00b2 = 9.16e15 m\u00b2.

Let me recast all steps with the correct formula.\n\nS = (k_B * A) / (4 l_P\u00b2)\n\nA = 4\u03c0r\u00b2, so substituting:\n\nS = (k_B * 4\u03c0r\u00b2) / (4 l_P\u00b2) = (\u03c0 k_B r\u00b2)/ l_P\u00b2.

Yes.\n\nThus, denominator \u22482.7e25 m^6/(kg\u00b7s\u00b2\u00b7s\u00b2?)

So when divided by (m\u00b2), the m\u00b2 cancels, so units are J/K.\n\nSo the numerical value is (1.257e-7) / (1.042e-69) \u2248 (1.257 /1.042) *10^(-7 +69) \u22481.206 *10^62 \u22481.2e62 J/K.\n\nSo that's about 10^62 J/K, so the answer is B.\n\n",
