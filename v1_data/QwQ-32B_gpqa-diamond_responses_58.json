        "question": "Determine the pH of the solution of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.\nA. 8.92\nB. 8.68\nC. 12.62\nD. 1.38",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the pH of this solution that's made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are given, but I should work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when mixing acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they will react completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't react completely with the base, but maybe some of it will be neutralized? Hmm, I need to think carefully.\n\nLet me start by calculating the moles of each component. Moles are concentration multiplied by volume, but I have to make sure the volumes are in liters. Let me convert all the volumes to liters first:\n\n- 500 mL = 0.5 L\n- 400 mL = 0.4 L\n- 300 mL = 0.3 L\n\nNow, calculate moles:\n\nFor CH3COOH (acetic acid):\nMoles = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles\n\nFor HCl:\nMoles = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles\n\nFor Ba(OH)2:\nBa(OH)2 is a strong base, and each formula unit provides 2 OH- ions. So, moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.\n\nWait, actually, when calculating neutralization, maybe I should consider the H+ and OH- ions. Let me think again.\n\nHCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-. So moles of H+ from HCl = 0.08 moles.\n\nAcetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. However, when mixed with a strong base, the base will neutralize some of the H+ from the acetic acid. But since the base is also reacting with the strong acid first, maybe I should handle the strong acid and strong base first?\n\nYes, that's right. The strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will neutralize each other first. The weak acid (acetic acid) will only come into play if there's excess base or acid left after that.\n\nSo let's first calculate the H+ from HCl and OH- from Ba(OH)2.\n\nH+ from HCl: 0.08 moles\n\nOH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles (since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-)\n\nThe reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O. So they will neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nSo, moles of H+ from HCl = 0.08, moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.18.\n\nThe OH- is in excess here. The H+ will be completely neutralized, and the remaining OH- will be 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.\n\nSo after neutralizing the HCl, there's 0.10 moles of OH- left.\n\nNow, this excess OH- will react with the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it can donate H+ to neutralize the OH-.\n\nThe reaction between acetic acid and OH- would be:\n\nCH3COOH + OH- \u2192 CH3COO- + H2O\n\nSo each mole of OH- will consume one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of CH3COO-.\n\nWe have 0.05 moles of CH3COOH initially. The OH- remaining after neutralizing HCl is 0.10 moles. Since 0.10 moles of OH- is more than the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, all the acetic acid will be neutralized, and there will still be excess OH- left.\n\nSo, moles of OH- after reacting with acetic acid: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.\n\nTherefore, after all reactions, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles.\n\nNow, we need to find the concentration of OH- in the final solution. To do that, we need the total volume of the solution.\n\nTotal volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\nSo, concentration of OH- is moles/volume = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L \u2248 0.041666... M\n\nThen, pOH = -log[OH-] \u2248 -log(0.041666)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nlog(0.041666) = log(4.1666 x 10^-2) \u2248 log(4.1666) + log(10^-2) \u2248 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802\n\nSo pOH \u2248 1.3802\n\nTherefore, pH = 14 - pOH \u2248 14 - 1.3802 \u2248 12.6198, which is approximately 12.62.\n\nLooking at the options, that's option C: 12.62.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have messed up.\n\nFirst, moles of HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.\n\nMoles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.\n\nSo H+ (0.08) and OH- (0.18). The OH- is more, so after neutralization, excess OH- is 0.10 moles.\n\nThen, that OH- reacts with acetic acid. Acetic acid has 0.05 moles. So 0.05 moles of OH- will neutralize 0.05 moles of acetic acid, leaving 0.05 moles OH- remaining. Wait, no, the OH- is 0.10 initially, so after using 0.05 moles to neutralize acetic acid, the remaining OH- is 0.05. That's correct.\n\nTotal volume is indeed 1200 mL. So 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666...\n\npOH is about 1.38, so pH is 12.62. That's option C. Hmm, but let me check if there's any other factor I missed.\n\nWait, when the OH- neutralizes the acetic acid, does that produce acetate ions? Yes, but since we're only concerned with the excess OH-, the acetate ions are spectators here. The remaining OH- concentration is what determines the pH.\n\nAlternatively, if there was excess acetic acid, we would have to consider the contribution of H+ from the remaining acetic acid, but in this case, all the acetic acid was neutralized, and there's excess OH-, so the solution is basic, and the pH is determined by the excess OH-.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. The answer should be C, 12.62.\n\nWait, but let me check the answer options again. The options are A. 8.92, B. 8.68, C. 12.62, D. 1.38. So 12.62 is an option. Hmm, but let me think again if I made a mistake in the OH- calculation.\n\nWait, another way: Let me recalculate the moles step by step.\n\nFirst, HCl is 0.2 M in 0.4 L: 0.08 moles H+.\n\nBa(OH)2 is 0.3 M in 0.3 L: 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles OH-.\n\nSo H+ from HCl: 0.08, OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.\n\nThe reaction between H+ and OH- gives water. The net OH- remaining is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.\n\nThen, this OH- will react with acetic acid. Acetic acid has 0.05 moles. Each mole of OH- can deprotonate a mole of acetic acid. So 0.05 moles of OH- will be used up, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.\n\nTotal OH- is 0.05 moles. Total volume is 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 \u2248 0.041666...\n\npOH = -log(0.041666) \u2248 1.38, so pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the volume? Let me check the total volume again: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L. Correct.\n\nHmm, so I think that's right. So the answer should be C. 12.62.\n\nWait, but let me think again if there's another way. Suppose someone might think that the acetic acid contributes H+? But since we have excess OH-, which is a strong base, it would neutralize any H+ from the acetic acid. Since all the acetic acid was neutralized, there's no H+ left from it. The only H+ comes from HCl, but that was already neutralized. So the remaining OH- is the only thing contributing to the pH. So yes, the pH is 12.62. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the pOH? Let me compute log(0.041666):\n\nlog(0.041666) = log(4.1666 x 10^-2). Let me compute log(4.1666):\n\nlog(4) is 0.60206, log(4.1666) is a bit higher. Since 4.1666 is 25/6 \u22484.166666...\n\nlog(4.1666) \u2248 0.6198. So log(4.1666 x10^-2) is 0.6198 -2 = -1.3802. So pOH is 1.3802, so pH is 14 -1.3802 = 12.6198, which rounds to 12.62. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo determine the pH of the solution formed by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate moles of each component:**\n   - **CH3COOH (acetic acid):** \n     \\[\n     0.1 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.5 \\, \\text{L} = 0.05 \\, \\text{moles}\n     \\]\n   - **HCl (hydrochloric acid):** \n     \\[\n     0.2 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.4 \\, \\text{L} = 0.08 \\, \\text{moles of H}^+\n     \\]\n   - **Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide):** \n     \\[\n     0.3 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.3 \\, \\text{L} = 0.09 \\, \\text{moles of Ba(OH)}_2\n     \\]\n     Each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 moles of OH-, so:\n     \\[\n     0.09 \\times 2 = 0.18 \\, \\text{moles of OH}^-\n     \\]\n\n2. **Neutralization reaction between H+ and OH-:**\n   - H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles\n   - OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles\n   - Excess OH- after neutralization:\n     \\[\n     0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \\, \\text{moles of OH}^-\n     \\]\n\n3. **Reaction of excess OH- with CH3COOH:**\n   - CH3COOH moles: 0.05\n   - OH- reacts with CH3COOH in a 1:1 ratio:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Remaining OH}^- = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \\, \\text{moles}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the concentration of OH- in the final solution:**\n   - Total volume of the solution:\n     \\[\n     500 \\, \\text{mL} + 400 \\, \\text{mL} + 300 \\, \\text{mL} = 1200 \\, \\text{mL} = 1.2 \\, \\text{L}\n     \\]\n   - Concentration of OH-:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{0.05 \\, \\text{moles}}{1.2 \\, \\text{L}} \\approx 0.04167 \\, \\text{M}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate pOH and pH:**\n   - pOH:\n     \\[\n     \\text{pOH} = -\\log(0.04167) \\approx 1.38\n     \\]\n   - pH:\n     \\[\n     \\text{pH} = 14 - \\text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62\n     \\]\n\nThus, the pH of the solution is \\(\\boxed{C}\\)."
