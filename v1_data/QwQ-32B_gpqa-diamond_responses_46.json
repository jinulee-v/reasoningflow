        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which compound this is based on the given IR and NMR data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the IR spectrum. The key bands mentioned are medium to strong at 3420 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9, and a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9. \n\nThe 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is a strong indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O). That could be part of a carboxylic acid, ester, amide, or ketone. But looking at the other IR bands: the peaks around 3400 and 3300 cm\u207b\u00b9 are likely due to N-H stretching. Since there are two peaks, maybe it's an amine (primary or secondary) because primary amines have two N-H bands, while secondary would have one. But wait, the problem says \"medium to strong intensity bands\" at those positions. So maybe it's a primary amine? Or maybe an amide? Wait, amides have N-H stretching around 3300 but usually a bit sharper and maybe a bit lower? Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe carbonyl at 1720 is probably an ester or amide. Because carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H stretch around 3000-2500, but here the O-H isn't mentioned. Wait, the IR data given doesn't mention a broad O-H band, so maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. So between ester and amide. \n\nNow looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several peaks. Let's list them:\n\n1.20 ppm (t, 3H) \u2013 that's a methyl group, probably from an ethyl group (since a methyl adjacent to an oxygen would be around 1-2 ppm, but a CH3 in an ethyl group as a methyl group would be a triplet from the adjacent CH2). The t (triplet) at 1.2 ppm is typical for a CH3 in an ethyl group (like CH3CH2-O- or CH2CH3).\n\nThen 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) \u2013 broad singlet, which could be an amino group (NH2). The \"bs\" suggests it's a broad signal, maybe due to exchange with D2O or something, but in the NMR spectrum, if it's not deuterated, maybe it's an amine.\n\nThen 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) \u2013 a quartet, which would be the CH2 adjacent to the ethyl group. So that's the CH2-O- part. So putting that together, the ethyl group is probably an ethoxy group (O-CH2CH3), since the ethyl is connected via an oxygen. So that would be an ethoxy group (OEt) attached somewhere.\n\nThen the aromatic peaks: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Those are typical for aromatic protons. The 7.0 and 8.0 ppm suggest that the protons are in a meta or para position. Since they are split into two doublets, maybe it's a para-disubstituted benzene? Because if it's para, the two doublets would be on either side. Alternatively, maybe ortho? Wait, but ortho would have more complex splitting. Let me think. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the two protons on one side are deshielded (like if there's an electron-withdrawing group), so maybe the 8.0 is more upfield or downfield? Wait, 7.0 is lower than 8.0, so maybe the 8.0 is more downfield. Hmm, maybe the substituents are electron-withdrawing, so the protons next to them are deshielded. \n\nPutting this together, the molecule has an ethoxy group (from the 1.20 and 4.5 ppm signals), an amino group (the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm?), and aromatic protons. The carbonyl group from the IR is either an ester or amide. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption A: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have a formamide group (CONH2) attached to a phenyl group which has an ethoxy group in the 4-position. The formamide would have a carbonyl at around 1720 (amide I band is around 1650, but formamide might have a different carbonyl? Wait, formamide is an amide, so the carbonyl would be around 1650-1680 cm\u207b\u00b9. But the IR here has a strong band at 1720, which is higher, so maybe that's an ester. Hmm, so maybe A is not correct because the carbonyl would be lower for an amide. Wait, maybe I need to check the carbonyl frequencies again. \n\nCarbonyl groups: \n\n- Carboxylic acid: around 1700, but with broad O-H.\n\n- Ester: around 1740-1730.\n\n- Amide: around 1650 (amide I is the C=O stretch, but it's usually around 1640-1680, but maybe formamide is a bit different? Let me recall. Formamide's carbonyl is around 1655 cm\u207b\u00b9. So if the IR has a strong band at 1720, that's more like an ester. So maybe the compound is an ester. \n\nSo if the carbonyl is an ester, then the structure would have an ester group. Let's see the options again.\n\nOption C is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be an ester (ethyl group attached to a carboxylate, so O-CO-OEt), and the benzene ring has an amino group in the 4-position. The structure would be: \n\nPhenyl group with -COOEt and -NH2 on the 4-position. \n\nThe NMR of that would have the ethyl group (from the ester): the CH2CH3 would be at 1.2 ppm (triplet) and the CH2 next to the ester oxygen would be a quartet at around 4.2-4.5 ppm. The amino group (NH2) would be a broad singlet, maybe around 4.0 ppm. The aromatic protons: the 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group and the ester group on the benzene. The positions: if the amino is para to the ester, then the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. Let me think about the chemical shifts. \n\nIn benzoic acid derivatives, the carboxyl group is electron-withdrawing, so the aromatic protons adjacent to it would be deshielded (higher ppm). But in the ester, the ester group is also electron-withdrawing. So if the amino is on the 4-position (para to the ester), then the protons on the 2 and 6 positions would be around 7.0-8.0? Wait, maybe the positions are different. Let me sketch it mentally. \n\nSuppose the benzene ring has the ester group (COOEt) at position 1, then the amino group is at position 4. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the amino and meta to the ester. The protons at positions 3 and 5 would be meta to the amino and ortho to the ester. The electron-withdrawing groups (ester and amino?) would affect the chemical shifts. Wait, amino is electron-donating, so maybe the protons next to the amino would be less deshielded. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the aromatic peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 are from a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option C: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is O2C-Ph-NH2 with the ethyl ester. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets because of the two substituents (the ester and the amino). The amino group is para to the ester. The protons adjacent to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded (higher ppm), while those adjacent to the amino (positions 3 and 5) would be less so. Wait, but amino is electron-donating, so maybe the protons next to the amino would be more shielded (lower ppm). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 correspond to the two sets of protons. Let's see, in 4-aminobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons are around 7.0-8.0. The ester would replace the -COOH with -COOEt, so similar shifts. \n\nThe NMR data shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0, each with 2H. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, each in a doublet. That would happen if the substituents are in the para positions. For example, if there are two substituents on the benzene ring in the para positions, then the remaining protons would be in two doublets. Wait, but in this case, there are two substituents: the ester and the amino group. If they are para to each other, then the remaining four protons would be split into two doublets (each pair of protons on either side). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the amino group is ortho to the ester? But that would complicate the splitting. \n\nAlternatively, looking at option B: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionate ester (COOCH2CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring at position 4, with an amino group also on the benzene. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check the formula for each option:\n\nOption A: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide is CONH2. The ethoxyphenyl is C7H7O (C6H5-O-CH2CH3?), wait no. Wait, phenyl is C6H5, so 4-ethoxyphenyl would be C6H4-OCH2CH3. Then formamide is CONH2. So total carbons: 6 (phenyl) + 3 (ethoxy) + 1 (formyl?) Wait, formamide is HCONH2. So the formyl group is CH(O)NH2. So the total carbons would be phenyl (6) + ethoxy (2) + formyl (1) + the NH2 (no carbons). So total C: 6+2+1=9. H: phenyl (5 H) + ethoxy (5 H: OCH2CH3 has 5 H?), wait let's count:\n\nPhenyl (C6H5) has 5 H. Ethoxy (OCH2CH3) has 5 H (the ethyl group has 5 H: 2 in CH2 and 3 in CH3). The formamide: HCONH2 has 1 H (the H on the formyl group) plus the NH2 (2 H). So total H: 5 (phenyl) +5 (ethoxy) +1 (formyl H) +2 (NH2) = 13 H? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me do it again:\n\nN-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:\n\nThe phenyl group with ethoxy: C6H4-OCH2CH3. That's 6 + 3 (from ethoxy) = 9 carbons? Wait, no. Wait, the phenyl is C6H5, so adding OCH2CH3 (which is 3 carbons: O is not counted in the carbon count). Wait, the ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, so that's 2 carbons (the ethyl part). So total carbons in the phenyl part: 6 (phenyl) + 2 (ethoxy) = 8. Then the formamide is HCONH2, which adds 1 carbon (the formyl group). So total C: 8 +1 =9. That's correct. \n\nHydrogens: phenyl (C6H4-OCH2CH3): the phenyl ring has 5 H (since two positions are substituted: the ethoxy and the formamide? Wait, no. Wait, the formamide is attached to the phenyl as well. Wait, the structure is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide is attached to the phenyl group at the 4-position? Wait, no. Wait, the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That means the formamide's nitrogen is attached to the phenyl group. So the formamide is HCONH-(4-ethoxyphenyl). Wait, no, the formamide is HCONH2, but the N is substituted with the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure is H2N-C(=O)-NH-4-ethoxyphenyl? Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. So substituting one of the NH2 groups with a phenyl group would make it N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the structure is H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Wait, no, maybe it's H2N-C(=O)-Ph-OEt? Wait, no, the formamide is HCONH2, so substituting one of the NH2 with the phenyl group would give H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. \n\nThe name N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: formamide is HCONH2. The N here is the nitrogen of the formamide. So one of the NH2 groups is replaced by the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure would be H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Wait, no, that would be a secondary amide. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. If you replace one H on the NH2 with a phenyl group, it becomes N-phenylformamide. So in this case, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Wait, no, the phenyl group is substituted on the nitrogen. So the structure is:\n\nThe formamide group is HCONH-Ph-OEt. Wait, no, the formamide is HCONH2, so substituting one of the NH2 hydrogens with the 4-ethoxyphenyl group gives H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Wait, no, that would be a secondary amide. Wait, actually, formamide is HCONH2. So if you have N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, that would be:\n\nThe formamide's nitrogen has two substituents: one is the formyl group (HCON-) and the other is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. The nitrogen has two hydrogens and is connected to the formyl group. So substituting one of the hydrogens with a phenyl group would give H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Wait, perhaps the structure is H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? No, that would be a secondary amide with two NH groups. Wait, maybe it's H2N-C(=O)-Ph-OEt? No, that would be a primary amide. Wait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nThe formamide is HCONH2, so the nitrogen has two hydrogens and is connected to the carbonyl. If one of the hydrogens is replaced by a 4-ethoxyphenyl group, then it becomes H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Wait, no, that would have two NH groups. Alternatively, maybe it's H2N-C(=O)-Ph-OEt, but that would be a primary amide where the phenyl is attached to the carbonyl. Wait, no, the name says N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the phenyl group is attached to the nitrogen. So the structure is:\n\nThe formamide's nitrogen has one hydrogen and the phenyl group, so it's H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Wait, no, that would have two NH groups. Wait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nThe formamide is HCONH2. The N is substituted with the phenyl group, so it's H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at the molecular formula again. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate for option A:\n\nN-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide:\n\nThe formamide part is HCONH2 (which is C1H3NO2). The 4-ethoxyphenyl group is C7H7O (since phenyl is C6H5, plus OCH2CH3 which adds 2 carbons and 5 H). Wait, phenyl is C6H5, so adding OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) gives C6H4-OCH2CH3 (total C:6+2=8, H:5 (from phenyl) +5 (from ethoxy) =10 H). Then the formamide part: HCONH2 has 1 C, 3 H (H from formyl and two H on NH2). But when substituting one H on the NH2 with the phenyl group, the formamide would lose one H (since the phenyl is attached to the N). So total H would be:\n\nFormamide part: originally HCONH2 has 3 H (H on formyl, two on NH2). After substitution, one H is replaced by the phenyl group, so formamide contributes 2 H (formyl H and one NH H). \n\nThen the phenyl group (with ethoxy) has 10 H (from earlier). \n\nTotal H: 2 (formamide) +10 (phenyl) =12? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, discrepancy here. Maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is:\n\nThe formamide is HCONH-Ph-OEt. Wait, that would be a primary amide where the phenyl is attached to the carbonyl. Wait, no, the name says N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the phenyl is on the nitrogen. So the structure is:\n\nThe formamide's nitrogen has two substituents: one is the formyl group (C=O) and the other is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. Wait, but formamide's nitrogen is already bonded to the formyl group and two hydrogens. So substituting one H with the phenyl would give:\n\nH2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? No, that would have two NH groups. Alternatively, maybe it's H2N-C(=O)-Ph-OEt, but that would be a primary amide with the phenyl attached to the carbonyl. Wait, but the name specifies the phenyl is on the nitrogen. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is:\n\nThe formamide is HCONH2, and the N is substituted with the 4-ethoxyphenyl group, so it's H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? That would have two NH groups. Let's count the atoms:\n\nCarbon: formamide has 1 (from formyl) + phenyl (6) + ethoxy (2) = 9. That's correct.\n\nHydrogen: formamide's HCONH2 has 3 H (formyl H and two NH H). When substituting one NH H with the phenyl group, the formamide part would have 2 H (formyl H and one NH H). The phenyl group with ethoxy: the phenyl has 5 H (since two positions are substituted: the ethoxy and the formamide? Wait, no, the formamide is attached to the nitrogen, not the phenyl. Wait, the phenyl is part of the substituent on the nitrogen. So the phenyl group itself (with ethoxy) has 5 H (since it's a benzene ring with two substituents: ethoxy and the formamide's nitrogen? Wait, no, the ethoxy is on the phenyl, and the formamide's nitrogen is attached to the phenyl. So the phenyl group has two substituents: ethoxy and the formamide's nitrogen. Therefore, the phenyl ring has 4 H remaining. \n\nSo the phenyl group (with ethoxy and attached to the formamide's N) has 4 H. The ethoxy group has 5 H (OCH2CH3). The formamide part has 2 H (formyl H and one NH H). \n\nTotal H: 4 (phenyl) +5 (ethoxy) +2 (formamide) = 11 H. That matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Okay, so that works. \n\nSo option A has the right formula. Now, let's see the NMR data for option A. \n\nThe structure would be N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide has an NH2 group (since it's formamide with one H replaced by phenyl). Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. If one H on the NH2 is replaced by the phenyl group, then the remaining NH has one H. Wait, actually, the formamide's nitrogen has two substituents: the formyl group and the phenyl group, so it's a secondary amide? Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. If you replace one H on the NH2 with a phenyl group, then it becomes H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt? No, that would have two NH groups. Wait, perhaps it's a primary amide where the phenyl is attached to the nitrogen. Wait, maybe the structure is:\n\nThe formamide is HCONH-Ph-OEt. Wait, that would be a primary amide where the phenyl is attached to the nitrogen. So the structure is:\n\nPh-OEt-NH-C(=O)-H. That would be a primary amide. In that case, the nitrogen has two substituents: the phenyl group and the formyl group, plus one H. So the NH would have one H. \n\nIn that case, the NMR would have an NH signal. The formamide's NH would be a singlet or broad signal. The ethoxy group would have the CH2CH3 at 1.2 ppm (triplet) and the CH2 next to oxygen at ~4 ppm. Wait, but in the given NMR data, there's a quartet at 4.5 ppm (the CH2 next to the ethoxy oxygen?), and a triplet at 1.2 ppm. That matches. \n\nThe aromatic protons: the benzene ring has two substituents (the ethoxy and the formamide's NH group). Since they are in the 4-position (ethoxy is on the 4-position, and the formamide is attached to the same phenyl group, but where?), wait the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the formamide's nitrogen is attached to the 4-position of the phenyl group which already has an ethoxy group on the 4-position? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, the name is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The phenyl group has an ethoxy group on the 4-position, and the formamide's nitrogen is attached to the phenyl group. So the formamide is attached to the phenyl group at a different position? Wait, no, the name indicates that the phenyl group is substituted with ethoxy at the 4-position, and the entire phenyl group is attached to the formamide's nitrogen. So the formamide's nitrogen is connected to the phenyl group (which has an ethoxy group on the 4-position). Therefore, the phenyl group has two substituents: the ethoxy on the 4-position and the formamide's nitrogen on another position? Wait, but the name doesn't specify the position of the formamide's attachment. Hmm, maybe the formamide is attached to the 4-position as well? But that would be N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, so the phenyl group has an ethoxy on the 4-position and the formamide is attached to the same carbon? That would be a geminal substitution, which is possible but maybe less common. Alternatively, perhaps the formamide is attached to a different position, but the name doesn't specify, so maybe it's assumed to be on the same carbon? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formamide is attached to the phenyl group at the 4-position where the ethoxy is also present? That would mean the 4-position has both the ethoxy and the formamide's nitrogen. But that would be a very crowded carbon. Alternatively, maybe the formamide is attached to another position, but the ethoxy is on the 4-position. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's think about the aromatic protons. The NMR shows two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each with 2H. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of equivalent protons. If the substituents are in the 4-position (ethoxy and formamide), then the remaining protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Depending on the positions of the substituents, the protons could be split into two doublets. \n\nAlternatively, if the formamide is attached to the 1-position and the ethoxy to the 4-position, then the substituents are para. The remaining protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 would be meta to the ethoxy and ortho to the formamide, while 3 and 5 are meta to the formamide and ortho to the ethoxy. Depending on the electron-withdrawing effects, their chemical shifts would vary. \n\nThe formamide group is electron-withdrawing (since it's a carbonyl), so the protons adjacent to it would be deshielded (higher ppm). The ethoxy group is also electron-withdrawing (due to the oxygen), so protons adjacent to it would also be deshielded. \n\nSo the protons ortho to the formamide (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded than those ortho to the ethoxy (positions 3 and 5). Wait, but the ethoxy is also electron-withdrawing. Hmm, maybe the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 correspond to these positions. The higher ppm (8.0) would be the ones closer to the formamide, and the lower (7.0) closer to the ethoxy. That would make sense. \n\nSo the aromatic signals fit. The NH group from the formamide would be a singlet or broad signal. In the NMR data, there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). Wait, but formamide's NH is usually around 8-9 ppm, but in this case, since it's substituted with a phenyl group, maybe it's different. Wait, in formamide (HCONH2), the NH2 is around 8 ppm. If one H is replaced by a phenyl group, making it a secondary amide (H2N-C(=O)-NH-Ph-OEt?), then the NH would be around 7-8 ppm? Or maybe the NH is part of an amide, so it's a different environment. Wait, in amides, the NH protons are around 6-8 ppm, but in formamide, the NH2 is around 8 ppm. \n\nAlternatively, if the structure is a primary amide (Ph-OEt-NH-C(=O)-H), then the NH would be around 8 ppm. But in the NMR data, the NH signal is at 4.0 ppm, which is lower. That doesn't match. Hmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). If that's the NH2 group, then maybe it's a primary amine. But formamide has an amide group, not an amine. Wait, in option A, if it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the formamide's nitrogen has two substituents: the formyl group and the phenyl group. So it's a secondary amide, so the nitrogen has one H. Wait, no, formamide is HCONH2. If you substitute one H with the phenyl group, then the nitrogen has one H left. So the NH would be a singlet at maybe 7-8 ppm. But the NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm with 2H, which suggests two protons, so maybe it's an NH2 group. \n\nThis inconsistency suggests that option A might not be correct. Let me check option C: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. \n\nEthyl 4-aminobenzoate would have the structure: \n\nPhenyl group with -COOEt (ester group) and -NH2 on the 4-position. \n\nThe molecular formula: \n\nPhenyl (C6) + COOEt (C3: COOCH2CH3) + NH2 (no carbons). Total C:6+3=9. H: phenyl (5 H on the ring) + COOEt (5 H: OCH2CH3 has 5 H) + NH2 (2 H). Total H:5+5+2=12? Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, discrepancy again. Wait, let's count again:\n\nPhenyl group with 4-aminobenzoate: \n\nThe benzene ring has 6 C. The ester group is -COOEt (which is -COOCH2CH3). So that's 3 more C (COOCH2CH3 has 3 carbons: the COO is two O's but no C, so the ethyl part is 2 C plus the carbonyl's C? Wait, the ester group is -O-CO-CH2CH3. So the carbonyl is part of the ester. The total carbons from the ester: the COO is part of the ester, so the ethyl group is CH2CH3 (2 carbons). So total carbons from ester: 1 (from the carbonyl) + 2 (ethyl) = 3. So total C:6+3=9. \n\nHydrogens: \n\nPhenyl ring: with two substituents (the ester and the amino group), so 4 H on the ring. \n\nEster group: O-CO-CH2CH3. The ethyl group has 5 H (CH2CH3). \n\nAmino group: -NH2 has 2 H. \n\nTotal H:4 (phenyl) +5 (ethyl) +2 (NH2) =11. That matches the molecular formula C9H11NO2. \n\nOkay, so option C has the correct formula. \n\nNow, let's look at the NMR data for option C: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. \n\nThe structure is: \n\nPhenyl group with -COOEt on one position and -NH2 on the 4-position. \n\nThe ethyl group in the ester: the CH2CH3 would be at 1.2 ppm (triplet) and the CH2 next to the ester oxygen would be a quartet at ~4.2 ppm. The given NMR has a quartet at 4.5 ppm and triplet at 1.2, which matches. \n\nThe amino group (-NH2) would be a broad singlet, which is present at 4.0 ppm (2H). That matches. \n\nThe aromatic protons: the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). The remaining protons are at positions 2,3,5,6. \n\nThe substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions (assuming the ester is at position 1 and amino at 4, making them para). The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be meta to the amino and ortho to the ester. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to the ester and ortho to the amino. \n\nThe electron-withdrawing groups: the ester (COOEt) is more electron-withdrawing than the amino group (which is electron-donating). \n\nThe protons ortho to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded (higher ppm), while those ortho to the amino (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded (lower ppm). \n\nSo the two doublets would be at higher and lower ppm. The given NMR has doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. Let's see:\n\nThe protons ortho to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be around 7.5-8.0 ppm, and those ortho to the amino (positions 3 and 5) around 6.5-7.0 ppm. \n\nSo the two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 would correspond to these positions. The 7.0 ppm is the lower field (higher ppm) for the amino-adjacent protons? Wait, no, the amino is electron-donating, so the protons next to it would be less deshielded (lower ppm). The ester is electron-withdrawing, so protons next to it are more deshielded (higher ppm). \n\nTherefore, the protons ortho to the ester (positions 2 and 6) would be at higher ppm (like 8.0), and those ortho to the amino (positions 3 and 5) at lower ppm (like 7.0). That matches the given NMR data: 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). \n\nThe carbonyl in the ester would be at around 1740 cm\u207b\u00b9, which matches the IR's strong band at 1720 (close enough, maybe experimental error). \n\nThe N-H stretching for the amino group would be around 3300-3500 cm\u207b\u00b9, which matches the IR's medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325. The two peaks might be due to the two NH2 protons or splitting from coupling, but in an amino group, the two H's are equivalent, so a single peak, but sometimes broad. The presence of two peaks might suggest something else, but maybe it's just a broad signal split into two due to some factors. \n\nAlternatively, if the amino group is in an amide, but in this case, option C is an ester with an amino group, so the NH2 is free, giving the N-H bands. \n\nComparing to option A, which had inconsistencies in the NH signal's chemical shift, option C seems to fit better. \n\nOption B is 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionate ester (COOCH2CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring at position 4, with an amino group also on the benzene. The molecular formula would be C9H13NO2 (since propionate has 3 carbons in the ester part plus the benzene's 6, totaling 9, but the propyl group has more H). Wait, let's check:\n\nPhenyl (C6) + COOCH2CH2CH3 (4 carbons: COO is two O's, but the propyl is 3 C). Wait, COOCH2CH2CH3 is 3 carbons (the propyl group). So total C:6+3+1 (from the carbonyl?) Wait, no, the ester group is -COO-, so the total carbons from the ester are 3 (the propyl). So total C:6+3=9. \n\nHydrogens: phenyl with two substituents (the ester and amino) has 4 H on the ring. The propyl group (CH2CH2CH3) has 7 H (CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H: 2 in first CH2, 2 in second CH2, 3 in CH3). The amino group has 2 H. Total H:4+7+2=13. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So discrepancy here. So option B is incorrect. \n\nOption D is 3-ethoxybenzamide. That would be a benzamide (CONH2) attached to a benzene ring with an ethoxy group in the 3-position. \n\nMolecular formula: benzamide is C7H7NO2 (benzene + CONH2). Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would make it C9H11NO2. Wait, let's see:\n\nBenzamide: C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) to the benzene ring would add 2 C and 5 H (since replacing a H with OCH2CH3 adds 2 C and 4 H (since OCH2CH3 has 5 H but replaces one H)). So total C:7+2=9. H:7 (benzamide has 7 H on benzene? Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. The benzene has 5 H, plus the CONH2 has 2 H (the NH2). So total H:5+2+ (from ethoxy?) Wait, adding ethoxy to the benzene at position 3: the benzene would have 5 H minus one (replaced by ethoxy) plus the ethoxy's H. \n\nOriginal benzamide: benzene (5 H) + CONH2 (2 H) + the carbonyl and NH2. Adding ethoxy at 3: \n\nThe benzene now has 4 H (since one H is replaced by ethoxy). The ethoxy group has 5 H (OCH2CH3). The CONH2 has 2 H. Total H:4 +5 +2 =11. That matches C9H11NO2. \n\nSo option D also has the correct formula. \n\nNow, let's analyze option D's NMR. \n\nStructure: 3-ethoxybenzamide. \n\nThe ethoxy group is at position 3, and the benzamide is at another position (probably 1, making it para or meta). Wait, the name is 3-ethoxybenzamide, so the ethoxy is at 3, and the amide is at 1? Or is the amide attached to the benzene ring at a different position? Wait, benzamide is phenylCONH2. So the amide is attached to the benzene ring at a position, say position 1, and the ethoxy is at position 3. \n\nThe structure would be: \n\nPhenyl ring with -CONH2 at position 1 and -OCH2CH3 at position 3. \n\nThe NMR would have the ethoxy group's signals: the CH2CH3 at ~1.2 ppm (triplet) and the CH2 next to oxygen at ~4.2 ppm (quartet). The given NMR has a quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2, which matches. \n\nThe amide's NH2 would be a broad singlet. The given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), which matches. \n\nThe aromatic protons: the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 (amide) and 3 (ethoxy). The remaining protons are at 2,4,5,6. \n\nThe substituents are in positions 1 and 3 (meta to each other). The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the ethoxy and meta to the amide. The protons at 4 and 5 would be meta to the ethoxy and ortho to the amide. \n\nThe amide group is electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl), so protons adjacent to it (positions 2 and 6?) Wait, the amide is at position 1, so adjacent protons are 2 and 6. The ethoxy is at 3, adjacent to 2 and 4. \n\nThe protons ortho to the amide (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded (higher ppm), while those ortho to the ethoxy (positions 2 and 4) would also be deshielded. \n\nWait, position 2 is adjacent to both the amide and the ethoxy? No, position 2 is adjacent to the amide (position 1) and the ethoxy (position 3). So position 2 is ortho to both substituents. \n\nThis might complicate the chemical shifts. The protons at position 2 would be between two electron-withdrawing groups, so highly deshielded. The protons at 4 and 6 would be less so. \n\nAlternatively, the aromatic signals might be split into more than two peaks, but the given NMR shows two doublets. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are in positions that lead to two doublets. Let me think:\n\nIf the amide is at position 1 and ethoxy at 3, then the remaining protons are at 2,4,5,6. \n\nProtons at 2: adjacent to both substituents (positions 1 and 3), so highly deshielded (maybe around 7.5 ppm). \n\nProtons at 4: adjacent to ethoxy (position 3) and across from amide (position 1), so maybe around 7.0 ppm. \n\nProtons at 5 and 6: position 5 is meta to the amide and ethoxy, and position 6 is meta to the ethoxy and ortho to the amide. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. The given NMR has two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0. If in option D, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, maybe the higher ppm (8.0) is from the protons near the amide, and lower (7.0) near the ethoxy. \n\nThe carbonyl in the amide would be around 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9, but the IR shows a strong band at 1720, which is more like an ester. Since option D is an amide, the carbonyl would be at ~1650, conflicting with the IR data. \n\nAh, here's the key point. The IR has a strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is characteristic of an ester (around 1730-1740), not an amide (amide I is ~1650). Therefore, option D (amide) would have a carbonyl at ~1650, which doesn't match the given IR. So option D is out. \n\nTherefore, between options A and C. \n\nEarlier, option A had an issue with the NH signal's chemical shift. Let's revisit that. \n\nOption A: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. \n\nIf the structure is a secondary amide where the nitrogen has the formyl group and the phenyl group, then the NH would be part of the amide. In amides, the NH protons are around 6-8 ppm. If the NH is in a formamide derivative, maybe it's around 8 ppm. But the given NMR has the NH signal at 4.0 ppm, which is much lower. That suggests it's not an amide but an amino group. \n\nTherefore, option C (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) has an NH2 group, which would give a broad signal around 4-5 ppm, matching the given data. The carbonyl at 1720 is an ester, which fits. \n\nThus, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\n\nThe compound is identified as **C. ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. Here's the breakdown:\n\n### **Key Analysis:**\n1. **Molecular Formula**: C\u2089H\u2081\u2081NO\u2082 matches all options except B (which has too many H atoms).\n\n2. **IR Spectroscopy**:\n   - **1720 cm\u207b\u00b9**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, indicative of an **ester group** (esters typically show peaks around 1730\u20131740 cm\u207b\u00b9).\n   - **3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9**: Broad N-H stretching vibrations from an **amine group** (NH\u2082), consistent with a primary amine.\n\n3. **\u00b9H NMR Analysis**:\n   - **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Methyl group (CH\u2083) of the ethyl ester (OCH\u2082CH\u2083).\n   - **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Broad singlet due to the **NH\u2082 group**.\n   - **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Methylene group (CH\u2082) adjacent to the ester oxygen (OCH\u2082CH\u2083).\n   - **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two sets of aromatic protons. The lower field (8.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the higher field (7.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group.\n\n4. **Structural Deduction**:\n   - The **ester group (COOEt)** and **NH\u2082 group** are para-substituted on the benzene ring (positions 1 and 4, respectively).\n   - The aromatic protons split into two doublets due to the substituents' electronic effects, matching the observed chemical shifts.\n\n### **Elimination of Other Options**:\n- **A. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: \n  - The NH signal would be around 6\u20138 ppm (amide NH), not 4.0 ppm (amine NH\u2082). The IR carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is inconsistent with an amide (amide carbonyls are ~1650 cm\u207b\u00b9).\n- **B. 4-aminophenyl propionate**: Incorrect molecular formula (too many H atoms).\n- **D. 3-ethoxybenzamide**: The IR carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 contradicts the amide carbonyl (~1650 cm\u207b\u00b9). The NH\u2082 signal would also be absent (amide has NH, not NH\u2082).\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe data align perfectly with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (C)**, which has the correct molecular formula, IR features (ester carbonyl and amine N-H), and NMR signals (ester, amino, and aromatic protons).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{C}"

Then the formamide part: HCONH2 has 1 C, 3 H (H from formyl and two H on NH2). But when substituting one H on the NH2 with the phenyl group, the formamide would lose one H (since the phenyl is attached to the N). So total H would be:\n\nFormamide part: originally HCONH2 has 3 H (H on formyl, two on NH2). After substitution, one H is replaced by the phenyl group, so formamide contributes 2 H (formyl H and one NH H). \n\nThen the phenyl group (with ethoxy) has 10 H (from earlier). \n\nTotal H: 2 (formamide) +10 (phenyl) =12? But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, discrepancy here. Maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me try again.\n\n",

The lower field (8.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing ester group, while the higher field (7.0 ppm) corresponds to protons ortho to the electron-donating amino group.\n\n4. **Structural Deduction**:\n   - The **ester group (COOEt)** and **NH\u2082 group** are para-substituted on the benzene ring (positions 1 and 4, respectively).\n   - The aromatic protons split into two doublets due to the substituents' electronic effects, matching the observed chemical shifts.\n\n### **Elimination of Other Options**:\n- **A. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**: \n  - The NH signal would be around 6\u20138 ppm (amide NH), not 4.0 ppm (amine NH\u2082). The IR carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 is inconsistent with an amide (amide carbonyls are ~1650 cm\u207b\u00b9).\n- **B. 4-aminophenyl propionate**: Incorrect molecular formula (too many H atoms).\n- **D. 3-ethoxybenzamide**: The IR carbonyl at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9 contradicts the amide carbonyl (~1650 cm\u207b\u00b9). The NH\u2082 signal would also be absent (amide has NH, not NH\u2082).\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThe data align perfectly with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (C)**, which has the correct molecular formula, IR features (ester carbonyl and amine N-H), and NMR signals (ester, amino, and aromatic protons).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{C}",
