        "response": "Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schr\u00f6dinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given by |\u03c8> = (cos(\u03c6)|\u03b1> + sin(\u03c6)|-\u03b1>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The parameters given are \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4 and \u03b1 = 0.5. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by recalling what each part means and how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the relative entropy between two states \u03c1 and \u03c4 is defined as S(\u03c1 || \u03c4) = Tr(\u03c1 ln \u03c1) - Tr(\u03c1 ln \u03c4). Wait, but the problem statement says del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]. Hmm, that seems different from the standard definition. Let me check again. The user wrote: \"del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]\". Wait, that's not the standard relative entropy. The standard relative entropy is S(\u03c1 || \u03c4) = Tr(\u03c1 (ln \u03c1 - ln \u03c4)). So maybe there's a typo here? Or perhaps the problem defines it differently? Let me confirm the problem's exact wording.\n\nThe problem says: \"The relative entropy measure is given as, del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]\". So according to this, del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau. But that's not the usual relative entropy. The usual relative entropy is Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)), which is different. Hmm, maybe the problem is using a different definition here? Or perhaps it's a typo? Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the formula? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the relative entropy as the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau? But that would be S(rho) - S(tau). But that's not a standard measure of non-Gaussianity. The standard relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is usually defined as the minimal relative entropy between the state and any Gaussian state. But here, the problem specifies that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. Wait, but which Gaussian state? The problem might be considering the closest Gaussian state, but perhaps in this case, they are just comparing to the Gaussian state |\u03b1> or something else?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state\". Since the Schr\u00f6dinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1>, which are themselves Gaussian states. So maybe the reference Gaussian state \u03c4 is the mixture of these two states? Or perhaps the closest Gaussian state to the cat state?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is just the coherent state |\u03b1>, but that might not make sense. Let me see. The problem might be considering the reference Gaussian state as the Gaussian state that is closest in some sense to the cat state. But since the problem gives a specific formula for del_b as the difference between the entropies, perhaps they are using a different measure here. Alternatively, maybe there's confusion in the problem's wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy between the cat state and the Gaussian state that is the closest to it, but the formula given is different. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as the cat state? Because Gaussian states are determined by their first and second moments. So if we take the Gaussian state with the same mean and covariance matrix as the cat state, then compute the relative entropy between the cat state and that Gaussian state, that would be a measure of non-Gaussianity. But the problem's formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach. Let me check the problem again. The problem says: \"Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schr\u00f6dinger cat state using relative entropy measure. [...] The relative entropy measure is given as, del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))] where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\"\n\nSo according to the problem's definition, the non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the cat state and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. That is, nG = S(rho) - S(tau). But that's not the standard definition. The standard relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is the minimal relative entropy between the state and any Gaussian state, which would be S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho - rho ln tau). But here, the problem is defining it as S(rho) - S(tau). Hmm, that's different. Maybe the problem is using a different measure, so I have to follow their definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in the problem's formula. Let me see. Let me check the problem again. The user wrote:\n\n\"del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]\n\nwhere tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.\"\n\nSo according to this, del_b is S(rho) - S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the cat state and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. So I need to compute that.\n\nBut then, which Gaussian state is the reference? The problem says \"a reference Gaussian state\". Since the cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of those two coherent states? Because a mixture of Gaussian states is also Gaussian? Wait, no. A mixture of coherent states is not Gaussian unless it's a coherent state itself. Wait, actually, a mixture of coherent states is a Gaussian state only if it's a single coherent state. Otherwise, it's a non-Gaussian state. Wait, actually, the mixture of two coherent states is a Gaussian state? Let me think.\n\nWait, a coherent state is a pure Gaussian state. A mixture of two coherent states would be a statistical mixture, which is a mixed state. The density matrix would be (|\u03b1><\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|)/2, but that is not a Gaussian state. Because Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian, and a mixture of two coherent states would have a Wigner function that is a sum of two Gaussians, which is not a Gaussian. Therefore, that mixture is non-Gaussian. Therefore, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the coherent state |\u03b1>, but then the problem would need to specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as the cat state. Let me think.\n\nThe cat state is |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. Let me compute its density matrix first. The density matrix rho is |\u03c8><\u03c8|. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute N. The normalization constant N is given by N = sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)). Since \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, let's compute sin(2\u03c6). 2\u03c6 = -\u03c0/2, so sin(-\u03c0/2) = -1. Therefore, sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) = -exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = -exp(-0.5). Therefore, N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Let me compute that numerically. exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 \u2248 0.3935, so sqrt(0.3935) \u2248 0.627. So N \u2248 0.627. Let me note that.\n\nNow, the density matrix rho is (1/N\u00b2)(cos \u03c6 |\u03b1><\u03b1| + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 |\u03b1><-\u03b1| + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 |-\u03b1><\u03b1| + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|). Since phi is -\u03c0/4, cos(phi) = cos(-\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.7071, sin(phi) = sin(-\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 \u2248 -0.7071. Therefore, cos(phi) sin(phi) = (\u221a2/2)(-\u221a2/2) = -0.5. Similarly, sin(phi) cos(phi) is the same. So the cross terms are -0.5 |\u03b1><-\u03b1| and -0.5 |-\u03b1><\u03b1|. The diagonal terms are (cos\u00b2 phi)|\u03b1><\u03b1| + sin\u00b2 phi |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|. Since cos\u00b2(-\u03c0/4) = 0.5, sin\u00b2(-\u03c0/4)=0.5, so the diagonal terms are 0.5 |\u03b1><\u03b1| + 0.5 |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|. But then multiplied by 1/N\u00b2. Wait, but N\u00b2 is 1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Since sin(2\u03c6) is -1, so N\u00b2 = 1 - exp(-0.5). Therefore, the density matrix is [0.5(|\u03b1><\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|) - 0.5(|\u03b1><-\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><\u03b1|)] / (1 - exp(-0.5)). Hmm, that's the density matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as:\n\nrho = (1/N\u00b2)[cos\u00b2 \u03c6 |\u03b1><\u03b1| + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 |-\u03b1><-\u03b1| + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (|\u03b1><-\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><\u03b1|)]\n\nBut with the given phi and alpha, substituting the values:\n\ncos\u00b2(phi) = 0.5, sin\u00b2(phi) = 0.5, cos(phi) sin(phi) = -0.5. So:\n\nrho = (1/(1 - exp(-0.5))) [0.5 |\u03b1><\u03b1| + 0.5 |-\u03b1><-\u03b1| - 0.5 (|\u03b1><-\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><\u03b1|) ]\n\nSo that simplifies to:\n\nrho = [ (0.5(|\u03b1><\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|) - 0.5(|\u03b1><-\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><\u03b1|) ) ] / (1 - exp(-0.5))\n\nHmm, okay. Now, the reference Gaussian state tau. Since the problem says \"a reference Gaussian state\", but doesn't specify which one. Maybe it's the Gaussian state that is the closest to the cat state in terms of some metric? But since the problem gives a formula for del_b as the difference between the entropies, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state? Because Gaussian states are determined by their first and second moments, so if we compute the first and second moments of the cat state and then construct the Gaussian state with those moments, then compute the entropy difference between the cat state and that Gaussian state, that would be the measure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the coherent state |\u03b1>, but then the problem would need to specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the vacuum state? But that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state or something else. Hmm. Since the problem is from an exam or quiz, perhaps there is a standard reference Gaussian state for the cat state. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two coherent states, but as I thought earlier, that's not Gaussian. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that is the closest in terms of the relative entropy. But since the problem gives a formula for del_b as S(rho) - S(tau), then perhaps we need to compute the entropy of the cat state and subtract the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But which Gaussian state?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that is the closest in terms of the fidelity or something else, but without more information, perhaps the problem is considering the reference Gaussian state as the coherent state |\u03b1>, but let me check.\n\nWait, let me think of the standard approach. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is usually defined as the minimal relative entropy between the state and any Gaussian state. So S(rho || tau), minimized over all Gaussian states tau. But here, the problem is using a different definition, as per their formula. Since they define del_b as S(rho) - S(tau), then perhaps they are using the difference between the entropy of the cat state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. But to compute that, we need to know which Gaussian state is the closest. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the reference Gaussian state as the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state, so that the entropy difference can be computed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me see if there's a standard formula for the entropy of a Schr\u00f6dinger cat state and the entropy of a Gaussian state, so that their difference can be computed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state? Let me see. Let me try to compute the entropy of the cat state and the entropy of a Gaussian state, perhaps the vacuum state, and see if the difference matches one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the coherent state |\u03b1>, so let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the entropy of the cat state. The entropy S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho). Since the cat state is a pure state? Wait, no. Wait, the cat state is a pure state, right? Wait, the state given is |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. Since it's a normalized pure state, its density matrix is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, hold on. Wait, if the state is a pure state, then its von Neumann entropy is zero. But in the problem, the cat state is written as a superposition of two coherent states, which are themselves pure Gaussian states. However, the superposition is a non-Gaussian state, but it's still a pure state. Therefore, its entropy S(rho) is zero. But then, if the reference Gaussian state is also a pure Gaussian state, like a coherent state, then its entropy is also zero, so the difference would be zero. But option B is 0, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, but maybe the cat state is not a pure state? Wait, let me check the normalization. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)). Let me confirm that. The inner product of (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>) with itself is cos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 2 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| -\u03b1>. The inner product <\u03b1| -\u03b1> is exp(-|\u03b1 - (-\u03b1)|\u00b2) = exp(- (2 \u03b1)^2 )? Wait, no. Wait, the inner product between |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1> is <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-|\u03b1 + \u03b1|\u00b2 / 2) ? Wait, actually, the inner product between coherent states |\u03b1> and |\u03b2> is exp(-|\u03b1|\u00b2/2 - |\u03b2|\u00b2/2 + \u03b1* \u03b2). Wait, let me recall the formula for the inner product of coherent states.\n\nThe coherent state |\u03b1> is defined as the eigenstate of the annihilation operator a with eigenvalue \u03b1. The inner product <\u03b2|\u03b1> is exp(-|\u03b1|\u00b2/2 - |\u03b2|\u00b2/2 + \u03b1* \u03b2). Therefore, <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-|\u03b1|\u00b2 - |\u03b1|\u00b2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)^*) = exp(-2|\u03b1|\u00b2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)^*). Wait, but \u03b1 is a complex number, but in the problem, it's given as \"amplitude\", so maybe it's real? Let me assume \u03b1 is real for simplicity, as the problem didn't specify otherwise. So if \u03b1 is real, then <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)) = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2 - \u03b1\u00b2) = exp(-3 \u03b1\u00b2). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recast.\n\nWait, if \u03b1 is real, then \u03b2 = -\u03b1 is also real. So <\u03b2|\u03b1> = exp(-|\u03b1|\u00b2/2 - |\u03b2|\u00b2/2 + \u03b1 \u03b2). Since \u03b2 = -\u03b1, this becomes exp(-\u03b1\u00b2/2 - \u03b1\u00b2/2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)) = exp(-\u03b1\u00b2 - \u03b1\u00b2) = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Wait, that's better. So <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Therefore, the inner product of the state (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>) with itself is:\n\ncos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 2 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) = 1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Therefore, the normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)), which matches the given N. So the state is indeed a pure state, so its density matrix is pure, so its entropy S(rho) is zero. Therefore, if the reference Gaussian state is also a pure Gaussian state (like a coherent state), then its entropy is also zero, so del_b would be 0 - 0 = 0, which is option B. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem gives other options. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a mixed state?\n\nWait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two coherent states, which is a mixed Gaussian state? Wait, but earlier I thought that a mixture of two coherent states is not Gaussian. Let me confirm that. The density matrix of a mixture of two coherent states is (|\u03b1><\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|)/2. The Wigner function of this state is (W_\u03b1 + W_{-\u03b1}) / 2, where W_\u03b1 is the Wigner function of |\u03b1>. Since each Wigner function is a Gaussian centered at (p,q) = (Re(\u03b1), Im(\u03b1)) and (-Re(\u03b1), -Im(\u03b1)), respectively. The sum of two Gaussians is not a Gaussian, so the mixture is non-Gaussian. Therefore, that can't be the reference Gaussian state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state. Let me compute the first and second moments of the cat state.\n\nThe first moment (mean) of the cat state is <\u03c8| a |\u03c8>. Let me compute that. Since the state is |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. The annihilation operator a acting on |\u03b1> gives \u03b1 |\u03b1>, and on |-\u03b1> gives -\u03b1 |-\u03b1>. Therefore,\n\n<\u03c8| a |\u03c8> = (1/N\u00b2)[cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 < -\u03b1 | a | \u03b1> + cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a |\u03b1> + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> ]\n\nWait, actually, let me compute it step by step. Let me denote the state as |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. Then,\n\n<\u03c8| a |\u03c8> = (1/N\u00b2)[cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| ] a [cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= (1/N\u00b2)[ cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a |\u03b1> + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a |\u03b1> + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> ]\n\nNow, compute each term:\n\n<\u03b1| a |\u03b1> = \u03b1 <\u03b1|\u03b1> = \u03b1 (since |\u03b1> is normalized)\n\nSimilarly, <-\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> = (-\u03b1) <-\u03b1|-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\n\nThe cross terms:\n\n<\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> = <\u03b1| (-\u03b1) |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = -\u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) (since <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) as before)\n\nSimilarly, <-\u03b1| a |\u03b1> = <-\u03b1| \u03b1 |\u03b1> = \u03b1 <-\u03b1| \u03b1> = \u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nPutting all together:\n\n= (1/N\u00b2)[ cos\u00b2 \u03c6 * \u03b1 + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (-\u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)) + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)) + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 (-\u03b1) ]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\n\nSecond term: - cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 \u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nThird term: + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nFourth term: - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\n\nNotice that the second and third terms cancel each other because they are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So they sum to zero.\n\nTherefore, remaining terms:\n\ncos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1 = \u03b1 (cos\u00b2 \u03c6 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6) = \u03b1 cos(2\u03c6)\n\nGiven that \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, so 2\u03c6 = -\u03c0/2, so cos(2\u03c6) = cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0. Therefore, the first moment <a> is zero.\n\nHmm, interesting. So the mean displacement is zero. That's because the superposition of |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1> with equal weights (since cos\u00b2 and sin\u00b2 terms when \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4? Wait, cos(-\u03c0/4) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, so cos^2 and sin^2 are both 0.5. So the coefficients squared are equal, so the mean displacement cancels out. So the first moment is zero.\n\nNow, the second moments. The second moments for a Gaussian state are determined by the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix elements are <a^2>, <a\u2020^2>, <a a\u2020>, etc. But for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix is determined by the variances and covariances of the quadrature operators. Alternatively, the second moments can be computed as <a^2>, <a\u2020^2>, and <a a\u2020>.\n\nLet me compute <a^2> for the cat state. Let's compute <\u03c8| a\u00b2 |\u03c8>.\n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n<\u03c8| a\u00b2 |\u03c8> = (1/N\u00b2)[cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| ] a\u00b2 [cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> ]\n\nFirst, compute a\u00b2 |\u03b1>:\n\na\u00b2 |\u03b1> = a (a |\u03b1>) = a (\u03b1 |\u03b1>) = \u03b1 a |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 |\u03b1>\n\nSimilarly, a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = a (a |-\u03b1>) = a (-\u03b1 |-\u03b1>) = -\u03b1 a |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>\n\nTherefore,\n\n= (1/N\u00b2)[ cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> ]\n\nBreaking down each term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |\u03b1> = cos\u00b2 \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1|\u03b1>) = cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> )\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 |\u03b1> = sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2) <-\u03b1| \u03b1> (Wait, no. Wait, a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> is -\u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>, so when acting on |-\u03b1>, a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>, so <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = <\u03b1| (-\u03b1\u00b2) |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1>\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, the second term is cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (a\u00b2 acting on |-\u03b1> is -\u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>, so <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> )\n\nSimilarly, the third term is sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 |\u03b1> = sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (a\u00b2 acting on |\u03b1> is \u03b1\u00b2 |\u03b1>, so <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 <-\u03b1| \u03b1> )\n\nFourth term: sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2) <-\u03b1| -\u03b1> = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2)\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2))\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2))\n\nFourth term: - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nAgain, the second and third terms cancel each other because they are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (since cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 = -0.5 when \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, but the terms are multiplied by -\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) and +\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2), so they cancel).\n\nTherefore, remaining terms:\n\ncos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 (cos\u00b2 \u03c6 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6) = \u03b1\u00b2 cos(2\u03c6)\n\nAgain, with \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, cos(2\u03c6) = cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0. Therefore, <a\u00b2> = 0.\n\nHmm, interesting. So the second moment <a\u00b2> is also zero. Wait, but that can't be right? Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me recast with \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4. Then cos(2\u03c6) = cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0, so indeed, the terms cancel. So <a\u00b2> = 0. Similarly, <a\u2020\u00b2> would also be zero by the same logic.\n\nWait, but the expectation value of a^2 is zero? That seems odd, but given the symmetry of the state, maybe it's possible. Let me think of the state as a superposition of |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1>, so when you square the annihilation operator, which lowers the state twice, but given the symmetry, maybe it cancels out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let's compute <a\u00b2> again step by step.\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nFourth term: - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSo cos\u00b2 \u03c6 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 = cos(2\u03c6) = 0, so those terms cancel.\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2))\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2))\n\nThese terms are cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 * (-\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) + \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)) = 0. So yes, they cancel. So indeed, <a\u00b2> = 0.\n\nSimilarly, <a\u2020\u00b2> would be zero as well.\n\nNow, the other second moment is <a a\u2020>. Let's compute that.\n\nThe expectation value <a a\u2020> is equal to <a\u2020 a> + <1>, but actually, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a> + <1>, but since <1> is 1 (because the state is normalized), but actually, let me compute it directly.\n\nWait, <a a\u2020> is the expectation value of the number operator plus 1? Wait, a\u2020 a is the number operator, so a a\u2020 = a\u2020 a + 1. Therefore, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a> + 1 = <n> + 1. Since for a coherent state |\u03b1>, <n> = |\u03b1|\u00b2, so for the cat state, let's compute <a\u2020 a>.\n\nAlternatively, compute <a a\u2020> directly.\n\nCompute <\u03c8| a a\u2020 |\u03c8>.\n\nFirst, note that a a\u2020 = a\u2020 a + 1, so <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a> + 1. Let me compute <a\u2020 a>.\n\nThe expectation value of the number operator <n> = <a\u2020 a>.\n\nLet me compute <\u03c8| a\u2020 a |\u03c8>.\n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n<\u03c8| a\u2020 a |\u03c8> = (1/N\u00b2)[cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| ] a\u2020 a [cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> ]\n\nFirst, compute a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = a\u2020 (a |\u03b1>) = a\u2020 (\u03b1 |\u03b1>) = \u03b1 a\u2020 |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 |\u03b1> + \u03b1 (since a\u2020 |\u03b1> = (\u03b1 + d/d\u03b1) |\u03b1>, but actually, more straightforwardly, for coherent states, <n> = |\u03b1|\u00b2. Wait, actually, for a coherent state |\u03b1>, <a\u2020 a> = |\u03b1|\u00b2. Therefore, <a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = |\u03b1|\u00b2 |\u03b1>.\n\nSimilarly, <a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = | -\u03b1 |\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>.\n\nTherefore,\n\n= (1/N\u00b2)[ cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> ]\n\nBreaking down each term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = cos\u00b2 \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1|\u03b1>) = cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> )\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <-\u03b1| \u03b1> )\n\nFourth term: sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <-\u03b1| -\u03b1> ) = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, < -\u03b1 | a\u2020 a | -\u03b1 > is < -\u03b1 | (a\u2020 a) | -\u03b1 >. Since | -\u03b1 > is a coherent state, so <a\u2020 a> for |-\u03b1> is | -\u03b1 |\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2. Therefore, the fourth term is sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the inner product < -\u03b1 | -\u03b1 > is 1, so the fourth term is sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me correct:\n\nWait, the operator a\u2020 a acts on |-\u03b1>, giving \u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>, so the inner product < -\u03b1 | a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 < -\u03b1 | -\u03b1 > = \u03b1\u00b2 *1. So yes, fourth term is sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, the second term:\n\n<\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nThird term:\n\n<-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 <-\u03b1| \u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, putting all together:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nFourth term: sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSo combining terms:\n\nFirst and fourth terms: (cos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6) \u03b1\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond and third terms: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) = 2 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) = sin(2\u03c6) \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, total expectation value:\n\n< a\u2020 a > = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + sin(2\u03c6) \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) ] / N\u00b2\n\nBut N\u00b2 = 1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Therefore,\n\n< a\u2020 a > = [ \u03b1\u00b2 (1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) ) ] / N\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 N\u00b2 / N\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So <a\u2020 a> = \u03b1\u00b2. Therefore, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a> +1 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nWait, but that's the same as for a coherent state. Because in a coherent state, <a\u2020 a> = |\u03b1|\u00b2, so <a a\u2020> = |\u03b1|\u00b2 +1. So the expectation value of a a\u2020 for the cat state is the same as for a coherent state. That's because the cross terms canceled out?\n\nHmm, so the second moments for the cat state are the same as for a coherent state? Let me see:\n\nThe first moment <a> is zero, while for a coherent state |\u03b1>, it's \u03b1. But in our case, the cat state has <a> =0. The second moment <a\u00b2> is zero, while for a coherent state, <a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2. Wait, but in our case, <a\u00b2> is zero, but for a coherent state, it's \u03b1\u00b2. Wait, but the second moment <a a\u2020> is the same as for a coherent state. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the covariance matrix for a Gaussian state is determined by the variances and covariances of the quadrature operators. Let me recall that for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix elements can be written in terms of <a a\u2020>, <a\u00b2>, etc. Let me think in terms of quadrature operators.\n\nLet me define the quadrature operators X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 and P = (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2). Then the covariance matrix is a 2x2 matrix with elements <X\u00b2>, <P\u00b2>, and <XP>.\n\nCompute <X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] / 2\n\nWe have <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0 (by similar calculation as <a\u00b2>), and <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1. Therefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [0 + 0 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1)] / 2 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nSimilarly, <P\u00b2> = < (a - a\u2020)^2 / (-2) > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> - 2 <a a\u2020> ] / (-2). Wait, let me compute properly:\n\nWait, P = (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2), so P\u00b2 = (a - a\u2020)^2 / (-2). Therefore,\n\n<P\u00b2> = < (a - a\u2020)^2 / (-2) > = [ <a\u00b2> - 2 <a a\u2020> + <a\u2020\u00b2> ] / (-2)\n\nAgain, <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0, so:\n\n= [ -2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] / (-2) = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nThe cross term <XP> = <X P> = < (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 * (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) > = < (a\u00b2 - a\u2020\u00b2 + a a\u2020 - a\u2020 a ) / (i 2) >\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2 term: <a\u00b2> =0\n\n-a\u2020\u00b2 term: -<a\u2020\u00b2> =0\n\na a\u2020 term: <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\n- a\u2020 a term: - <a\u2020 a> = - \u03b1\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\n<XP> = [0 -0 + (\u03b1\u00b2 +1) - \u03b1\u00b2 ] / (i 2) = [1]/(i 2) = -i/(2)\n\nBut since covariance matrices are real, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, actually, the covariance matrix elements are typically taken as <X P> + <P X> over 2 or something? Wait, perhaps I need to compute the expectation value properly.\n\nWait, actually, the covariance matrix elements are usually defined as <X_i X_j> - <X_i><X_j>, but since the mean <X> and <P> are zero here (since <a> =0, so <X> = ( <a> + <a\u2020> ) /\u221a2 =0, similarly <P> =0), so the covariance matrix elements are just <X\u00b2>, <P\u00b2>, and <XP>.\n\nBut the cross term <XP> is imaginary? That can't be. Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation.\n\nLet me recompute <XP>:\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2\n\nP = (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nXP = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 * (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) = [ (a)(a) - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2 ] / (i 2)\n\nWait, expanding (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020):\n\n= a^2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\nXP = [a\u00b2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - a\u2020\u00b2 ] / (i 2)\n\nTaking expectation value:\n\n<XP> = [ <a\u00b2> - <a a\u2020> + <a\u2020 a> - <a\u2020\u00b2> ] / (i 2)\n\nWe know <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0, <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1, <a\u2020 a> = \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n= [0 - (\u03b1\u00b2 +1) + \u03b1\u00b2 -0 ] / (i 2) = [ -1 ] / (i 2) = i/(2)\n\nTherefore, <XP> = i/(2). But covariance matrices are real, so perhaps I need to take the real part? Wait, no. The covariance matrix for Gaussian states is real and symmetric, but here the expectation value is imaginary. That suggests that the cross term is imaginary, which might be okay because X and P are real operators, but their product can have an imaginary expectation value?\n\nWait, actually, the covariance matrix is defined using the symmetric correlation matrix, so perhaps we need to compute <XP + PX>/2. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute <XP + PX>/2:\n\nFirst, XP + PX = [a\u00b2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - a\u2020\u00b2 ] / (i 2) + [ (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) * (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 ]\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute XP + PX directly.\n\nWait, XP + PX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 * (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) + (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) * (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020)/(i 2)\n\nSecond term: (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020)/( -i 2 )\n\nWait, because (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) * (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 = (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020)/(i 2)\n\nWait, actually, let me compute:\n\nFirst term: (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 * (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) = [ (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020) ] / (i 2)\n\nSecond term: (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) * (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 = [ (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020) ] / (i 2)\n\nTherefore, XP + PX = [ (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020) + (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020) ] / (i 2 )\n\nBut (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020) = a\u00b2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2\n\nSimilarly, (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020) = a\u00b2 + a a\u2020 - a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2\n\nAdding them together:\n\n= [a\u00b2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2 + a\u00b2 + a a\u2020 - a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2 ] / (i 2 )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\na\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = 2a\u00b2\n\n- a a\u2020 + a a\u2020 = 0\n\na\u2020 a - a\u2020 a =0\n\n- (a\u2020)^2 - (a\u2020)^2 = -2 (a\u2020)^2\n\nTherefore, total:\n\n[2a\u00b2 - 2 (a\u2020)^2 ] / (i 2 ) = [a\u00b2 - (a\u2020)^2 ] / (i )\n\nTherefore, <XP + PX>/2 = [ <a\u00b2 - (a\u2020)^2> ] / (2i )\n\nBut <a\u00b2> =0 and <(a\u2020)^2> =0, so this expectation value is zero. Therefore, the symmetric part <XP + PX>/2 has zero expectation value. Therefore, the covariance matrix elements for the cross term are zero?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should recall that for a state with zero mean, the covariance matrix is:\n\nVar(X) = <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2 = <X\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nVar(P) = <P\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nCov(X,P) = <XP + PX>/2 - <X><P> = 0 -0 =0\n\nWait, but earlier calculation of <XP> was imaginary, but the symmetric part is zero. Therefore, the covariance matrix is diagonal with entries Var(X)=Var(P)= \u03b1\u00b2 +1, and covariance zero. Therefore, the covariance matrix is the same as for a coherent state with \u03b1=0? Wait, no. Wait, a coherent state with \u03b1 has Var(X)=Var(P)= \u03b1\u00b2 + 0.5? Wait, no, let me recall.\n\nWait, for a coherent state |\u03b1>, the quadrature variances are Var(X)=Var(P)=1/2, because coherent states are minimum uncertainty states. Wait, but here we have Var(X)= \u03b1\u00b2 +1? That can't be right. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me compute Var(X) for the cat state.\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] / 2\n\nWe had earlier that <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0, and <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1. Therefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [0 +0 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1)] /2 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nSimilarly for <P\u00b2>.\n\nBut for a coherent state |\u03b1>, the variance of X is 1/2. Wait, that's conflicting. So there must be an error in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me recall that for a coherent state |\u03b1>, the expectation value of X is sqrt(2) Re(\u03b1), and the variance is 1/2. Let me verify with \u03b1 real for simplicity.\n\nLet \u03b1 be real. Then, X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2. For |\u03b1>, <X> = (\u03b1 + \u03b1)/\u221a2 = sqrt(2) \u03b1. The variance is <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2.\n\nCompute <X\u00b2> for |\u03b1>:\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2\n\nBut for |\u03b1>, <a\u00b2> =0 (since a |\u03b1> = \u03b1 |\u03b1>, so <a\u00b2> = \u03b1 <a> = \u03b1\u00b2 <1>, but wait, actually, <a\u00b2> for a coherent state is zero?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me compute <a\u00b2> for |\u03b1>:\n\na\u00b2 |\u03b1> = a (a |\u03b1>) = a (\u03b1 |\u03b1>) = \u03b1 a |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 |\u03b1>\n\nTherefore, <a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1|\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2. Similarly, <a\u2020\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nWait, so <a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2, <a\u2020\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2, and <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a +1> = |\u03b1|\u00b2 +1 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b2 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] /2 = [2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 ] /2 = [4 \u03b1\u00b2 +2]/2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nWait, but that contradicts the known variance of 1/2 for coherent states. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, the variance of X for a coherent state is indeed 1/2, but my calculation must be wrong. Let me recast.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of X. Let me recall that the quadrature operators are usually defined as X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2), and P = (a - a\u2020)/i\u221a(2). Then, the commutator [X, P] = i.\n\nThe variance of X in a coherent state is indeed 1/2. Let me compute it properly.\n\nFor a coherent state |\u03b1>, compute <X\u00b2>:\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] / 2\n\nBut for |\u03b1>:\n\n<a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2 <1> = \u03b1\u00b2\n\n<a\u2020\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2\n\n<a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a +1> = |\u03b1|\u00b2 +1 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nTherefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b2 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] /2 = [2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 ] /2 = (4 \u03b1\u00b2 +2)/2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nThen, <X> = sqrt(2) \u03b1, so Var(X) = <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2 = (2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1) - 2 \u03b1\u00b2 =1. Wait, that's variance 1? But that contradicts the known variance of 1/2. So clearly, I have a mistake in the normalization.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the quadrature operators are defined with a different normalization. Let me check standard definitions.\n\nIn quantum optics, the quadrature operators are often defined as:\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2)\n\nP = (a - a\u2020)/i\u221a(2)\n\nThen, the commutator [X, P] = i.\n\nThe variance of X in a coherent state is indeed 1/2. Let me see:\n\nWait, let me recalculate with this definition.\n\nCompute <X\u00b2> for |\u03b1>:\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] / 2\n\nBut <a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2, <a\u2020\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2, <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b2 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] /2 = [2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 ] /2 = (4 \u03b1\u00b2 +2)/2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nThen, Var(X) = <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2 = (2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1) - ( (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 )^2 evaluated at |\u03b1>.\n\nWait, <X> = < (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 > = (\u03b1 + \u03b1)/\u221a2 = sqrt(2) \u03b1. Therefore, <X>\u00b2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nThus, Var(X) = (2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1) - 2 \u03b1\u00b2 =1. Hmm, but that's variance 1, but I thought it was 1/2. There must be a different normalization.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadrature operators are defined with a different scaling factor. Let me check another source.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadrature operators are defined as X = a + a\u2020 and P = i(a\u2020 - a), so that [X, P] = 2i. Then the variance would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variance is 1/2 when using the standard definition. Let me see:\n\nSuppose X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2), then Var(X) = <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2.\n\nFor a coherent state |\u03b1>:\n\n<X> = (\u03b1 + \u03b1)/\u221a2 = sqrt(2) \u03b1\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2 = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b2 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] /2 = (2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2)/2 = (4 \u03b1\u00b2 +2)/2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nThus Var(X) = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1 - 2 \u03b1\u00b2 =1. Hmm, so variance is 1? That contradicts my previous knowledge. Wait, maybe I was mistaken before. Let me check with \u03b1=0 (vacuum state):\n\nFor \u03b1=0, Var(X) =1. But the vacuum state has Var(X)=1/2?\n\nWait, no, in the vacuum state, <X> =0, and <X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 /2 > = [0 +0 + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2. Since in vacuum, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a +1> =0 +1=1. So <X\u00b2> = (0 +0 +2*1)/2 =1. So Var(X)=1. But that's not the minimum uncertainty. Wait, the vacuum state is a coherent state with \u03b1=0, so it should have Var(X)=1/2?\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Maybe the quadrature operators are defined differently. Let me check a standard reference.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the quadrature operators are defined as:\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2)\n\nP = (a - a\u2020)/i\u221a(2)\n\nThen, the commutator [X, P] = i.\n\nThe variance of X in a coherent state is indeed 1/2. Wait, but according to my calculation, it's 1. There must be an error.\n\nWait, let me recalculate for the vacuum state (\u03b1=0):\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2\n\nIn vacuum, <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a +1> =0 +1=1.\n\nTherefore, <X\u00b2> = [0 +0 +2*1]/2 =1. So Var(X)=1. But that contradicts the expectation of minimum uncertainty.\n\nWait, perhaps the variance is defined as (\u0394X)^2 = <X\u00b2> - <X>^2. For vacuum, <X>=0, so Var(X)=1. But the minimum uncertainty product is (\u0394X)(\u0394P)=1/2. Let me compute \u0394P.\n\nCompute <P\u00b2> for vacuum:\n\nP = (a - a\u2020)/i\u221a2\n\n<P\u00b2> = < (a - a\u2020)^2 / (-2) > = [ <a\u00b2> - 2 <a a\u2020> + <a\u2020\u00b2> ] / (-2)\n\nIn vacuum, <a\u00b2>=0, <a\u2020\u00b2>=0, <a a\u2020>=1.\n\nThus,\n\n<P\u00b2> = [0 -2*1 +0]/(-2) = (-2)/(-2)=1\n\nTherefore, Var(P)=1. So (\u0394X)(\u0394P)=1*1=1, but the minimum uncertainty product is 1/2. So something is wrong here.\n\nAh! I see the mistake. The standard definition uses different scaling. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadrature operators are defined with a factor of 1/\u221a(2) instead of \u221a2. Let me see:\n\nSuppose X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2), then the variance is 1, but if they are defined as X = (a + a\u2020), then the variance would be different. Alternatively, maybe the commutation relation is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variance is scaled by 1/2. Let me see:\n\nWait, in some conventions, the quadrature operators are defined as X = a + a\u2020 and P = i(a\u2020 - a), so that [X, P] = 2i. Then, the variance would be:\n\nFor vacuum state,\n\n<X> =0,\n\n<X\u00b2> = <a\u00b2 + 2 a a\u2020 + a\u2020\u00b2> =0 +2*1 +0=2,\n\nso Var(X)=2,\n\nSimilarly, <P\u00b2> = < - (a - a\u2020)^2 > = - <a\u00b2 - 2 a a\u2020 + a\u2020\u00b2> = - (0 -2*1 +0)=2,\n\nso Var(P)=2,\n\nthen (\u0394X)(\u0394P)=2*2=4, which is worse.\n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should step back.\n\nThe key point is that for the cat state, the first moments are zero, and the second moments (the variances of X and P) are the same as for a coherent state with \u03b1=0? Wait, no. Wait, in our calculation for the cat state with \u03c6=-\u03c0/4 and \u03b1=0.5, the Var(X) and Var(P) are both equal to \u03b1\u00b2 +1 =0.25 +1=1.25. Whereas for a coherent state with \u03b1=0.5, the Var(X) would be 1 (from previous calculation). Wait, but that contradicts the idea that the covariance matrix is the same as a Gaussian state. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state (\u03b1=0). Let me see.\n\nIf the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state, then its entropy is zero (since it's a pure Gaussian state). The cat state is also a pure state, so its entropy is zero, so del_b would be 0-0=0, which is option B. But that can't be right because the cat state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state. Since the first moments are zero, and the second moments are Var(X)=Var(P)=1.25, then the Gaussian state with those moments would be a thermal state or a squeezed state?\n\nWait, a thermal state has Var(X)=Var(P)=n+1/2, where n is the mean photon number. If Var(X)=1.25, then n+0.5=1.25 => n=0.75. So a thermal state with n=0.75. But the entropy of a thermal state is S = (n+1) ln(n+1) - n ln n. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a coherent state with zero displacement (vacuum), but then its entropy is zero, and the cat state's entropy is also zero, so difference is zero. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix as the cat state. Since the covariance matrix of the cat state has Var(X)=Var(P)=1.25 and zero covariance, that would correspond to a thermal state with Var(X)=1.25. Let me compute the entropy of the cat state and the thermal state.\n\nWait, the cat state is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. The thermal state is mixed, so its entropy is positive. Therefore, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But the problem says \"amount of non-Gaussianity\", so maybe it's the absolute value? Or perhaps the problem defines it as S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive. But the problem's formula is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Since S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho), so del_b = - [S(rho) - S(tau)]. So del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). Therefore, if the cat state is pure (S(rho)=0), then del_b = S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity would be the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the problem's definition. Let me recheck:\n\nThe problem says: \"del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]\". So del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Since S(rho) = - Tr(rho ln rho), so del_b = - [S(rho) - S(tau)]. Therefore, del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). So if the cat state is pure (S(rho)=0), then del_b = S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity is the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But that would mean that the more mixed the reference Gaussian state is, the higher the non-Gaussianity. But I'm not sure if that's the standard measure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to the cat state in terms of some metric, and the non-Gaussianity is the entropy difference. But without knowing which Gaussian state is the reference, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think of the entropy of the cat state. Since it's a pure state, its entropy is zero. The reference Gaussian state is also a pure Gaussian state (like a coherent state), so its entropy is also zero. Therefore, del_b =0 -0=0, which is option B. But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the fact that the cat state is non-Gaussian. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a mixed state. For example, the mixture of the two coherent states |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1> with equal weights. Even though that's not Gaussian, but perhaps the problem considers it as a reference? But then its entropy would be S = - p ln p - (1-p) ln (1-p) where p=0.5, so S= ln 2 \u22480.693. Then del_b would be 0 - ln2 \u2248-0.693, but the problem asks for the amount, so absolute value? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state. Then del_b =0 -0=0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition where the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, but the formula given is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the cat state is pure. Wait, let me check the normalization again.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)). For \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, sin(2\u03c6)=sin(-\u03c0/2)= -1. So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)). With \u03b1=0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=exp(-0.5)\u22480.6065, so N\u2248sqrt(1 -0.6065)=sqrt(0.3935)=\u22480.627. So the state is indeed normalized and pure, so its entropy is zero.\n\nThe problem's formula for del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)= - S(rho)=0. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau). So del_b is equal to -S(tau). Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is the negative of the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But that would mean that the more mixed the reference Gaussian state is, the higher the non-Gaussianity. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that is the closest to the cat state in terms of the relative entropy. In that case, the non-Gaussianity would be S(rho || tau), which is the minimal relative entropy between the cat state and any Gaussian state. But the problem's formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reference Gaussian state as the vacuum state, so del_b =0 -0=0, but that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix as the cat state. Let me compute the entropy of such a Gaussian state.\n\nThe covariance matrix for the cat state has Var(X)=Var(P)=\u03b1\u00b2 +1=0.25+1=1.25, and zero covariance. So the covariance matrix is diagonal with entries 1.25 and 1.25. The entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = ln (sqrt(det(\u03a3)/e^2)), where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in terms of the quadrature operators. Wait, the formula for the entropy of a Gaussian state is S = (1 + ln (det(\u03a3)/2)) where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in terms of the quadrature operators. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nThe entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = (1 + ln (det(\u03a3)/2)) where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in units of the vacuum covariance matrix. The vacuum covariance matrix has determinant (1/2)^2 =1/4, so det(\u03a3_vacuum)=1/4. The entropy of the vacuum is S_vacuum = (1 + ln ( (1/4)/2 )) = 1 + ln(1/8) which is negative, which can't be. Hmm, perhaps I need to recall the correct formula.\n\nActually, the entropy of a Gaussian state with covariance matrix \u03a3 (in terms of the quadrature operators X and P) is given by:\n\nS = ln ( sqrt( det(\u03a3) / (e^2) ) )\n\nWait, let me check a reference. According to some sources, the entropy of a Gaussian state is S = ln ( sqrt( det(\u03a3) / (e^2) ) ), where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in units where the vacuum has covariance matrix diag(1/2,1/2). Wait, perhaps better to use the formula in terms of the symplectic eigenvalues.\n\nThe entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = ln ( sqrt( \u03bb_1 \u03bb_2 ) ), where \u03bb_1 and \u03bb_2 are the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. For a covariance matrix that is diagonal with entries Var(X) and Var(P), and zero covariance, the symplectic eigenvalues are sqrt(Var(X) Var(P) - (Cov(X,P))^2 ) = sqrt(Var(X) Var(P)). Since Var(X)=Var(P)=1.25, then the symplectic eigenvalues are sqrt(1.25 *1.25)=1.25. Therefore, the entropy is ln(1.25). Since S = ln( sqrt(\u03bb1 \u03bb2) ) = ln( sqrt(1.25^2) ) = ln(1.25). Wait, but sqrt(\u03bb1 \u03bb2) = sqrt(1.25 *1.25)=1.25, so S=ln(1.25)\u22480.223.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.\n\nThe entropy of a Gaussian state with covariance matrix \u03a3 is given by:\n\nS = (1 + ln (det(\u03a3)/2)) / ln(e) ?\n\nWait, perhaps in natural logarithm, it's S = ln ( sqrt( det(\u03a3) / (e^2) ) )\n\nWait, let me look up the formula.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia page on Gaussian states: \"The entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = ln(\u221a(det(\u03a3)/e\u00b2)) where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in terms of the quadrature operators.\"\n\nAssuming that the covariance matrix is expressed in terms of the quadrature operators with units such that the vacuum state has covariance matrix diag(1/2, 1/2). Then, for our case, the covariance matrix is diag(1.25, 1.25). The determinant is (1.25)^2 =1.5625. Therefore,\n\nS = ln( sqrt(1.5625 / e\u00b2) ) = ln( sqrt(1.5625)/e ) = ln( (1.25)/e ) = ln(1.25) -1 \u22480.223 -1\u2248-0.777. That can't be, since entropy can't be negative.\n\nHmm, clearly I'm missing something here. Maybe the formula requires the covariance matrix to be expressed in terms of the quadrature operators with units such that the vacuum has determinant (1/2)^2 =1/4. Let me try that.\n\nThe determinant of our covariance matrix is (1.25)^2 =1.5625. The determinant of the vacuum is (1/2)^2=0.25. The formula might be S = ln( sqrt( det(\u03a3)/det(\u03a3_vacuum) ) ). Then,\n\ndet(\u03a3)/det(\u03a3_vacuum) =1.5625 /0.25=6.25. So sqrt(6.25)=2.5. Then S=ln(2.5)\u22480.916.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (1/2) ln( det(\u03a3)/ (e^2) ) +1/2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for a thermal state with mean photon number n, the covariance matrix has Var(X)=Var(P)=n +1/2. The entropy is S = (n+1) ln(n+1) -n ln n.\n\nIf our Gaussian state has Var(X)=1.25, then n +0.5=1.25 => n=0.75. Therefore, the entropy would be S=(0.75+1) ln(1.75) -0.75 ln0.75 \u22481.75 ln1.75 -0.75 ln0.75.\n\nCompute numerically:\n\nln(1.75)\u22480.5596, so 1.75*0.5596\u22480.984.\n\nln(0.75)\u2248-0.2877, so -0.75*(-0.2877)=0.2158.\n\nTotal S\u22480.984 +0.2158\u22481.1998\u22481.2.\n\nSo approximately 1.2. Which is close to option C (1.38) or D (2.48). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state with n=0.75, then del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) =0 -1.2\u2248-1.2, but the problem might take absolute value or define it differently.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem's del_b is defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)), then for pure rho and Gaussian tau, it would be -Tr(rho ln tau). Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)=0, so del_b = -Tr(rho ln tau) - Tr(tau ln tau). Wait, no, the standard relative entropy is S(rho || tau)=Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). So if the problem's del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), then it's different.\n\nGiven the confusion here, perhaps I need to look for another approach.\n\nWait, the problem gives the formula del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)= - S(rho)=0. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau). So del_b is equal to -S(tau). Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is the negative of the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. To maximize non-Gaussianity, the reference Gaussian state should have the least entropy, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that is the closest to the cat state in terms of fidelity, and then compute the entropy difference. But without knowing which Gaussian state that is, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state. Then its entropy is zero, so del_b=0-0=0. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the coherent state |\u03b1>. Let's compute its entropy. A coherent state is pure, so its entropy is zero. Then del_b=0-0=0. But the cat state is non-Gaussian, so this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two coherent states, even though it's not Gaussian. But then its entropy would be S = -0.5 ln0.5 -0.5 ln0.5 = ln2\u22480.693. Then del_b=0 -0.693\u2248-0.693, but the problem might take absolute value, giving\u22480.693, which is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state. As computed earlier, the covariance matrix has Var(X)=Var(P)=1.25. Assuming that Gaussian state is a thermal state with n=0.75, then its entropy is\u22481.2. So del_b=0 -1.2\u2248-1.2, but the options are positive numbers. Maybe the problem defines it as S(tau) - S(rho)=1.2, which is close to option C (1.38). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the entropy of the Gaussian state. Let me recalculate using the formula for thermal state entropy:\n\nS = (n+1) ln(n+1) -n ln n.\n\nWith n=0.75,\n\nS = (1.75) ln(1.75) -0.75 ln(0.75)\n\nCompute:\n\nln(1.75) \u22480.5596157879,\n\n1.75 *0.5596 \u22480.9843,\n\nln(0.75)\u2248-0.2876820724,\n\n0.75*(-0.287682)= -0.21576,\n\nThus S\u22480.9843 - (-0.21576)=0.9843+0.21576\u22481.20006.\n\nSo approximately 1.2. The closest option is C (1.38) or D (2.48). Hmm, 1.2 is closer to 1.38, but not exactly. Maybe there's a different reference state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a squeezed vacuum state with the same covariance matrix. The entropy of a squeezed state is zero because it's pure. Wait, no. A squeezed state is a pure Gaussian state, so its entropy is zero. Then del_b would be 0 -0=0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix as the cat state but with zero mean. Since the cat state has zero mean, then the Gaussian state with covariance matrix diag(1.25,1.25) is a thermal state with n=0.75, which has entropy\u22481.2. So del_b=0 -1.2\u2248-1.2, but the problem might take absolute value, giving 1.2, which is closest to option C (1.38). Maybe the calculation requires more precise computation.\n\nLet me compute the entropy more accurately.\n\nn=0.75,\n\nS = (n+1) ln(n+1) -n ln n\n\n=1.75 ln(1.75) -0.75 ln(0.75)\n\nCompute ln(1.75):\n\nln(1.75)=ln(7/4)=ln7 - ln4\u22481.9459 -1.3863\u22480.5596\n\n1.75*0.5596=1.75*0.5=0.875; 1.75*0.0596\u22480.1043; total\u22480.9793\n\nln(0.75)=ln(3/4)=ln3 - ln4\u22481.0986 -1.3863\u2248-0.2877\n\n0.75*(-0.2877)= -0.2158\n\nThus S=0.9793 - (-0.2158)=0.9793+0.2158\u22481.1951\u22481.20.\n\nHmm, so approximately 1.20. The closest option is C (1.38). Maybe there's a different reference state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix but in terms of photon number. Wait, the covariance matrix in terms of a and a\u2020?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the covariance matrix of the cat state.\n\nEarlier, I computed Var(X)=\u03b1\u00b2 +1. With \u03b1=0.5, that's 0.25+1=1.25. But let me verify this with another approach.\n\nThe variance of X for the cat state can be computed as <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2. Since <X>=0,\n\nVar(X)=<X\u00b2>.\n\nX=(a + a\u2020)/\u221a2,\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 /2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nFor the cat state,\n\n<a\u00b2> =0,\n\n<a\u2020\u00b2> =0,\n\n<a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [0 +0 +2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1)] /2 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nSo that's correct. So Var(X"

            "text": "Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as the cat state. Let me think.\n\nThe cat state is |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. Let me compute its density matrix first. The density matrix rho is |\u03c8><\u03c8|. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let's compute N. The normalization constant N is given by N = sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)). Since \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, let's compute sin(2\u03c6). 2\u03c6 = -\u03c0/2, so sin(-\u03c0/2) = -1. Therefore, sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) = -exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = -exp(-0.5). Therefore, N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Let me compute that numerically. exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 \u2248 0.3935, so sqrt(0.3935) \u2248 0.627. So N \u2248 0.627. Let me note that.\n\nNow, the density matrix rho is (1/N\u00b2)(cos \u03c6 |\u03b1><\u03b1| + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 |\u03b1><-\u03b1| + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 |-\u03b1><\u03b1| + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|). Since phi is -\u03c0/4, cos(phi) = cos(-\u03c0/4) = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.7071, sin(phi) = sin(-\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2 \u2248 -0.7071. Therefore, cos(phi) sin(phi) = (\u221a2/2)(-\u221a2/2) = -0.5. Similarly, sin(phi) cos(phi) is the same. So the cross terms are -0.5 |\u03b1><-\u03b1| and -0.5 |-\u03b1><\u03b1|. The diagonal terms are (cos\u00b2 phi)|\u03b1><\u03b1| + sin\u00b2 phi |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|. Since cos\u00b2(-\u03c0/4) = 0.5, sin\u00b2(-\u03c0/4)=0.5, so the diagonal terms are 0.5 |\u03b1><\u03b1| + 0.5 |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|. But then multiplied by 1/N\u00b2. Wait, but N\u00b2 is 1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Since sin(2\u03c6) is -1, so N\u00b2 = 1 - exp(-0.5). Therefore, the density matrix is [0.5(|\u03b1><\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|) - 0.5(|\u03b1><-\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><\u03b1|)] / (1 - exp(-0.5)). Hmm, that's the density matrix.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to write it as:\n\nrho = (1/N\u00b2)[cos\u00b2 \u03c6 |\u03b1><\u03b1| + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 |-\u03b1><-\u03b1| + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (|\u03b1><-\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><\u03b1|)]\n\nBut with the given phi and alpha, substituting the values:\n\ncos\u00b2(phi) = 0.5, sin\u00b2(phi) = 0.5, cos(phi) sin(phi) = -0.5. So:\n\nrho = (1/(1 - exp(-0.5))) [0.5 |\u03b1><\u03b1| + 0.5 |-\u03b1><-\u03b1| - 0.5 (|\u03b1><-\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><\u03b1|) ]\n\nSo that simplifies to:\n\nrho = [ (0.5(|\u03b1><\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|) - 0.5(|\u03b1><-\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><\u03b1|) ) ] / (1 - exp(-0.5))\n\nHmm, okay. Now, the reference Gaussian state tau. Since the problem says \"a reference Gaussian state\", but doesn't specify which one. Maybe it's the Gaussian state that is the closest to the cat state in terms of some metric? But since the problem gives a formula for del_b as the difference between the entropies, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state? Because Gaussian states are determined by their first and second moments, so if we compute the first and second moments of the cat state and then construct the Gaussian state with those moments, then compute the entropy difference between the cat state and that Gaussian state, that would be the measure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the coherent state |\u03b1>, but then the problem would need to specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the vacuum state? ",

            "text": "But option B is 0, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, but maybe the cat state is not a pure state? Wait, let me check the normalization. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)). Let me confirm that. The inner product of (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>) with itself is cos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 2 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| -\u03b1>. The inner product <\u03b1| -\u03b1> is exp(-|\u03b1 - (-\u03b1)|\u00b2) = exp(- (2 \u03b1)^2 )? Wait, no. Wait, the inner product between |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1> is <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-|\u03b1 + \u03b1|\u00b2 / 2) ? Wait, actually, the inner product between coherent states |\u03b1> and |\u03b2> is exp(-|\u03b1|\u00b2/2 - |\u03b2|\u00b2/2 + \u03b1* \u03b2). Wait, let me recall the formula for the inner product of coherent states.\n\nThe coherent state |\u03b1> is defined as the eigenstate of the annihilation operator a with eigenvalue \u03b1. The inner product <\u03b2|\u03b1> is exp(-|\u03b1|\u00b2/2 - |\u03b2|\u00b2/2 + \u03b1* \u03b2). Therefore, <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-|\u03b1|\u00b2 - |\u03b1|\u00b2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)^*) = exp(-2|\u03b1|\u00b2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)^*). Wait, but \u03b1 is a complex number, but in the problem, it's given as \"amplitude\", so maybe it's real? Let me assume \u03b1 is real for simplicity, as the problem didn't specify otherwise. So if \u03b1 is real, then <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)) = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2 - \u03b1\u00b2) = exp(-3 \u03b1\u00b2). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recast.\n\nWait, if \u03b1 is real, then \u03b2 = -\u03b1 is also real. So <\u03b2|\u03b1> = exp(-|\u03b1|\u00b2/2 - |\u03b2|\u00b2/2 + \u03b1 \u03b2). Since \u03b2 = -\u03b1, this becomes exp(-\u03b1\u00b2/2 - \u03b1\u00b2/2 + \u03b1*(-\u03b1)) = exp(-\u03b1\u00b2 - \u03b1\u00b2) = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Wait, that's better. So <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Therefore, the inner product of the state (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>) with itself is:\n\ncos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 2 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) = 1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Therefore, the normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)), which matches the given N. So the state is indeed a pure state, so its density matrix is pure, so its entropy S(rho) is zero. Therefore, if the reference Gaussian state is also a pure Gaussian state (like a coherent state), then its entropy is also zero, so del_b would be 0 - 0 = 0, which is option B. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem gives other options. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a mixed state?\n\nWait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two coherent states, which is a mixed Gaussian state? Wait, but earlier I thought that a mixture of two coherent states is not Gaussian. Let me confirm that. The density matrix of a mixture of two coherent states is (|\u03b1><\u03b1| + |-\u03b1><-\u03b1|)/2. The Wigner function of this state is (W_\u03b1 + W_{-\u03b1}) / 2, where W_\u03b1 is the Wigner function of |\u03b1>. Since each Wigner function is a Gaussian centered at (p,q) = (Re(\u03b1), Im(\u03b1)) and (-Re(\u03b1), -Im(\u03b1)), respectively. The sum of two Gaussians is not a Gaussian, so the mixture is non-Gaussian. Therefore, that can't be the reference Gaussian state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state. Let me compute the first and second moments of the cat state.\n\nThe first moment (mean) of the cat state is <\u03c8| a |\u03c8>. Let me compute that. Since the state is |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. The annihilation operator a acting on |\u03b1> gives \u03b1 |\u03b1>, and on |-\u03b1> gives -\u03b1 |-\u03b1>. Therefore,\n\n<\u03c8| a |\u03c8> = (1/N\u00b2)[cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 < -\u03b1 | a | \u03b1> + cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a |\u03b1> + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> ]\n\nWait, actually, let me compute it step by step. Let me denote the state as |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. Then,\n\n<\u03c8| a |\u03c8> = (1/N\u00b2)[cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| ] a [cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> ]\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= (1/N\u00b2)[ cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a |\u03b1> + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a |\u03b1> + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> ]\n\nNow, compute each term:\n\n<\u03b1| a |\u03b1> = \u03b1 <\u03b1|\u03b1> = \u03b1 (since |\u03b1> is normalized)\n\nSimilarly, <-\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> = (-\u03b1) <-\u03b1|-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\n\nThe cross terms:\n\n<\u03b1| a |-\u03b1> = <\u03b1| (-\u03b1) |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = -\u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) (since <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) as before)\n\nSimilarly, <-\u03b1| a |\u03b1> = <-\u03b1| \u03b1 |\u03b1> = \u03b1 <-\u03b1| \u03b1> = \u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nPutting all together:\n\n= (1/N\u00b2)[ cos\u00b2 \u03c6 * \u03b1 + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (-\u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)) + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)) + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 (-\u03b1) ]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\n\nSecond term: - cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 \u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nThird term: + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u03b1 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nFourth term: - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\n\nNotice that the second and third terms cancel each other because they are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So they sum to zero.\n\nTherefore, remaining terms:\n\ncos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1 = \u03b1 (cos\u00b2 \u03c6 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6) = \u03b1 cos(2\u03c6)\n\nGiven that \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, so 2\u03c6 = -\u03c0/2, so cos(2\u03c6) = cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0. Therefore, the first moment <a> is zero.\n\nHmm, interesting. So the mean displacement is zero. That's because the superposition of |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1> with equal weights (since cos\u00b2 and sin\u00b2 terms when \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4? Wait, cos(-\u03c0/4) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, so cos^2 and sin^2 are both 0.5. So the coefficients squared are equal, so the mean displacement cancels out. So the first moment is zero.\n\nNow, the second moments. The second moments for a Gaussian state are determined by the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix elements are <a^2>, <a\u2020^2>, <a a\u2020>, etc. But for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix is determined by the variances and covariances of the quadrature operators. Alternatively, the second moments can be computed as <a^2>, <a\u2020^2>, and <a a\u2020>.\n\nLet me compute <a^2> for the cat state. Let's compute <\u03c8| a\u00b2 |\u03c8>.\n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n<\u03c8| a\u00b2 |\u03c8> = (1/N\u00b2)[cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| ] a\u00b2 [cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> ]\n\nFirst, compute a\u00b2 |\u03b1>:\n\na\u00b2 |\u03b1> = a (a |\u03b1>) = a (\u03b1 |\u03b1>) = \u03b1 a |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 |\u03b1>\n\nSimilarly, a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = a (a |-\u03b1>) = a (-\u03b1 |-\u03b1>) = -\u03b1 a |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>\n\nTherefore,\n\n= (1/N\u00b2)[ cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> ]\n\nBreaking down each term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |\u03b1> = cos\u00b2 \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1|\u03b1>) = cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> )\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 |\u03b1> = sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2) <-\u03b1| \u03b1> (Wait, no. Wait, a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> is -\u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>, so when acting on |-\u03b1>, a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>, so <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = <\u03b1| (-\u03b1\u00b2) |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1>\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, the second term is cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (a\u00b2 acting on |-\u03b1> is -\u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>, so <\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = -\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> )\n\nSimilarly, the third term is sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 |\u03b1> = sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (a\u00b2 acting on |\u03b1> is \u03b1\u00b2 |\u03b1>, so <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 <-\u03b1| \u03b1> )\n\nFourth term: sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2) <-\u03b1| -\u03b1> = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2)\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2))\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2))\n\nFourth term: - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nAgain, the second and third terms cancel each other because they are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (since cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 = -0.5 when \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, but the terms are multiplied by -\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) and +\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2), so they cancel).\n\nTherefore, remaining terms:\n\ncos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 (cos\u00b2 \u03c6 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6) = \u03b1\u00b2 cos(2\u03c6)\n\nAgain, with \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, cos(2\u03c6) = cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0. Therefore, <a\u00b2> = 0.\n\nHmm, interesting. So the second moment <a\u00b2> is also zero. Wait, but that can't be right? Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me recast with \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4. Then cos(2\u03c6) = cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0, so indeed, the terms cancel. So <a\u00b2> = 0. Similarly, <a\u2020\u00b2> would also be zero by the same logic.\n\nWait, but the expectation value of a^2 is zero? That seems odd, but given the symmetry of the state, maybe it's possible. Let me think of the state as a superposition of |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1>, so when you square the annihilation operator, which lowers the state twice, but given the symmetry, maybe it cancels out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, let's compute <a\u00b2> again step by step.\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nFourth term: - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSo cos\u00b2 \u03c6 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6 = cos(2\u03c6) = 0, so those terms cancel.\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (-\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2))\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2))\n\nThese terms are cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 * (-\u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) + \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)) = 0. So yes, they cancel. So indeed, <a\u00b2> = 0.\n\nSimilarly, <a\u2020\u00b2> would be zero as well.\n\nNow, the other second moment is <a a\u2020>. Let's compute that.\n\nThe expectation value <a a\u2020> is equal to <a\u2020 a> + <1>, but actually, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a> + <1>, but since <1> is 1 (because the state is normalized), but actually, let me compute it directly.\n\nWait, <a a\u2020> is the expectation value of the number operator plus 1? Wait, a\u2020 a is the number operator, so a a\u2020 = a\u2020 a + 1. Therefore, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a> + 1 = <n> + 1. Since for a coherent state |\u03b1>, <n> = |\u03b1|\u00b2, so for the cat state, let's compute <a\u2020 a>.\n\nAlternatively, compute <a a\u2020> directly.\n\nCompute <\u03c8| a a\u2020 |\u03c8>.\n\nFirst, note that a a\u2020 = a\u2020 a + 1, so <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a> + 1. Let me compute <a\u2020 a>.\n\nThe expectation value of the number operator <n> = <a\u2020 a>.\n\nLet me compute <\u03c8| a\u2020 a |\u03c8>.\n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n<\u03c8| a\u2020 a |\u03c8> = (1/N\u00b2)[cos \u03c6 <\u03b1| + sin \u03c6 <-\u03b1| ] a\u2020 a [cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1> ]\n\nFirst, compute a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = a\u2020 (a |\u03b1>) = a\u2020 (\u03b1 |\u03b1>) = \u03b1 a\u2020 |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 |\u03b1> + \u03b1 (since a\u2020 |\u03b1> = (\u03b1 + d/d\u03b1) |\u03b1>, but actually, more straightforwardly, for coherent states, <n> = |\u03b1|\u00b2. Wait, actually, for a coherent state |\u03b1>, <a\u2020 a> = |\u03b1|\u00b2. Therefore, <a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = |\u03b1|\u00b2 |\u03b1>.\n\nSimilarly, <a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = | -\u03b1 |\u00b2 |-\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>.\n\nTherefore,\n\n= (1/N\u00b2)[ cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> + cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> ]\n\nBreaking down each term:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = cos\u00b2 \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1|\u03b1>) = cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 <\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> )\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <-\u03b1| \u03b1> )\n\nFourth term: sin\u00b2 \u03c6 <-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 (\u03b1\u00b2 <-\u03b1| -\u03b1> ) = sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, < -\u03b1 | a\u2020 a | -\u03b1 > is < -\u03b1 | (a\u2020 a) | -\u03b1 >. Since | -\u03b1 > is a coherent state, so <a\u2020 a> for |-\u03b1> is | -\u03b1 |\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2. Therefore, the fourth term is sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the inner product < -\u03b1 | -\u03b1 > is 1, so the fourth term is sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me correct:\n\nWait, the operator a\u2020 a acts on |-\u03b1>, giving \u03b1\u00b2 |-\u03b1>, so the inner product < -\u03b1 | a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 < -\u03b1 | -\u03b1 > = \u03b1\u00b2 *1. So yes, fourth term is sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, the second term:\n\n<\u03b1| a\u2020 a |-\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1| -\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nThird term:\n\n<-\u03b1| a\u2020 a |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 <-\u03b1| \u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, putting all together:\n\nFirst term: cos\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond term: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nThird term: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nFourth term: sin\u00b2 \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSo combining terms:\n\nFirst and fourth terms: (cos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6) \u03b1\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2\n\nSecond and third terms: cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) + sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) = 2 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) = sin(2\u03c6) \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, total expectation value:\n\n< a\u2020 a > = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + sin(2\u03c6) \u03b1\u00b2 exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) ] / N\u00b2\n\nBut N\u00b2 = 1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2). Therefore,\n\n< a\u2020 a > = [ \u03b1\u00b2 (1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2) ) ] / N\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2 N\u00b2 / N\u00b2 = \u03b1\u00b2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So <a\u2020 a> = \u03b1\u00b2. Therefore, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a> +1 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nWait, but that's the same as for a coherent state. Because in a coherent state, <a\u2020 a> = |\u03b1|\u00b2, so <a a\u2020> = |\u03b1|\u00b2 +1. So the expectation value of a a\u2020 for the cat state is the same as for a coherent state. That's because the cross terms canceled out?\n\nHmm, so the second moments for the cat state are the same as for a coherent state? Let me see:\n\nThe first moment <a> is zero, while for a coherent state |\u03b1>, it's \u03b1. But in our case, the cat state has <a> =0. The second moment <a\u00b2> is zero, while for a coherent state, <a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2. Wait, but in our case, <a\u00b2> is zero, but for a coherent state, it's \u03b1\u00b2. Wait, but the second moment <a a\u2020> is the same as for a coherent state. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the covariance matrix for a Gaussian state is determined by the variances and covariances of the quadrature operators. Let me recall that for a Gaussian state, the covariance matrix elements can be written in terms of <a a\u2020>, <a\u00b2>, etc. Let me think in terms of quadrature operators.\n\nLet me define the quadrature operators X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 and P = (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2). Then the covariance matrix is a 2x2 matrix with elements <X\u00b2>, <P\u00b2>, and <XP>.\n\nCompute <X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] / 2\n\nWe have <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0 (by similar calculation as <a\u00b2>), and <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1. Therefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [0 + 0 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1)] / 2 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nSimilarly, <P\u00b2> = < (a - a\u2020)^2 / (-2) > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> - 2 <a a\u2020> ] / (-2). Wait, let me compute properly:\n\nWait, P = (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2), so P\u00b2 = (a - a\u2020)^2 / (-2). Therefore,\n\n<P\u00b2> = < (a - a\u2020)^2 / (-2) > = [ <a\u00b2> - 2 <a a\u2020> + <a\u2020\u00b2> ] / (-2)\n\nAgain, <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0, so:\n\n= [ -2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] / (-2) = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nThe cross term <XP> = <X P> = < (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 * (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) > = < (a\u00b2 - a\u2020\u00b2 + a a\u2020 - a\u2020 a ) / (i 2) >\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2 term: <a\u00b2> =0\n\n-a\u2020\u00b2 term: -<a\u2020\u00b2> =0\n\na a\u2020 term: <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\n- a\u2020 a term: - <a\u2020 a> = - \u03b1\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\n<XP> = [0 -0 + (\u03b1\u00b2 +1) - \u03b1\u00b2 ] / (i 2) = [1]/(i 2) = -i/(2)\n\nBut since covariance matrices are real, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, actually, the covariance matrix elements are typically taken as <X P> + <P X> over 2 or something? Wait, perhaps I need to compute the expectation value properly.\n\nWait, actually, the covariance matrix elements are usually defined as <X_i X_j> - <X_i><X_j>, but since the mean <X> and <P> are zero here (since <a> =0, so <X> = ( <a> + <a\u2020> ) /\u221a2 =0, similarly <P> =0), so the covariance matrix elements are just <X\u00b2>, <P\u00b2>, and <XP>.\n\nBut the cross term <XP> is imaginary? That can't be. Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation.\n\nLet me recompute <XP>:\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2\n\nP = (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2)\n\nTherefore,\n\nXP = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 * (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) = [ (a)(a) - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2 ] / (i 2)\n\nWait, expanding (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020):\n\n= a^2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\nXP = [a\u00b2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - a\u2020\u00b2 ] / (i 2)\n\nTaking expectation value:\n\n<XP> = [ <a\u00b2> - <a a\u2020> + <a\u2020 a> - <a\u2020\u00b2> ] / (i 2)\n\nWe know <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0, <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1, <a\u2020 a> = \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n= [0 - (\u03b1\u00b2 +1) + \u03b1\u00b2 -0 ] / (i 2) = [ -1 ] / (i 2) = i/(2)\n\nTherefore, <XP> = i/(2). But covariance matrices are real, so perhaps I need to take the real part? Wait, no. The covariance matrix for Gaussian states is real and symmetric, but here the expectation value is imaginary. That suggests that the cross term is imaginary, which might be okay because X and P are real operators, but their product can have an imaginary expectation value?\n\nWait, actually, the covariance matrix is defined using the symmetric correlation matrix, so perhaps we need to compute <XP + PX>/2. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute <XP + PX>/2:\n\nFirst, XP + PX = [a\u00b2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - a\u2020\u00b2 ] / (i 2) + [ (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) * (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 ]\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute XP + PX directly.\n\nWait, XP + PX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 * (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) + (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) * (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020)/(i 2)\n\nSecond term: (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020)/( -i 2 )\n\nWait, because (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) * (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 = (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020)/(i 2)\n\nWait, actually, let me compute:\n\nFirst term: (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 * (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) = [ (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020) ] / (i 2)\n\nSecond term: (a - a\u2020)/(i\u221a2) * (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 = [ (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020) ] / (i 2)\n\nTherefore, XP + PX = [ (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020) + (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020) ] / (i 2 )\n\nBut (a + a\u2020)(a - a\u2020) = a\u00b2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2\n\nSimilarly, (a - a\u2020)(a + a\u2020) = a\u00b2 + a a\u2020 - a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2\n\nAdding them together:\n\n= [a\u00b2 - a a\u2020 + a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2 + a\u00b2 + a a\u2020 - a\u2020 a - (a\u2020)^2 ] / (i 2 )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\na\u00b2 + a\u00b2 = 2a\u00b2\n\n- a a\u2020 + a a\u2020 = 0\n\na\u2020 a - a\u2020 a =0\n\n- (a\u2020)^2 - (a\u2020)^2 = -2 (a\u2020)^2\n\nTherefore, total:\n\n[2a\u00b2 - 2 (a\u2020)^2 ] / (i 2 ) = [a\u00b2 - (a\u2020)^2 ] / (i )\n\nTherefore, <XP + PX>/2 = [ <a\u00b2 - (a\u2020)^2> ] / (2i )\n\nBut <a\u00b2> =0 and <(a\u2020)^2> =0, so this expectation value is zero. Therefore, the symmetric part <XP + PX>/2 has zero expectation value. Therefore, the covariance matrix elements for the cross term are zero?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should recall that for a state with zero mean, the covariance matrix is:\n\nVar(X) = <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2 = <X\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nVar(P) = <P\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nCov(X,P) = <XP + PX>/2 - <X><P> = 0 -0 =0\n\nWait, but earlier calculation of <XP> was imaginary, but the symmetric part is zero. Therefore, the covariance matrix is diagonal with entries Var(X)=Var(P)= \u03b1\u00b2 +1, and covariance zero. Therefore, the covariance matrix is the same as for a coherent state with \u03b1=0? Wait, no. Wait, a coherent state with \u03b1 has Var(X)=Var(P)= \u03b1\u00b2 + 0.5? Wait, no, let me recall.\n\nWait, for a coherent state |\u03b1>, the quadrature variances are Var(X)=Var(P)=1/2, because coherent states are minimum uncertainty states. Wait, but here we have Var(X)= \u03b1\u00b2 +1? That can't be right. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me compute Var(X) for the cat state.\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] / 2\n\nWe had earlier that <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0, and <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1. Therefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [0 +0 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1)] /2 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nSimilarly for <P\u00b2>.\n\nBut for a coherent state |\u03b1>, the variance of X is 1/2. Wait, that's conflicting. So there must be an error in my calculation.\n\nWait, let me recall that for a coherent state |\u03b1>, the expectation value of X is sqrt(2) Re(\u03b1), and the variance is 1/2. Let me verify with \u03b1 real for simplicity.\n\nLet \u03b1 be real. Then, X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2. For |\u03b1>, <X> = (\u03b1 + \u03b1)/\u221a2 = sqrt(2) \u03b1. The variance is <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2.\n\nCompute <X\u00b2> for |\u03b1>:\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2\n\nBut for |\u03b1>, <a\u00b2> =0 (since a |\u03b1> = \u03b1 |\u03b1>, so <a\u00b2> = \u03b1 <a> = \u03b1\u00b2 <1>, but wait, actually, <a\u00b2> for a coherent state is zero?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me compute <a\u00b2> for |\u03b1>:\n\na\u00b2 |\u03b1> = a (a |\u03b1>) = a (\u03b1 |\u03b1>) = \u03b1 a |\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2 |\u03b1>\n\nTherefore, <a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2 <\u03b1|\u03b1> = \u03b1\u00b2. Similarly, <a\u2020\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nWait, so <a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2, <a\u2020\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2, and <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a +1> = |\u03b1|\u00b2 +1 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b2 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] /2 = [2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 ] /2 = [4 \u03b1\u00b2 +2]/2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nWait, but that contradicts the known variance of 1/2 for coherent states. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, the variance of X for a coherent state is indeed 1/2, but my calculation must be wrong. Let me recast.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the definition of X. Let me recall that the quadrature operators are usually defined as X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2), and P = (a - a\u2020)/i\u221a(2). Then, the commutator [X, P] = i.\n\nThe variance of X in a coherent state is indeed 1/2. Let me compute it properly.\n\nFor a coherent state |\u03b1>, compute <X\u00b2>:\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] / 2\n\nBut for |\u03b1>:\n\n<a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2 <1> = \u03b1\u00b2\n\n<a\u2020\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2\n\n<a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a +1> = |\u03b1|\u00b2 +1 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nTherefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b2 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] /2 = [2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 ] /2 = (4 \u03b1\u00b2 +2)/2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nThen, <X> = sqrt(2) \u03b1, so Var(X) = <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2 = (2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1) - 2 \u03b1\u00b2 =1. Wait, that's variance 1? But that contradicts the known variance of 1/2. So clearly, I have a mistake in the normalization.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the quadrature operators are defined with a different normalization. Let me check standard definitions.\n\nIn quantum optics, the quadrature operators are often defined as:\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2)\n\nP = (a - a\u2020)/i\u221a(2)\n\nThen, the commutator [X, P] = i.\n\nThe variance of X in a coherent state is indeed 1/2. Let me see:\n\nWait, let me recalculate with this definition.\n\nCompute <X\u00b2> for |\u03b1>:\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 / 2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] / 2\n\nBut <a\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2, <a\u2020\u00b2> = \u03b1\u00b2, <a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b2 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] /2 = [2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 ] /2 = (4 \u03b1\u00b2 +2)/2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nThen, Var(X) = <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2 = (2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1) - ( (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 )^2 evaluated at |\u03b1>.\n\nWait, <X> = < (a + a\u2020)/\u221a2 > = (\u03b1 + \u03b1)/\u221a2 = sqrt(2) \u03b1. Therefore, <X>\u00b2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2.\n\nThus, Var(X) = (2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1) - 2 \u03b1\u00b2 =1. Hmm, but that's variance 1, but I thought it was 1/2. There must be a different normalization.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadrature operators are defined with a different scaling factor. Let me check another source.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadrature operators are defined as X = a + a\u2020 and P = i(a\u2020 - a), so that [X, P] = 2i. Then the variance would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variance is 1/2 when using the standard definition. Let me see:\n\nSuppose X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2), then Var(X) = <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2.\n\nFor a coherent state |\u03b1>:\n\n<X> = (\u03b1 + \u03b1)/\u221a2 = sqrt(2) \u03b1\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2 = [ \u03b1\u00b2 + \u03b1\u00b2 + 2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1) ] /2 = (2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2 \u03b1\u00b2 + 2)/2 = (4 \u03b1\u00b2 +2)/2 = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1\n\nThus Var(X) = 2 \u03b1\u00b2 +1 - 2 \u03b1\u00b2 =1. Hmm, so variance is 1? That contradicts my previous knowledge. Wait, maybe I was mistaken before. Let me check with \u03b1=0 (vacuum state):\n\nFor \u03b1=0, Var(X) =1. But the vacuum state has Var(X)=1/2?\n\nWait, no, in the vacuum state, <X> =0, and <X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 /2 > = [0 +0 + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2. Since in vacuum, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a +1> =0 +1=1. So <X\u00b2> = (0 +0 +2*1)/2 =1. So Var(X)=1. But that's not the minimum uncertainty. Wait, the vacuum state is a coherent state with \u03b1=0, so it should have Var(X)=1/2?\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Maybe the quadrature operators are defined differently. Let me check a standard reference.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the quadrature operators are defined as:\n\nX = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2)\n\nP = (a - a\u2020)/i\u221a(2)\n\nThen, the commutator [X, P] = i.\n\nThe variance of X in a coherent state is indeed 1/2. Wait, but according to my calculation, it's 1. There must be an error.\n\nWait, let me recalculate for the vacuum state (\u03b1=0):\n\n<X\u00b2> = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2\n\nIn vacuum, <a\u00b2> =0, <a\u2020\u00b2> =0, <a a\u2020> = <a\u2020 a +1> =0 +1=1.\n\nTherefore, <X\u00b2> = [0 +0 +2*1]/2 =1. So Var(X)=1. But that contradicts the expectation of minimum uncertainty.\n\nWait, perhaps the variance is defined as (\u0394X)^2 = <X\u00b2> - <X>^2. For vacuum, <X>=0, so Var(X)=1. But the minimum uncertainty product is (\u0394X)(\u0394P)=1/2. Let me compute \u0394P.\n\nCompute <P\u00b2> for vacuum:\n\nP = (a - a\u2020)/i\u221a2\n\n<P\u00b2> = < (a - a\u2020)^2 / (-2) > = [ <a\u00b2> - 2 <a a\u2020> + <a\u2020\u00b2> ] / (-2)\n\nIn vacuum, <a\u00b2>=0, <a\u2020\u00b2>=0, <a a\u2020>=1.\n\nThus,\n\n<P\u00b2> = [0 -2*1 +0]/(-2) = (-2)/(-2)=1\n\nTherefore, Var(P)=1. So (\u0394X)(\u0394P)=1*1=1, but the minimum uncertainty product is 1/2. So something is wrong here.\n\nAh! I see the mistake. The standard definition uses different scaling. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the quadrature operators are defined with a factor of 1/\u221a(2) instead of \u221a2. Let me see:\n\nSuppose X = (a + a\u2020)/\u221a(2), then the variance is 1, but if they are defined as X = (a + a\u2020), then the variance would be different. Alternatively, maybe the commutation relation is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variance is scaled by 1/2. Let me see:\n\nWait, in some conventions, the quadrature operators are defined as X = a + a\u2020 and P = i(a\u2020 - a), so that [X, P] = 2i. Then, the variance would be:\n\nFor vacuum state,\n\n<X> =0,\n\n<X\u00b2> = <a\u00b2 + 2 a a\u2020 + a\u2020\u00b2> =0 +2*1 +0=2,\n\nso Var(X)=2,\n\nSimilarly, <P\u00b2> = < - (a - a\u2020)^2 > = - <a\u00b2 - 2 a a\u2020 + a\u2020\u00b2> = - (0 -2*1 +0)=2,\n\nso Var(P)=2,\n\nthen (\u0394X)(\u0394P)=2*2=4, which is worse.\n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should step back.\n\nThe key point is that for the cat state, the first moments are zero, and the second moments (the variances of X and P) are the same as for a coherent state with \u03b1=0? Wait, no. Wait, in our calculation for the cat state with \u03c6=-\u03c0/4 and \u03b1=0.5, the Var(X) and Var(P) are both equal to \u03b1\u00b2 +1 =0.25 +1=1.25. Whereas for a coherent state with \u03b1=0.5, the Var(X) would be 1 (from previous calculation). Wait, but that contradicts the idea that the covariance matrix is the same as a Gaussian state. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state (\u03b1=0). Let me see.\n\nIf the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state, then its entropy is zero (since it's a pure Gaussian state). The cat state is also a pure state, so its entropy is zero, so del_b would be 0-0=0, which is option B. But that can't be right because the cat state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state. Since the first moments are zero, and the second moments are Var(X)=Var(P)=1.25, then the Gaussian state with those moments would be a thermal state or a squeezed state?\n\nWait, a thermal state has Var(X)=Var(P)=n+1/2, where n is the mean photon number. If Var(X)=1.25, then n+0.5=1.25 => n=0.75. So a thermal state with n=0.75. But the entropy of a thermal state is S = (n+1) ln(n+1) - n ln n. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a coherent state with zero displacement (vacuum), but then its entropy is zero, and the cat state's entropy is also zero, so difference is zero. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix as the cat state. Since the covariance matrix of the cat state has Var(X)=Var(P)=1.25 and zero covariance, that would correspond to a thermal state with Var(X)=1.25. Let me compute the entropy of the cat state and the thermal state.\n\nWait, the cat state is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. The thermal state is mixed, so its entropy is positive. Therefore, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But the problem says \"amount of non-Gaussianity\", so maybe it's the absolute value? Or perhaps the problem defines it as S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive. But the problem's formula is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Since S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho), so del_b = - [S(rho) - S(tau)]. So del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). Therefore, if the cat state is pure (S(rho)=0), then del_b = S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity would be the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the problem's definition. Let me recheck:\n\nThe problem says: \"del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho)) - trace(tau* ln(tau))]\". So del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Since S(rho) = - Tr(rho ln rho), so del_b = - [S(rho) - S(tau)]. Therefore, del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). So if the cat state is pure (S(rho)=0), then del_b = S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity is the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But that would mean that the more mixed the reference Gaussian state is, the higher the non-Gaussianity. But I'm not sure if that's the standard measure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to the cat state in terms of some metric, and the non-Gaussianity is the entropy difference. But without knowing which Gaussian state is the reference, it's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think of the entropy of the cat state. Since it's a pure state, its entropy is zero. The reference Gaussian state is also a pure Gaussian state (like a coherent state), so its entropy is also zero. Therefore, del_b =0 -0=0, which is option B. But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the fact that the cat state is non-Gaussian. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is a mixed state. For example, the mixture of the two coherent states |\u03b1> and |-\u03b1> with equal weights. Even though that's not Gaussian, but perhaps the problem considers it as a reference? But then its entropy would be S = - p ln p - (1-p) ln (1-p) where p=0.5, so S= ln 2 \u22480.693. Then del_b would be 0 - ln2 \u2248-0.693, but the problem asks for the amount, so absolute value? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state. Then del_b =0 -0=0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different definition where the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, but the formula given is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the cat state is pure. Wait, let me check the normalization again.\n\nThe state is |\u03c8> = (cos \u03c6 |\u03b1> + sin \u03c6 |-\u03b1>)/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2\u03c6) exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)). For \u03c6 = -\u03c0/4, sin(2\u03c6)=sin(-\u03c0/2)= -1. So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-2 \u03b1\u00b2)). With \u03b1=0.5, exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=exp(-0.5)\u22480.6065, so N\u2248sqrt(1 -0.6065)=sqrt(0.3935)=\u22480.627. So the state is indeed normalized and pure, so its entropy is zero.\n\nThe problem's formula for del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)= - S(rho)=0. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau). So del_b is equal to -S(tau). Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is the negative of the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. But that would mean that the more mixed the reference Gaussian state is, the higher the non-Gaussianity. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that is the closest to the cat state in terms of the relative entropy. In that case, the non-Gaussianity would be S(rho || tau), which is the minimal relative entropy between the cat state and any Gaussian state. But the problem's formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reference Gaussian state as the vacuum state, so del_b =0 -0=0, but that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix as the cat state. Let me compute the entropy of such a Gaussian state.\n\nThe covariance matrix for the cat state has Var(X)=Var(P)=\u03b1\u00b2 +1=0.25+1=1.25, and zero covariance. So the covariance matrix is diagonal with entries 1.25 and 1.25. The entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = ln (sqrt(det(\u03a3)/e^2)), where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in terms of the quadrature operators. Wait, the formula for the entropy of a Gaussian state is S = (1 + ln (det(\u03a3)/2)) where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in terms of the quadrature operators. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nThe entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = (1 + ln (det(\u03a3)/2)) where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in units of the vacuum covariance matrix. The vacuum covariance matrix has determinant (1/2)^2 =1/4, so det(\u03a3_vacuum)=1/4. The entropy of the vacuum is S_vacuum = (1 + ln ( (1/4)/2 )) = 1 + ln(1/8) which is negative, which can't be. Hmm, perhaps I need to recall the correct formula.\n\nActually, the entropy of a Gaussian state with covariance matrix \u03a3 (in terms of the quadrature operators X and P) is given by:\n\nS = ln ( sqrt( det(\u03a3) / (e^2) ) )\n\nWait, let me check a reference. According to some sources, the entropy of a Gaussian state is S = ln ( sqrt( det(\u03a3) / (e^2) ) ), where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in units where the vacuum has covariance matrix diag(1/2,1/2). Wait, perhaps better to use the formula in terms of the symplectic eigenvalues.\n\nThe entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = ln ( sqrt( \u03bb_1 \u03bb_2 ) ), where \u03bb_1 and \u03bb_2 are the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. For a covariance matrix that is diagonal with entries Var(X) and Var(P), and zero covariance, the symplectic eigenvalues are sqrt(Var(X) Var(P) - (Cov(X,P))^2 ) = sqrt(Var(X) Var(P)). Since Var(X)=Var(P)=1.25, then the symplectic eigenvalues are sqrt(1.25 *1.25)=1.25. Therefore, the entropy is ln(1.25). Since S = ln( sqrt(\u03bb1 \u03bb2) ) = ln( sqrt(1.25^2) ) = ln(1.25). Wait, but sqrt(\u03bb1 \u03bb2) = sqrt(1.25 *1.25)=1.25, so S=ln(1.25)\u22480.223.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me think again.\n\nThe entropy of a Gaussian state with covariance matrix \u03a3 is given by:\n\nS = (1 + ln (det(\u03a3)/2)) / ln(e) ?\n\nWait, perhaps in natural logarithm, it's S = ln ( sqrt( det(\u03a3) / (e^2) ) )\n\nWait, let me look up the formula.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia page on Gaussian states: \"The entropy of a Gaussian state is given by S = ln(\u221a(det(\u03a3)/e\u00b2)) where \u03a3 is the covariance matrix in terms of the quadrature operators.\"\n\nAssuming that the covariance matrix is expressed in terms of the quadrature operators with units such that the vacuum state has covariance matrix diag(1/2, 1/2). Then, for our case, the covariance matrix is diag(1.25, 1.25). The determinant is (1.25)^2 =1.5625. Therefore,\n\nS = ln( sqrt(1.5625 / e\u00b2) ) = ln( sqrt(1.5625)/e ) = ln( (1.25)/e ) = ln(1.25) -1 \u22480.223 -1\u2248-0.777. That can't be, since entropy can't be negative.\n\nHmm, clearly I'm missing something here. Maybe the formula requires the covariance matrix to be expressed in terms of the quadrature operators with units such that the vacuum has determinant (1/2)^2 =1/4. Let me try that.\n\nThe determinant of our covariance matrix is (1.25)^2 =1.5625. The determinant of the vacuum is (1/2)^2=0.25. The formula might be S = ln( sqrt( det(\u03a3)/det(\u03a3_vacuum) ) ). Then,\n\ndet(\u03a3)/det(\u03a3_vacuum) =1.5625 /0.25=6.25. So sqrt(6.25)=2.5. Then S=ln(2.5)\u22480.916.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is S = (1/2) ln( det(\u03a3)/ (e^2) ) +1/2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that for a thermal state with mean photon number n, the covariance matrix has Var(X)=Var(P)=n +1/2. The entropy is S = (n+1) ln(n+1) -n ln n.\n\nIf our Gaussian state has Var(X)=1.25, then n +0.5=1.25 => n=0.75. Therefore, the entropy would be S=(0.75+1) ln(1.75) -0.75 ln0.75 \u22481.75 ln1.75 -0.75 ln0.75.\n\nCompute numerically:\n\nln(1.75)\u22480.5596, so 1.75*0.5596\u22480.984.\n\nln(0.75)\u2248-0.2877, so -0.75*(-0.2877)=0.2158.\n\nTotal S\u22480.984 +0.2158\u22481.1998\u22481.2.\n\nSo approximately 1.2. Which is close to option C (1.38) or D (2.48). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the reference Gaussian state is the thermal state with n=0.75, then del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) =0 -1.2\u2248-1.2, but the problem might take absolute value or define it differently.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem's del_b is defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)), then for pure rho and Gaussian tau, it would be -Tr(rho ln tau). Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)=0, so del_b = -Tr(rho ln tau) - Tr(tau ln tau). Wait, no, the standard relative entropy is S(rho || tau)=Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). So if the problem's del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), then it's different.\n\nGiven the confusion here, perhaps I need to look for another approach.\n\nWait, the problem gives the formula del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Since rho is pure, Tr(rho ln rho)= - S(rho)=0. So del_b = - Tr(tau ln tau). So del_b is equal to -S(tau). Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is the negative of the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. To maximize non-Gaussianity, the reference Gaussian state should have the least entropy, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one that is the closest to the cat state in terms of fidelity, and then compute the entropy difference. But without knowing which Gaussian state that is, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state. Then its entropy is zero, so del_b=0-0=0. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the coherent state |\u03b1>. Let's compute its entropy. A coherent state is pure, so its entropy is zero. Then del_b=0-0=0. But the cat state is non-Gaussian, so this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two coherent states, even though it's not Gaussian. But then its entropy would be S = -0.5 ln0.5 -0.5 ln0.5 = ln2\u22480.693. Then del_b=0 -0.693\u2248-0.693, but the problem might take absolute value, giving\u22480.693, which is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as the cat state. As computed earlier, the covariance matrix has Var(X)=Var(P)=1.25. Assuming that Gaussian state is a thermal state with n=0.75, then its entropy is\u22481.2. So del_b=0 -1.2\u2248-1.2, but the options are positive numbers. Maybe the problem defines it as S(tau) - S(rho)=1.2, which is close to option C (1.38). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the entropy of the Gaussian state. Let me recalculate using the formula for thermal state entropy:\n\nS = (n+1) ln(n+1) -n ln n.\n\nWith n=0.75,\n\nS = (1.75) ln(1.75) -0.75 ln(0.75)\n\nCompute:\n\nln(1.75) \u22480.5596157879,\n\n1.75 *0.5596 \u22480.9843,\n\nln(0.75)\u2248-0.2876820724,\n\n0.75*(-0.287682)= -0.21576,\n\nThus S\u22480.9843 - (-0.21576)=0.9843+0.21576\u22481.20006.\n\nSo approximately 1.2. The closest option is C (1.38) or D (2.48). Hmm, 1.2 is closer to 1.38, but not exactly. Maybe there's a different reference state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a squeezed vacuum state with the same covariance matrix. The entropy of a squeezed state is zero because it's pure. Wait, no. A squeezed state is a pure Gaussian state, so its entropy is zero. Then del_b would be 0 -0=0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix as the cat state but with zero mean. Since the cat state has zero mean, then the Gaussian state with covariance matrix diag(1.25,1.25) is a thermal state with n=0.75, which has entropy\u22481.2. So del_b=0 -1.2\u2248-1.2, but the problem might take absolute value, giving 1.2, which is closest to option C (1.38). Maybe the calculation requires more precise computation.\n\nLet me compute the entropy more accurately.\n\nn=0.75,\n\nS = (n+1) ln(n+1) -n ln n\n\n=1.75 ln(1.75) -0.75 ln(0.75)\n\nCompute ln(1.75):\n\nln(1.75)=ln(7/4)=ln7 - ln4\u22481.9459 -1.3863\u22480.5596\n\n1.75*0.5596=1.75*0.5=0.875; 1.75*0.0596\u22480.1043; total\u22480.9793\n\nln(0.75)=ln(3/4)=ln3 - ln4\u22481.0986 -1.3863\u2248-0.2877\n\n0.75*(-0.2877)= -0.2158\n\nThus S=0.9793 - (-0.2158)=0.9793+0.2158\u22481.1951\u22481.20.\n\nHmm, so approximately 1.20. The closest option is C (1.38). Maybe there's a different reference state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same covariance matrix but in terms of photon number. Wait, the covariance matrix in terms of a and a\u2020?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the covariance matrix of the cat state.\n\nEarlier, I computed Var(X)=\u03b1\u00b2 +1. With \u03b1=0.5, that's 0.25+1=1.25. But let me verify this with another approach.\n\nThe variance of X for the cat state can be computed as <X\u00b2> - <X>\u00b2. Since <X>=0,\n\nVar(X)=<X\u00b2>.\n\nX=(a + a\u2020)/\u221a2,\n\n<X\u00b2> = < (a + a\u2020)^2 /2 > = [ <a\u00b2> + <a\u2020\u00b2> + 2 <a a\u2020> ] /2.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nFor the cat state,\n\n<a\u00b2> =0,\n\n<a\u2020\u00b2> =0,\n\n<a a\u2020> = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nTherefore,\n\n<X\u00b2> = [0 +0 +2(\u03b1\u00b2 +1)] /2 = \u03b1\u00b2 +1.\n\nSo that's correct. So Var(X",
