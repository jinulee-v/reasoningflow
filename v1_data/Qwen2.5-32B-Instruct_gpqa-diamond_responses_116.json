        "question": "Compounds that have the same molecular formula but are different in their structural arrangement are known as isomers. Isomers have two types, constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but differ in their structures. In stereoisomers, molecules are connected in the same way, but their arrangements in space are different.\nWhich of the following organic moieties show optical isomerism?\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n3. benzophenone\n4. dimethyl fumarate\nA. 3 and 4\nB. 2 and 3\nC. 1, 2 and 4\nD. 1 and 2",
        "response": "To determine which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we need to identify if they can form enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Optical isomerism typically occurs in molecules with at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents).\n\nLet's analyze each compound:\n\n1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: This compound has a biphenyl structure with nitro groups and carboxylate groups attached. The presence of multiple substituents on the biphenyl ring suggests potential chirality, but without detailed structural analysis, it\u2019s not immediately clear if there is a chiral center.\n\n2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: This compound contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOCH3). The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group and the carboxylic acid group is likely to be a chiral center because it is bonded to four different substituents: -OH, -H, -COOCH3, and the rest of the molecule. Therefore, this compound can exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n3. **Benzophenone**: This compound consists of a benzene ring with a ketone group. Benzophenone does not have any chiral centers, so it cannot exhibit optical isomerism.\n\n4. **Dimethyl fumarate**: Fumarate is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond between two carbon atoms, which can exist in either cis or trans configurations. However, for optical isomerism, we specifically look for chiral centers. Since fumarate does not have a chiral center, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n- Compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) shows optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.\n- Compound 3 (benzophenone) and compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) do not show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. 1 and 2**\n\nHowever, since the analysis of compound 1 was inconclusive without more detailed structural information, the most confident answer based on clear evidence is:\n\n**D. 2** (if considering only definitively identified chiral centers). \n\nBut if we consider the provided options and the analysis of the other compounds, the best fit from the given choices would be:\n\n**D. 1 and 2** (assuming compound 1 might have a chiral center based on its complex structure)."
