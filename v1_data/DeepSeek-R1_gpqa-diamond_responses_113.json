        "question": "Select the suitable reagents for the following mentioned reactions.\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\nA.

        "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with water and reagent B to give the corresponding carboxylic acid. The options are combinations of A and B, so I need to determine what each reagent should be.\n\nStarting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is a ketone. When ketones react with cyanide ions, typically in a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones aren't as reactive as aldehydes towards nucleophilic addition. However, maybe they use some kind of acid catalyst? Or perhaps a bisulfite addition?\n\nWait, NaCN is sodium cyanide. In the presence of an acid, maybe? Or maybe they form a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation usually involves adding HCN to a carbonyl. But since we're using NaCN, maybe there's another component. Alternatively, maybe it's a Strecker synthesis? No, that's for amino acids. \n\nWait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be a nitrile group attached to a carbon that's also bearing a hydroxyl group and two methyl groups? Let me draw it out. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. But in a ketone, the carbonyl is less electrophilic. So maybe they activate the carbonyl first. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) can form a bisulfite adduct with ketones, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Wait, but bisulfite addition is usually for aldehydes and methyl ketones. Butan-2-one is a ketone, but it's a methyl and ethyl ketone? Wait, no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl. So methyl ketone. Then NaHSO3 can form a bisulfite adduct with methyl ketones. Then maybe the cyanide can attack? But how does that lead to the hydroxy nitrile?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone. Without any acid catalyst, maybe under specific conditions. But ketones are less reactive. So perhaps the bisulfite acts as a catalyst or forms an adduct that makes the carbonyl more susceptible to attack. Wait, when NaHSO3 adds to a ketone, it forms a sulfonate adduct, which is more water-soluble. But how does that help in adding cyanide?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrin is when HCN adds to a carbonyl, giving a hydroxyl and nitrile group on the same carbon. But HCN is dangerous, so maybe using NaCN and an acid to generate HCN in situ. So if reagent A is H3O+ (acid), then NaCN would react with acid to form HCN. Then the ketone would react with HCN to form the cyanohydrin. That would give the hydroxyl and nitrile groups on the same carbon. Let me check the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Which is exactly the product mentioned. So that would require HCN. So reagent A would be H3O+ (acid) to protonate the carbonyl and generate HCN from NaCN. Then the cyanide attacks the protonated carbonyl, leading to the cyanohydrin.\n\nAlternatively, if reagent A is NaHSO3, then maybe the bisulfite adduct forms first, and then cyanide attacks. But I'm not sure. The bisulfite adduct is usually a reversible reaction. Maybe in some cases, the adduct can be displaced by cyanide. But I think cyanohydrin formation typically uses HCN or a source of HCN. So NaCN plus acid (H3O+) would generate HCN, allowing the addition. So reagent A would be H3O+.\n\nNow looking at the second reaction: converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid using water and reagent B. Nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. Typically, under acidic conditions (like HCl, H2O, heat), the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, it would form an amide first and then acid, but maybe with acid catalyst. So reagent B could be HCl (option A or D) or CH3COOH (options B or C). \n\nBut the reaction here is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to the corresponding carboxylic acid. The hydroxyl group is adjacent to the nitrile. Wait, but hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acid or base. For example, HCl in water with heat would do it. Acetic acid is a weaker acid, maybe not strong enough. So reagent B is likely HCl. So if the first reaction's reagent A is H3O+ (acid) and the second reagent B is HCl, then option D would be A=H3O+, B=HCl. Alternatively, if reagent A is NaHSO3 and B is HCl, that's option A. But earlier, I thought reagent A for the first reaction is H3O+.\n\nWait, let me confirm. For the first reaction: Cyanohydrin formation. The standard method is to add HCN to a carbonyl. Since HCN is toxic, sometimes it's generated in situ by mixing NaCN with a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4. So in the first reaction, NaCN is present, and reagent A would be H3O+ (acid) to protonate the carbonyl oxygen and generate HCN. Then the nucleophilic attack by cyanide (or HCN acting as a nucleophile?) occurs. Wait, but HCN is a weak acid, and the mechanism for cyanohydrin formation typically involves the cyanide ion attacking the carbonyl carbon after protonation. Wait, maybe the carbonyl is protonated, making it more electrophilic, then the cyanide ion attacks. Then the proton from the acid (H3O+) is used. So reagent A would be H3O+ (acid), allowing the formation of the cyanohydrin. So that would correspond to options C or D for reagent A.\n\nThen, for the second reaction, hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. If reagent B is HCl, then under acidic conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze. So HCl and water with heat would do that. Acetic acid might not be strong enough. So reagent B is HCl. So combining A=H3O+ and B=HCl would be option D. Alternatively, if reagent A is NaHSO3, but I thought that's less likely. Let me check again.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the first reaction uses sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) to form a bisulfite adduct, which then reacts with cyanide. But I'm not sure. The bisulfite adduct is usually a way to isolate the adduct, but maybe in some cases, the adduct can react with nucleophiles. For example, in some cases, the bisulfite adduct can undergo nucleophilic substitution if the leaving group is good. But the bisulfite adduct of a ketone would form a sulfonate group attached to the carbonyl carbon. Then, perhaps cyanide could displace the bisulfite? But bisulfite is a poor leaving group. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the bisulfite is acting as a catalyst. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction is a crossed aldol addition? No, but the product is a cyanohydrin. So I think the correct reagent for the first step is H3O+ to protonate the carbonyl, allowing cyanide attack. Therefore, reagent A is H3O+ (options C or D). Then, reagent B is HCl (options A or D). So if D is A=H3O+ and B=HCl, then D is the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check the second reaction again. The hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Another method is using a strong acid like HCl, which protonates the nitrile, making it more electrophilic. Then water attacks, leading to an imidic acid intermediate, which then hydrolyzes to the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, hydroxide could deprotonate water and attack the nitrile. But acidic conditions are more common for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids. So HCl would be suitable. Acetic acid is a weaker acid, so maybe not sufficient. Therefore, reagent B is HCl. So the answer would be D: A=H3O+, B=HCl."
