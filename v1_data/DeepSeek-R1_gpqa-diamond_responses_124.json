        "response": "Okay, so I need to figure out the energy of the third excited state in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator and also determine how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy. The options are given, so maybe I can recall the formula for energy levels in such a system.\n\nFirst, let me remember. In a 3D harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m \u03c9\u00b2 r\u00b2. This is different from the hydrogen atom because the potential here is proportional to r\u00b2, whereas the hydrogen atom has a Coulomb potential proportional to 1/r. The energy levels for the 3D harmonic oscillator are quantized, right?\n\nIn one dimension, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, ...). But in three dimensions, since it's isotropic, the problem becomes separable into three independent one-dimensional oscillators along the x, y, and z directions. So the total energy should be the sum of the energies from each direction. Therefore, the total energy would be E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers.\n\nAlternatively, I think sometimes people use a different notation where the energy levels are characterized by a principal quantum number N, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction: N = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy would be E_N = (N + 3/2) \u0127\u03c9. Each energy level corresponds to different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z that add up to N. The degeneracy (number of linearly independent eigenfunctions) would then be the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers. That's equivalent to the combination formula C(N + 2, 2), which is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nFor example, if N = 0, then the only combination is (0,0,0), so degeneracy 1. Plugging into the formula: (0 + 2)(0 + 1)/2 = 2*1/2 = 1. Correct. For N = 1, the possible combinations are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), so degeneracy 3. The formula gives (1 + 2)(1 + 1)/2 = 3*2/2 = 3. Correct. For N = 2, combinations are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's 6. The formula: (2 + 2)(2 + 1)/2 = 4*3/2 = 6. Correct. So yes, the degeneracy is (N + 2)(N + 1)/2.\n\nNow, the question is about the third excited state. In quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is N = 0 (since E = (0 + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 = 3/2 \u0127\u03c9). The first excited state would be N = 1, second excited state N = 2, third excited state N = 3. Therefore, the energy of the third excited state is E = (3 + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 = (9/2)\u0127\u03c9. That matches option A and B. Then the degeneracy would be (3 + 2)(3 + 1)/2 = 5*4/2 = 10. So degeneracy 10. Therefore, the answer should be (9/2)\u0127\u03c9, 10, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me check again. Ground state is N=0, first excited N=1, second N=2, third N=3. So energy (3 + 3/2)\u0127\u03c9 = 9/2 \u0127\u03c9. Degeneracy (3 + 2)(3 + 1)/2 = 10. So yes, option B.\n\nBut let me check the other options. Option C and D have energy depending on pi squared, hbar squared over mass and r squared. That seems more like a particle in a box or something else. The harmonic oscillator energy doesn't depend on r, since r is a variable in the potential, but the energy levels are quantized and independent of r. So options C and D can be eliminated. Then between A and B, degeneracy 3 vs 10. Since N=3, degeneracy is 10. So answer is B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the counting. Let me recount the degeneracy for N=3. The number of ways to write 3 as the sum of three non-negative integers. Let's list them:\n\nAll permutations of (3,0,0): there are 3 such combinations (since the 3 can be in any of the three positions).\n\nAll permutations of (2,1,0): there are 6 permutations here (3 choices for which coordinate is 2, then 2 remaining choices for which is 1, and the last is 0).\n\nAll permutations of (1,1,1): there's only 1 such combination.\n\nSo total is 3 + 6 + 1 = 10. Yes, that's correct. So degeneracy 10. Therefore, answer B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{B}"
