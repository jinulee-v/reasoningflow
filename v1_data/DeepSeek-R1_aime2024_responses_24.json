        "question": "Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.",
        "response": "Okay, so I need to find out how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. The total population is 900. Let me jot down the given numbers first.\n\nOwnership numbers:\n- Diamond ring (D): 195\n- Golf clubs (G): 367\n- Garden spade (S): 562\n- Candy hearts (C): 900 (since every resident owns one)\n\nOther information:\n- Exactly two items: 437 residents\n- Exactly three items: 234 residents\n\nHmm, so we need to find the number of residents who own all four items. This sounds like a problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how inclusion-exclusion works for multiple sets.\n\nFor four sets, the formula for the union is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |D \u2229 C| - |G \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 C| - |S \u2229 C| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 C| + |D \u2229 S \u2229 C| + |G \u2229 S \u2229 C| - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|\n\nBut wait, in this case, since every resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts (C), the union D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C would actually be the entire population, right? Because everyone owns C, so everyone is in at least one of the sets. Therefore, |D \u222a G \u222a S \u222a C| = 900.\n\nSo, plugging into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\n\n900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|\n\nBut we don't know the pairwise intersections, triple intersections, or the four-way intersection. This seems complicated. Maybe there's another way using the number of people who own exactly two or three items?\n\nLet me think. The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two items, and 234 own exactly three items. Since everyone owns at least one item (candy hearts), the remaining residents must own either one item or all four items.\n\nWait, but candy hearts are owned by everyone, so actually, every resident owns at least one item (C), but they might own C alone or C plus other items. So, the counts for exactly two items would be owning C plus one other item, or two other items? Wait, no. Wait, \"exactly two of these things\". The four things are diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, owning exactly two would mean any two of the four. But since everyone owns candy hearts, owning exactly two would necessarily include candy hearts plus one other item. Because if someone owned two items not including candy hearts, that's impossible since everyone has candy hearts. So, exactly two items must be candy hearts plus one other item. Similarly, exactly three items would be candy hearts plus two other items. And owning all four would be candy hearts plus the other three.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts\". So candy hearts are a separate item, but everyone has it. So when they say \"exactly two of these things\", does \"these things\" refer to the four items (including candy hearts)? Then exactly two would mean two items, one of which is candy hearts and the other is one of D, G, S. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and all four would be candy hearts plus the other three.\n\nBut the problem states: \"there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things\". So \"these things\" refers to the four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So exactly two would be any two of the four, but since everyone has candy hearts, the only way to have exactly two is candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four is all.\n\nWait, but hold on. If someone has candy hearts and, say, a diamond ring, that's two items. If someone has candy hearts and golf clubs, that's two. Similarly, candy hearts and garden spade. But if someone has, say, diamond ring and golf clubs, but not candy hearts, that's impossible because everyone has candy hearts. So all residents have candy hearts, so any other ownership is in addition to candy hearts.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who own exactly two items is the number of people who own candy hearts and exactly one other item. Similarly, exactly three items is candy hearts and exactly two others, and exactly four items is candy hearts and all three others.\n\nTherefore, the total number of residents can be broken down as:\n\nNumber with only candy hearts (exactly 1 item) + exactly two items (candy hearts +1) + exactly three items (candy hearts +2) + exactly four items (candy hearts +3) = 900.\n\nGiven that exactly two items: 437, exactly three items: 234. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of people who own only candy hearts (exactly 1 item).\n- Let y be the number of people who own all four items (exactly 4 items).\n\nThen, x + 437 + 234 + y = 900\n\nSo, x + y = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229\n\nSo, x + y = 229. But we need another equation to find y.\n\nPerhaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's note that the total number of people owning each item:\n\n- Candy hearts: 900\n- Diamond ring: 195\n- Golf clubs: 367\n- Garden spade: 562\n\nBut since everyone owns candy hearts, the counts for the other items include overlaps with candy hearts.\n\nBut how does this relate to the exact counts?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion but considering that everyone is in the candy hearts set.\n\nAlternatively, think of the three other items (D, G, S) and how they overlap with each other and with candy hearts.\n\nWait, since everyone has candy hearts, the overlaps between D, G, S, and C can be considered as C is a universal set. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since everyone has C, we can think of the problem as three items (D, G, S) and C is always present. So, when someone owns D, they own D and C. When someone owns G, they own G and C, etc. So, the counts for exactly two items (including C) would be owning C and one other item. Similarly, exactly three items would be C and two others, and exactly four items would be C and all three others.\n\nTherefore, the counts for exactly two, three, four items correspond to the number of people owning 1, 2, 3 of the non-C items (D, G, S). So, perhaps we can model this as a problem with three items (D, G, S) where:\n\n- The total number of people is 900, each owning at least zero of D, G, S (but since they all own C, but C isn't part of the count here). Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, actually, since everyone owns C, the number of people who own exactly k items (among D, G, S, C) is equal to the number of people who own (k-1) items among D, G, S. Because C is always included.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf someone owns exactly 1 item (among the four), it must be C only.\n\nIf someone owns exactly 2 items, it's C plus one of D, G, S.\n\nIf someone owns exactly 3 items, it's C plus two of D, G, S.\n\nIf someone owns exactly 4 items, it's C plus all three of D, G, S.\n\nTherefore, the number of people who own exactly 1 item (C only) is x = ?\n\nThe number of people who own exactly 2 items (C +1) is 437.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly 3 items (C +2) is 234.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly 4 items (C +3) is y, which we need to find.\n\nAnd total is x + 437 + 234 + y = 900, so x + y = 229.\n\nBut how do we relate this to the ownership counts of D, G, S?\n\nLet me think. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define the variables for the number of people owning certain combinations of D, G, S.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- a: number of people who own none of D, G, S (i.e., only C). This is x.\n\n- b: number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S (i.e., C +1). This is 437.\n\n- c: number of people who own exactly two of D, G, S (i.e., C +2). This is 234.\n\n- d: number of people who own all three of D, G, S (i.e., C +3). This is y.\n\nSo, a + b + c + d = 900.\n\nWhich matches the earlier equation: a = x, d = y, and b = 437, c = 234.\n\nSo, a + d = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.\n\nNow, the total number of people owning D is 195. Similarly, G is 367, S is 562.\n\nBut these counts include people who own D only, D and another, D and two others, etc. Let's express these totals in terms of a, b, c, d.\n\nWait, but since a is people who own none of D, G, S, then:\n\nThe number of people who own D is equal to the number of people who own D only (part of b), plus those who own D and one other (part of c), plus those who own D and two others (part of d).\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait, in terms of D, G, S:\n\n- The total number of people owning D is the sum of:\n\n  - Those who own only D (part of b: exactly one of D, G, S)\n\n  - Those who own D and one other (part of c: exactly two of D, G, S)\n\n  - Those who own D and two others (part of d: all three of D, G, S)\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nTotal D owners = (number who own only D) + (number who own D and G) + (number who own D and S) + (number who own D, G, and S)\n\nBut wait, in our variables:\n\n- The number who own exactly one of D, G, S is b = 437. These are split into three groups: only D, only G, only S.\n\nSimilarly, the number who own exactly two of D, G, S is c = 234. These are split into three groups: D & G, D & S, G & S.\n\nThe number who own all three is d = y.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- b_D: number of people who own only D (part of b)\n\n- b_G: number of people who own only G\n\n- b_S: number of people who own only S\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- c_DG: number of people who own D and G (part of c)\n\n- c_DS: number of people who own D and S\n\n- c_GS: number of people who own G and S\n\nAnd d: number of people who own all three.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nb = b_D + b_G + b_S = 437\n\nc = c_DG + c_DS + c_GS = 234\n\nd = y\n\nTotal D owners = b_D + c_DG + c_DS + d = 195\n\nTotal G owners = b_G + c_DG + c_GS + d = 367\n\nTotal S owners = b_S + c_DS + c_GS + d = 562\n\nSo, we have three equations:\n\n1. b_D + c_DG + c_DS + d = 195\n\n2. b_G + c_DG + c_GS + d = 367\n\n3. b_S + c_DS + c_GS + d = 562\n\nAdditionally, we have:\n\n4. b_D + b_G + b_S = 437\n\n5. c_DG + c_DS + c_GS = 234\n\n6. a + b + c + d = 900, which gives a + d = 229\n\nOur unknowns are:\n\na, b_D, b_G, b_S, c_DG, c_DS, c_GS, d\n\nBut since a = 229 - d, we can express a in terms of d.\n\nBut we need to find d. Let's see if we can solve these equations.\n\nLet me try to express equations 1, 2, 3 in terms of the variables.\n\nFrom equation 1: b_D = 195 - c_DG - c_DS - d\n\nFrom equation 2: b_G = 367 - c_DG - c_GS - d\n\nFrom equation 3: b_S = 562 - c_DS - c_GS - d\n\nNow, substitute these into equation 4:\n\n(195 - c_DG - c_DS - d) + (367 - c_DG - c_GS - d) + (562 - c_DS - c_GS - d) = 437\n\nSimplify:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 - c_DG - c_DS - d - c_DG - c_GS - d - c_DS - c_GS - d = 437\n\nCompute the sum: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124\n\nSo, 1124 - 2c_DG - 2c_DS - 2c_GS - 3d = 437\n\nFactor out the 2:\n\n1124 - 2(c_DG + c_DS + c_GS) - 3d = 437\n\nBut from equation 5, c_DG + c_DS + c_GS = 234\n\nSo substitute that in:\n\n1124 - 2*234 - 3d = 437\n\nCalculate 2*234 = 468\n\nSo, 1124 - 468 - 3d = 437\n\n1124 - 468 = 656\n\nSo, 656 - 3d = 437\n\nSubtract 437 from both sides:\n\n656 - 437 = 3d\n\n219 = 3d\n\nTherefore, d = 219 / 3 = 73\n\nSo, d = 73. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\nWait, let me check this again to make sure.\n\nStarting from equation 4 substitution:\n\nWe had:\n\nSum of b_D + b_G + b_S = 437\n\nExpressed in terms of c_DG, c_DS, c_GS, d:\n\n(195 - c_DG - c_DS - d) + (367 - c_DG - c_GS - d) + (562 - c_DS - c_GS - d) = 437\n\nAdding the constants: 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124\n\nSubtracting terms: -c_DG - c_DS - d - c_DG - c_GS - d - c_DS - c_GS - d\n\nWhich simplifies to: -2c_DG - 2c_DS - 2c_GS - 3d\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n1124 - 2(c_DG + c_DS + c_GS) - 3d = 437\n\nSince c_DG + c_DS + c_GS = 234,\n\n1124 - 2*234 - 3d = 437\n\n1124 - 468 = 656\n\n656 - 3d = 437\n\n656 - 437 = 219 = 3d => d = 73\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\nBut let me verify with another approach to ensure.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nTotal number of residents is 900.\n\nEach resident has at least candy hearts, so we can think of the problem in terms of subsets of {D, G, S}.\n\nThe total number of residents is equal to the sum over all subsets of {D, G, S} of the number of people owning exactly that subset (along with C). So, the possible subsets are:\n\n- {} (only C): x\n\n- {D}: b_D\n\n- {G}: b_G\n\n- {S}: b_S\n\n- {D, G}: c_DG\n\n- {D, S}: c_DS\n\n- {G, S}: c_GS\n\n- {D, G, S}: d\n\nSo, x + b_D + b_G + b_S + c_DG + c_DS + c_GS + d = 900\n\nWhich is the same as x + (b_D + b_G + b_S) + (c_DG + c_DS + c_GS) + d = 900\n\nWhich is x + 437 + 234 + d = 900 => x + d = 229\n\nWe also know the total number of owners for each item:\n\n- D: b_D + c_DG + c_DS + d = 195\n\n- G: b_G + c_DG + c_GS + d = 367\n\n- S: b_S + c_DS + c_GS + d = 562\n\nIf we sum these three equations:\n\n(b_D + c_DG + c_DS + d) + (b_G + c_DG + c_GS + d) + (b_S + c_DS + c_GS + d) = 195 + 367 + 562\n\nLeft side:\n\nb_D + b_G + b_S + 2c_DG + 2c_DS + 2c_GS + 3d\n\nRight side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124\n\nSo:\n\n(b_D + b_G + b_S) + 2(c_DG + c_DS + c_GS) + 3d = 1124\n\nWe know that b_D + b_G + b_S = 437 and c_DG + c_DS + c_GS = 234\n\nSubstitute:\n\n437 + 2*234 + 3d = 1124\n\n437 + 468 + 3d = 1124\n\n905 + 3d = 1124\n\n3d = 1124 - 905 = 219\n\nd = 73\n\nSame result. So that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 73.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if the numbers add up.\n\nIf d = 73, then x = 229 - 73 = 156. So, 156 people own only C.\n\nThen, let's compute b_D, b_G, b_S, c_DG, c_DS, c_GS.\n\nFrom equation 1: b_D = 195 - c_DG - c_DS - d\n\nBut we need more information. Wait, but since we have d =73, let's see if we can find the other variables.\n\nBut maybe it's not necessary. Since the problem only asks for d, which we found to be 73 through two different methods, and both times it checked out, I think we can be confident that 73 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}"
