        "question": "There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that:\n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.",
        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to consider how to place the chips in the grid while satisfying the given conditions. The conditions state that each row and each column must contain chips of the same color, and no additional chip can be added without violating these conditions.\n\nFirstly, let's understand what it means for a row or column to be filled with chips of the same color. If a row or column has any chips, then all chips in that row or column must be of the same color. Additionally, if a row or column is not completely filled, then it cannot have any chips at all because adding a single chip would force the entire row or column to be filled with chips of the same color.\n\nGiven that there are 25 cells in the grid, and we have 25 white chips and 25 black chips available, the only way to satisfy the condition that no additional chip can be added is to fill exactly 5 rows (or equivalently, 5 columns) completely with chips of the same color. This is because filling fewer than 5 rows or columns would allow us to add more chips, and filling more than 5 rows or columns would exceed the total number of chips available.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many ways we can choose which 5 out of the 5 rows (or columns) will be filled. Since we are dealing with a 5x5 grid, choosing 5 rows to be filled is equivalent to choosing 5 columns to be filled. There is exactly one way to choose all 5 rows (or columns) to be filled.\n\nOnce we have chosen which rows (or columns) will be filled, we need to decide whether to fill them with white chips or black chips. For each choice of 5 rows (or columns), we have 2 choices: either all 5 rows (or columns) are filled with white chips, or all 5 rows (or columns) are filled with black chips. Therefore, there are \\(2\\) possible configurations for each choice of 5 rows (or columns).\n\nSince there is only one way to choose which 5 rows (or columns) will be filled, the total number of ways to place the chips in the grid is:\n\\[\n2\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to place the chips in the grid is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
